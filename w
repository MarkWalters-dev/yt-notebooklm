Grimmage is the best epigenetic clock for evaluating risk of death.And if you missed that video, I'll link to it in the right corner.But for now, which biomarkers are included in Grimmage?That's what we'll see here.So first, it includes age, gender, and an epigenetic approximation of smoking, DNA and pack years.And then, Grimmage version 1, which is shown here,Grimmage version 2 actually includes a couple of additional biomarkers,or epigenetic approximations of additional biomarkers,including HSCRP and HbA1c.But for now, I'm only focused on Grimmage version 1.It includes 7 protein biomarkers that may be obscure to many.Actually, it's an epigenetic approximation of those 7 biomarkers.So the first may not be obscure to many who are frequent viewers of the channel.And for that, thank you.It's an epigenetic approximation of Cystatin C,which is a biomarker of kidney function.But as we'll see in a future video,it's also associated with a biomarker of neurodegeneration.Then also, we've got leptin, which may seem familiar to many,but then others that are very obscure.TMP1, PAI1, GDF15, ADM,and the biomarker that I'm going to focus on in this video, B2M.B2M stands for beta-2 microglobulin,which then raises the question of, besides contributing to Grimmage,why is B2M important?The beginning of that story will be illustrated by this paper shown here,where B2M was identified as a systemic pro-aging factorthat impairs cognitive function and neurogenesis.That then raises the question of what's optimal or what may be optimal for B2M.I won't show those data in this video,but it increases during aging,and higher levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.In terms of what's optimal,I have a new Patreon tier dedicated specifically to what's optimal for biomarkers,which now includes B2M, which we can classify not just as a kidney function biomarker,but also we can identify it as an immune-related biomarker,and, as we'll see in a minute, it's related to neurogenesis.Besides B2M, this tier currently includes 35 other biomarkers,almost two and a half hours of video content,57 published references,and note that these aren't the reference ranges which you can get from any LLM these days.This is my interpretation of what may be optimalbased on how each of these biomarkers changes during aging,and or associations with all-cause mortality risk in the largest studies that exist.So if you're interested in that, check it out.In terms of the data from this paper,let's focus on B2M's impact on neurogenesis.First, starting off with the data here.On the y-axis, we've got double-quartin number of cells slash DG.So this is the number of double-quartin expressing cells,which is a neurogenesis biomarker, as I'll show in a minute,in the dentate gyrus, which is a portion of the brain.And in terms of double-quartin being identified as a neurogenesis biomarker,we'll see that story here.So neurogenesis proceeds along a spectrum,from quiescent neural stem cells on the left to mature neurons on the right.And we can see that there's a cell type as identified therethat expresses double-quartin, or DCX positive cells.So double-quartin is well known as a biomarker of neurogenesis.So back to the data on the right, where they compared double-quartin expressing cellsin mice that were treated with B2M for 12 days.And what we can see is that the neurogenesis biomarker, double-quartin,declined by about 20% in just 12 days after exposure,after mice were exposed to B2M.So relatively high levels of B2M impair neurogenesis.And I should also mention that that's importantbecause neurogenesis declines during aging.So when considering that B2M increases during aging,are they causally linked?I'm not sure about the data in people,but this is an association that is not potentially good news.But this is just one part of the story.What happens if we remove B2M?So if adding it is bad for neurogenesis,if we remove B2M, we'd expect that to be good for neurogenesis.And that's what they tested in this study.Again, on the y-axis, we've got double-quartin expressing cells,so this neurogenesis biomarker.And now we've got B2M minus minus mice.So these are B2M knockout mice.In other words, they knocked out the B2M proteinso that these mice didn't have B2M.And note that this is a longitudinal studyas these mice were 18 months old.So this is an 18-month studyof evaluating the effect of B2M on neurogenesis.When compared with the data in aged wild-type mice,which have normal levels of B2M,we can see that the mice that were genetically engineeredto not have B2M had more than two times higher levelsof this neurogenesis biomarker double-quartin.So collectively, these data implicaterelatively high levels of B2M,especially as it occurs during the aging process,as potentially being bad for neurogenesis in people.But could that be true?As I mentioned, these data are in mice.What do the data look like in people?So that's what we can see here,where we're going to look at B2M levelsin brains of people who were controls,who were not diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, AD,and in people who had Alzheimer's disease, AD.And note that this is a post-mortem study.So unfortunately, the people had diedand they biopsied the brains afterwardsand then quantified the amount of B2Mthat was in those brains.And what we can see is that peoplewho were diagnosed with Alzheimer's diseasehad two times higher levels of B2M in the brain,which again is potentially bad news.So with that in mind, what's my data?This isn't just a health and longevity news channel.As I've said this many times,this is also a health and longevity optimization channel.So what's my data?So I currently have six tests for B2M.As I mentioned, I just started measuring it in 2025.And as a quick aside,why I just started to measure this now?After realizing that I'd rather have the actual biomarkersrather than their epigenetic predictionas found in Grimmage,and knowing that B2M is one of the biomarkers,the actual biomarkers that Grimmage is based on,I started measuring B2M in 2025.I wish I'd measured it earlierbecause then I'd have more dataand trying to bring it downor keep it as low as possible.So over those six tests in 2025,average B2M is 1.58 milligrams per liter,which then again raises a question of what's optimal.And without going to the Patreon tier,the what's optimal for biomarkers tier,again, lower is generally better.If you want the actual numbersand you want to see the datathat I used to derive that story, check it out.Also, avoiding an age-related increase.And this story is currently incompleteas I only have one year of dataso I can't evaluate if I'm resisting age-related change.But then it raises a question ofwhat can I do to reduce B2M as I'd like to go lower?For me, my interpretation of the published literatureis that 1.58 milligrams per liter for B2M,while although not terribly high,isn't as low as I'd prefer to be.So in terms of what I can do to potentially reduce it,I'm gonna look at correlations for diet with B2M.And for those who are unfamiliar,how I'm able to do that,since 2015, so for the past 10 plus years,I've weighed almost all of my food,more than 99% with a food scale.I then enter those data into Chronometer,a diet tracking app.And quick shout out, if you wanna use Chronometer,there's a discount link in the video's description.I then pull the Chronometer data into a spreadsheet.So the macros and micros and individual food amounts.So now each dietary period in between testscan be used for the latter test.In other words, if there's a 50-day periodin between blood testing,I can take the average dietary intake for those 50 days,and that lines up with the latter blood test.So now every blood test has an average dietary intake.With enough blood tests,once I get to three blood tests,I can start looking at correlations.Now sure, there's gonna be a lot of noise in the dataafter three blood tests,but as many of you know and have seen on this channel,I have now 60-plus blood testsfor most clinical chemistry-related biomarkers,kidney, liver, immune, et cetera.So I can look at correlationsthat can help drive me towards what's an optimal dietand even supplements.So using that approach,let's take a look at correlations for B2Mover these six tests with dietto see what I could potentially doto bring it towards the lower end of my range.So this is the top portion of that table,and note that correlations for diet with biomarkersfor all biomarkers, not just B2M,with 30 other clinical chemistry biomarkers.And then I also look at correlationsfor diet with metabolomic data.So I have another 600-plus metabolitesthat are correlated with diet.So if you're interested in that,check us out on the correlations tier on Patreon.So for this table,we can see that the lowercase ris the correlation coefficient.And then on the right,we've got the p-valueas a measure of statistical significance.And here I've used just less than 0.05as the standard nominal thresholdfor statistical significance.I'm not using a false discovery rate,and if people are interested in why that's the case,just leave a comment,and I'd be happy to describe my process for thatin the comments under the video's description.So in terms of the correlations,we can see that there are fourthat meet that significance threshold.Cacao beans, and these are raw,organic cacao beans, not nibs,which have a positive correlation,which I've labeled as red.That positive correlation suggeststhat when cacao intake is towardsthe higher end of my range,that's significantly correlatedwith higher levels of B2M.Note that I said correlation.This is not causation.I can't see anything about causation.I can get close to causationby either increasing or decreasinga given amount of food or nutrientbased on these correlations.But again, these are correlations.I'm not presuming causation.On the other hand, inverse correlations,which suggest that higher levels of the foodmay be related to lower levels of B2Minclude almonds, lemon, and potatoes.So what do I do with this information?Well, I try to follow the correlations.If higher cacao is relatedto higher levels of B2M,if I reduce it, that should lower.Again, if correlation equals causation,the only way I can find outis by doing the experiment.So to test that, for the next test,I've removed cacao beans.Additionally, what about almonds?So the correlations only tell uswhether they're increasing or decreasing,but they don't tell us about amount of foodto follow a given correlation.So let's illustrate what the plotfor B2M looks like versus almonds,which is what we'll see here.With B2M on the y-axis,plotted against average daily almond intakethat corresponds to each one of these blood tests.First, we can see that inverse correlation.And then based on extrapolation of the plot,if I want to bring B2M levels lower,I should aim for somewherein the 20 to 25 gram of almond range,at least at a minimum per day.So average almond intake,again, because I track diet,I know exactly how much I'm eating for every day.Average almond intake since test number eight,blood test number eight in 2025,is currently 19 grams per day.And you could say, why not go higher?Why not just jack it up to 25, 30, whatever,50 grams of almonds per day?Well, unfortunately in my data,almond, not just almonds,but overall monounsaturated fat containing foodsare significantly correlated with higher levels of glucose,which is moving in the wrong direction.And you could say, how does that make any sense?Move for our thought to be heart healthy,why would that be positively correlated with glucose?I have no idea,but that's what the data shows in my case.Additionally, almonds are a rich source of oxalateand potentially more importantly,their oxalate to calcium ratio,they have more oxalate than they do calcium,which suggests that oxalate from almondswill be absorbed and not excretedas oxalate binds to calcium one to one.So those are two main reasons why I haven't gone higheras I have to temper,I have to modulate the amount of almondsthat I'm consuming to keep oxalate levels relatively lowand to keep my MUFA levelsfrom going towards their highest level,which again, in my case,is significantly correlatedwith higher levels of glucose.So based on extrapolationof the average of 19 grams per day,currently since the last test,we'd expect that I should see B2M levelssomewhere around 1.5 milligrams per liter,which still isn't as low as I'd like to get it to,but on the other hand,it may not be as high as my two highest tests,which you can see were greaterthan 1.6 milligrams per liter.But remember, this is just part of the story.I've also removed cacopiants.So if both of these foods are somehow involvedin mechanisms that impact B2M,the combination of following these two correlationsmay allow for movement towards lower,you know, towards one or lower than 1.5.But there may be a sneaky food on this listthat the correlations don't yet indicatehow strong of an impact it may have on B2M,and that's strawberries.You can see that strawberries have a significantor close to significant,that P value is 0.06,just outside of that thresholdof P value less than 0.05.So I've been eating a lot of strawberries,more than usual.In fact, since the last test,close to three pounds per day,which is up from around two pounds per day.Now, if strawberries are somehow involvedin mechanisms that impact B2M,even if I follow the cacao bean and almond correlations,if those foods aren't actually involvedin relatively high levels or low levels of B2M,and it's strawberries that are driving that,I may actually see higher levels of B2Mfor the next test.Nonetheless, this is data collection.That story is informativebecause the correlations for cacao and almondswill weaken.The correlation for strawberries will strengthen.And then with that in mind,that'll be more motivationto cut down on my strawberry intake.If B2M is a part of that storywhere high strawberry intakemay be driving B2M higher,I'm going to have no choicebut to cut down on strawberry intake,for sure, not from three pounds per day,to something more moderate,two pounds per day,or even a little lower.It's tough for mebecause I love strawberriesand they're satiating.And part of being on a calorie-restricted dietis eating a variety of foodsthat help keep me satiated,and strawberries are a key component of that.So will it work?Will B2M move lowerfor test number one in 2026?That test is scheduled for January 30th,and if you're watching this on YouTube,it may have been a monthwhere I've actually done this blood test.If you want to see those dataimmediately after they
