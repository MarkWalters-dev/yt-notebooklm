[0.00s]  So I like to propose that we need to better figure out better ways of rewilding our lives.
[6.14s]  And we're doing this by developing microbial building materials where we actually take bacteria and we build them into the structures that we use to build our built environments,
[17.34s]  creating also living walls that contain microbes and plants to allow for improved immune activation of people breathing and working in that space.
[27.12s]  Increased ventilation is also valuable if you have a beneficial microbiome outside your house.
[33.08s]  And even multi-generational living could be improving, right?
[36.06s]  Moving from this very suburban, wealthy environment where we live in our little bubbles to more interacting with each other on a much more day-to-day basis.
[47.56s]  For example, we see that lactobacillus, a bacteria which is generally associated with health in our lung and on our skin and in our gut,
[55.86s]  can be at greater proportions in people who are infants who have older siblings in their home,
[62.50s]  potentially because those older siblings are interacting with the wide world and bringing that wide world back into the home for the children.
[68.56s]  Thank you.
[69.56s]  Thank you.
