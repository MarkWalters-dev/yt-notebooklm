[0.32s]  Resting heart rate and heart rate variability.
[2.56s]  How are they impacted by physical activity, body weight, and diet?
[6.14s]  So first, let's define a few terms.
[8.18s]  So the resting heart rate, or RHR, is the heart rate in beats per minute, BPM, while at rest.
[14.52s]  And the heart rate variability, HRV, is the variability for the time in between heartbeats.
[19.84s]  So if your heart rate is 60 beats per minute, the assumption is that it beats once every second.
[24.28s]  But there's variability in how often the heart beats.
[26.84s]  It may be once every 0.9 seconds, every 1 second, 1.1 seconds, etc.
[32.12s]  So that variability is the heart rate variability.
[34.78s]  All right, so how does the resting heart rate change during aging?
[37.72s]  So this is a study of 90,000 plus people.
[40.26s]  We've got average resting heart rate on the y-axis plotted against age from 20 to 85 years.
[45.54s]  And what we can see is that for both women in green and men in blue,
[49.40s]  the resting heart rate increases up until about 50 years,
[52.22s]  after which it then decreases all the way up to 85.
[54.90s]  What about HRV?
[56.54s]  How does that change during aging?
[58.08s]  So this is from a much larger study of 8.2 million plus subjects.
[62.46s]  And here we're looking at the RMSSD.
[64.92s]  That's the root mean squared of successive differences.
[67.60s]  That's one metric for measuring heart rate variability plotted against age.
[71.72s]  And in this case, it's going from 20 to 60 years.
[74.18s]  And what we can see is when delineating the line for men in blue, but the data for women is similar,
[80.10s]  we can see that heart rate variability is somewhere in the 70s for a 20-year-old,
[85.98s]  and then it declines to about half that in 60-year-olds for both men and women.
[90.26s]  And note, that's for heart rate variability measured in the morning at 6 in the morning.
[93.14s]  For people that measured at 6 o'clock at night, we can see a similar trend in the dashed blue and red lines.
[99.40s]  So in advanced age, on both of these graphs, we can see that that's characterized by relatively low resting heart rate
[107.20s]  and also a low heart rate variability.
[109.66s]  In contrast, youth is characterized by relatively low resting heart rate,
[113.26s]  at least when compared with 50-year-olds, but also a high heart rate variability.
[117.30s]  So with the goal of being chronologically old, but biologically young,
[121.22s]  which factors can impact resting heart rate and heart rate variability?
[124.62s]  And as mentioned in the opening, today I'm going to go through data for physical activity, body weight, and diet.
[130.48s]  So in terms of a measure of daily physical activity, the fitness tracker that I use also gives me data
[136.54s]  not just for resting heart rate and heart rate variability, but the average daily heart rate,
[140.76s]  so the heart rate for the whole day, not just at rest while I'm sleeping in the morning.
[144.62s]  So is the average daily heart rate significantly correlated with resting heart rate or heart rate variability?
[151.08s]  And that's what we can see here.
[152.42s]  So the resting heart rate on the y-axis plotted against my average daily heart rate for each day on the X.
[158.44s]  And what we can see is that the more active that I am on each day,
[161.68s]  that's significantly correlated with a higher next day resting heart rate, significantly correlated.
[166.96s]  Conversely, the more active that I am, as indicated by the average daily heart rate,
[171.06s]  we can see that heart rate variability is significantly lower.
[173.60s]  Now, this raises the interesting idea, you know, about the optimal physical activity dose
[178.72s]  that can minimize next day variations in heart rate variability and resting heart rate,
[183.00s]  while also maximizing fitness.
[184.64s]  And that's beyond the scope of this video.
[186.18s]  I'll probably address that in a future video.
[188.44s]  Actually, I'll investigate it in my data first and then present it in a future video.
[193.08s]  All right, so what about body weight?
[194.34s]  Is that correlated with heart rate variability and resting heart rate?
[197.02s]  So that data is here.
[197.98s]  And I should mention that the data for physical activity, I only had the idea to measure or to start tracking,
[203.10s]  recording and tracking my average daily heart rate in March of 2020.
[206.62s]  Although my fitness tracker has provided that since I started tracking in August of 2018,
[211.32s]  I didn't have the idea to record that.
[213.20s]  I didn't see the usefulness of it until, unfortunately, March of last year.
[216.98s]  But I've been tracking and recording my resting heart rate and heart rate variability since August of 2018.
[222.20s]  So I have almost 1,200 days of data that correspond to my body weight, my morning body weight,
[227.80s]  which I've been measuring every day in the morning since 2015.
[231.32s]  So again, I've got about 1,200 days of data for correlations between resting heart rate on the y-axis
[236.32s]  against body weight on the x.
[238.30s]  And what we can see is that the higher my body weight,
[241.02s]  that's significantly correlated with a higher resting heart rate.
[243.68s]  And remember, youth is characterized by relatively lower resting heart rates,
[247.32s]  but also higher heart rate variability.
[249.04s]  Conversely, we can see now that the higher my body weight,
[254.74s]  the lower my heart rate variability,
[256.68s]  significantly lower as shown there by the p-value and the correlation coefficient, little r.
[262.14s]  So this also raises a question, you know,
[263.92s]  what body weight optimizes both resting heart rate and heart rate variability?
[267.62s]  And as we can see for both data,
[270.32s]  somewhere around 151 pounds results or is correlated with my lowest resting heart rate,
[276.02s]  but also my highest heart rate variability.
[277.70s]  So I'm currently around 155 and slowly working towards getting back towards 150, 151,
[283.52s]  and even, you know, lower if I can get there and sustain it.
[287.62s]  Now, note that for a given average daily heart rate,
[290.62s]  having a higher body weight on that day would result in a more daily exertional strain.
[295.50s]  In other words, if my average daily heart rate is 60 beats per minute,
[298.12s]  and I weigh 150 pounds versus weighing 160 pounds,
[301.40s]  because I'm carrying 10 pounds more weight,
[303.10s]  that's an overall greater daily exertion or daily strain
[306.44s]  when compared with only using the average daily heart rate.
[309.92s]  So we can combine both those metrics,
[312.74s]  body weight and the average daily heart rate,
[314.46s]  into a daily strain or a daily exertion metric by multiplying them both
[318.50s]  and then comparing them against resting heart rate and heart rate variability.
[321.88s]  So that's what's shown here.
[323.04s]  So on the y-axis, we've got resting heart rate plotted against this metric of daily exertion or daily strain.
[328.56s]  And we can see that the higher my daily strain,
[330.62s]  that's significantly correlated with a higher next day resting heart rate,
[333.84s]  again, going in the wrong direction.
[335.50s]  And also going in the wrong direction with a higher daily exertion or a higher daily strain
[339.82s]  is my heart rate variability,
[341.86s]  where we can also see significantly lower HRV for a higher daily strain or daily exertion.
[347.94s]  So let's put that data aside for now.
[351.00s]  We'll come back to it in a minute.
[352.22s]  I'm going to show some data where we adjust our models for this exertion metric,
[356.40s]  but also with some dietary variables.
[358.82s]  So shifting over to diet,
[360.20s]  how does diet correlate with resting heart rate and heart rate variability?
[363.74s]  So the first obvious metric for diet would be calorie intake.
[368.66s]  And that's what's plotted here.
[369.96s]  So we've got resting heart rate on the y-axis plotting as my daily calorie intake.
[373.78s]  And for those who don't know, I've been weighing all my food since 2015
[376.14s]  and then tracking it and logging it into an Excel file.
[379.42s]  So I have lots of dietary data over the past three plus years
[382.52s]  that I've been tracking my fitness metrics,
[384.20s]  as we can see by almost 1200 days of data.
[386.90s]  So now we can see the strongest data of all the data I presented so far.
[390.46s]  The higher my calorie intake,
[392.20s]  that's significantly correlated with a higher resting heart rate.
[396.06s]  And also conversely,
[397.56s]  a higher calorie intake is significantly correlated with a lower heart rate variability.
[402.10s]  So when considering all the data I just presented,
[404.34s]  this suggests that physical activity, body weight, and calorie intake
[407.40s]  can be specifically titrated to optimize both resting heart rate and heart rate variability.
[412.12s]  And I'll go more into depth in future videos
[413.80s]  to actually see what may be optimal for me.
[417.18s]  Now, more specifically in terms of diet,
[419.62s]  what about diet composition?
[420.96s]  Just calorie intake says nothing about whether it's higher fat,
[423.82s]  higher carbs, higher fiber, et cetera.
[425.84s]  So what about correlations and associations for diet composition with these metrics?
[430.18s]  So first, I'm going to present the data for heart rate variability with dietary macronutrients
[435.10s]  because the strongest associations were present for that
[438.42s]  with lesser but still significant associations for resting heart rate,
[441.84s]  which I'll show next.
[443.20s]  Now, note that in previous videos,
[445.04s]  although I've shown unadjusted correlations between diet with blood-based biomarkers,
[449.34s]  in this case, when considering that we know that physical activity,
[452.48s]  body weight, and also calorie intake
[453.96s]  are significantly associated with resting heart rate and heart rate variability,
[457.24s]  they should be in any model that looks at potential associations
[461.26s]  or significant associations for macronutrients with these metrics.
[465.94s]  So in this case, I created linear regression models
[469.04s]  that were adjusted for or that included daily exertion,
[472.44s]  so that body weight times average daily heart rate,
[474.88s]  and also calorie intake,
[476.32s]  and then also each individual macronutrient.
[480.14s]  So there are eight different models.
[482.12s]  Each of them have these daily exertion and calorie intake variables,
[485.72s]  but then each of the respective macronutrients.
[489.50s]  And note that daily exertion and calorie intake on their own,
[493.70s]  when associated with heart rate variability,
[496.16s]  account for a small but significant amount of the variance in HRV,
[499.66s]  so 5.7%.
[500.78s]  Now, that may not seem like much,
[502.30s]  especially when we look at how that relates to resting heart rate.
[505.66s]  We'll see that daily exertion and calorie intake
[507.22s]  actually explain more of the variance in resting heart rate,
[510.08s]  but it's 6%, you know, and the data is what it is.
[513.36s]  All right, so what's the data for macronutrients
[516.08s]  and how they relate to heart rate variability
[517.72s]  after adjusting for daily exertion and calorie intake?
[520.04s]  That's what's shown here.
[521.32s]  The N, starting on the left, it's 593 days of data.
[526.48s]  So there's a lot to unpack here.
[528.00s]  Let's just walk through it step by step.
[529.56s]  So in terms of macronutrients,
[531.14s]  I looked at carbohydrates,
[532.88s]  and I split carbohydrates into two different fractions,
[535.72s]  non-fructose carbohydrates and fructose.
[538.02s]  So I've been tracking both of those, you know, since 2015,
[541.00s]  so I have data for that, each of the fatty acids,
[543.90s]  so monounsaturated, MUFA, omega-3, omega-6,
[546.56s]  saturated fatty acids, SFA,
[548.24s]  and then also protein and fiber intake.
[550.36s]  And then we've got the beta coefficient,
[551.94s]  plus or minus the standard error.
[553.24s]  So that's, you know, are these macronutrients
[555.56s]  associated with higher or lower HRV?
[559.12s]  The P value for whether those associations
[560.80s]  are statistically significant.
[562.44s]  The significance F, so whether or not,
[565.56s]  in this case, they are,
[566.86s]  whether each of these linear regression models,
[569.26s]  the eight different models for the eight different macronutrients
[571.44s]  after adjusting for exertion and calorie intake
[573.68s]  are significantly associated with HRV.
[575.58s]  And as we can see, they're all less than 0.05,
[577.90s]  so they're all statistically significant.
[579.88s]  The adjusted R-squared,
[580.90s]  how much of the variance is explained in total
[583.42s]  by the three variables.
[585.30s]  The percent explained relative to the base model,
[587.78s]  so how much additional variance in HRV
[589.94s]  is explained by the addition
[591.16s]  of each of the respective macronutrients.
[593.28s]  And then average daily intake,
[594.58s]  which we can use to guide
[596.46s]  how much or how little of these foods
[598.86s]  may be able to optimize heart rate variability.
[601.68s]  And in the next slide, resting heart rate.
[604.32s]  So what's significantly associated with higher HRV?
[607.32s]  And in this case, we can see
[608.40s]  monounsaturated fatty acids, omega-6,
[610.68s]  and protein intake.
[612.26s]  Now, how much additional variance in HRV
[615.00s]  do they explain?
[615.72s]  Now, it may not seem like much
[617.08s]  as protein, for example,
[618.80s]  seems to contribute or contributes
[620.32s]  the most explanatory,
[622.16s]  you know, 2.5%.
[624.78s]  In addition, it explains an additional 2.5%
[627.30s]  in addition to the 5.7%
[628.94s]  that daily exertion and calorie intake
[630.72s]  explained in HRV.
[632.02s]  And then relatively smaller amounts
[633.42s]  is explained by the addition of,
[635.18s]  by the association for omega-6
[636.76s]  and monounsaturated fatty acids.
[639.20s]  All right, so then in terms of nutrients
[640.52s]  that were associated with lower HRV,
[642.90s]  fructose, higher fructose,
[644.64s]  lower HRV,
[645.88s]  saturated fatty acids,
[647.82s]  higher saturated fatty acids,
[649.00s]  lower HRV,
[649.48s]  and then also higher fiber,
[650.76s]  lower HRV.
[652.16s]  And in terms of how much additional
[653.78s]  percentage of the variance in HRV
[656.38s]  that they explain,
[657.40s]  the strongest negative,
[659.22s]  you know, strongest contributor
[660.14s]  was fiber,
[661.02s]  explaining an additional 2.1%,
[663.64s]  bringing the total for that model
[665.30s]  up to 7.8%.
[666.40s]  And then with lesser amounts
[667.92s]  for saturated fatty acids,
[669.44s]  1.1%,
[670.74s]  and fructose, 0.8%.
[672.54s]  And also note that although
[674.74s]  non-fructose carbohydrates
[675.92s]  were very close to statistical significance,
[678.28s]  0.06,
[678.98s]  it's technically not statistically significant,
[682.16s]  and then omega-3 intake
[683.16s]  is not statistically,
[684.60s]  significantly associated with HRV.
[687.20s]  So that summarizes the data
[689.10s]  that I just presented,
[690.00s]  which then raises the interesting question,
[691.94s]  can diet be personalized,
[693.62s]  can this diet be personalized
[694.98s]  to optimize next day heart rate variability
[697.34s]  after a workout?
[698.10s]  So when considering my average daily intake data,
[702.08s]  assuming for a typical amount of calories
[704.34s]  on a workout day,
[706.34s]  and looking at my average daily intake
[708.20s]  for each of these blue and,
[709.64s]  sorry, green and red macronutrients,
[711.76s]  this suggests that eating
[712.96s]  more than 20 grams per day
[714.22s]  of monounsaturated fatty acids,
[715.82s]  more than 11 grams per day of omega-6,
[718.24s]  more than 120 grams of protein,
[720.30s]  but then correspondingly
[721.30s]  less than 79 grams per day for fructose,
[723.98s]  less than 38 grams per day
[725.36s]  for saturated fatty acids,
[726.54s]  and less than 91 grams per day for fiber
[729.44s]  may optimize my next day of HRV.
[731.68s]  And I intend on,
[732.82s]  you know,
[733.40s]  following this path
[734.42s]  and then reevaluating my data
[736.06s]  at a future point
[736.88s]  to see if it actually
[738.14s]  is still strongly
[739.54s]  or significantly correlated with HRV.
[741.98s]  All right,
[742.22s]  so what about the data
[742.82s]  for resting heart rate?
[743.94s]  And as you can see by the title,
[745.32s]  there are weaker
[745.88s]  but statistically significant associations
[747.64s]  for these dietary components
[749.04s]  with resting heart rate.
[750.46s]  So note that
[751.76s]  whereas the combination
[753.30s]  of daily exertion
[754.30s]  and calorie intake
[755.18s]  accounted for 5.7
[756.74s]  of the variants
[757.70s]  explained in heart rate variability,
[759.96s]  which is relatively small,
[761.16s]  now those two variables
[762.26s]  explain a much larger amount
[763.58s]  of the variants
[764.08s]  in resting heart rate,
[764.82s]  44.4%.
[766.14s]  All right,
[767.24s]  so what's significantly associated
[768.44s]  with lower resting heart rate?
[770.60s]  So going in the right direction,
[771.46s]  and again,
[772.12s]  we can see higher
[773.12s]  monounsaturated fatty acids
[774.72s]  and higher omega-6
[775.72s]  is correlated,
[777.16s]  associated after adjusting
[778.46s]  for daily exertion
[779.36s]  and calorie intake
[780.12s]  are associated
[781.38s]  with lower HRV
[782.48s]  and they were also associated
[783.86s]  with high,
[784.46s]  sorry,
[785.00s]  lower resting heart rate
[786.10s]  and they were also associated
[787.08s]  with higher HRV.
[788.90s]  And then in terms
[789.80s]  of the percentage
[790.56s]  that is explained
[791.70s]  by these macronutrients
[793.44s]  relative to the base model,
[795.08s]  note that these
[795.68s]  are relatively smaller effects
[796.80s]  with the exception
[797.32s]  of monounsaturated fatty acids
[798.70s]  as it explains
[800.08s]  an additional 1.3%
[801.56s]  of the variants
[802.12s]  in resting heart rate,
[803.54s]  but then relatively smaller effects
[805.24s]  for omega-6,
[805.88s]  0.3%,
[806.78s]  you know,
[807.46s]  compared to the
[808.14s]  macronutrient associations
[809.86s]  for heart rate variability,
[810.72s]  these are relatively smaller
[812.26s]  explanations,
[814.20s]  additional explanations
[815.04s]  in resting heart rate.
[816.66s]  All right,
[816.92s]  so in terms of the nutrients
[817.84s]  that are associated
[818.50s]  with higher resting heart rates,
[820.24s]  so carbohydrate intake,
[821.60s]  whether non-fructose
[822.38s]  or fructose,
[823.20s]  and then also higher fiber
[824.38s]  is associated
[824.88s]  with higher resting heart rate.
[827.70s]  And in terms
[828.20s]  of how much they explain
[829.16s]  the additional amount
[831.32s]  of the variance
[832.38s]  explained in resting heart rate,
[833.70s]  again,
[833.98s]  we can see relatively
[834.70s]  small amounts,
[836.08s]  0.4%
[837.00s]  for either
[837.80s]  of the two
[838.20s]  carbohydrate divisions
[839.04s]  and only 0.2%
[840.94s]  additionally explained
[841.74s]  for fiber.
[843.58s]  Now,
[843.94s]  also note
[844.66s]  that omega-3,
[845.72s]  saturated fatty acids,
[846.76s]  and protein
[847.16s]  were not significantly
[847.88s]  associated with
[848.76s]  resting heart rate.
[850.06s]  Now,
[850.54s]  this diet,
[852.04s]  you know,
[852.24s]  having relatively
[853.18s]  higher levels
[853.80s]  of amufa
[854.54s]  and omega-6,
[855.30s]  but lower carbohydrate
[856.16s]  and fiber intake,
[858.32s]  this would suggest
[859.00s]  that I could potentially
[859.66s]  increase my
[860.48s]  heart rate variability
[861.60s]  and resting heart rate
[862.48s]  to a much lesser degree,
[864.36s]  but will optimizing
[866.56s]  or getting as much
[868.18s]  bang for my buck
[868.90s]  through diet
[869.50s]  and its impact
[870.84s]  on cardiovascular-related
[872.92s]  metrics,
[873.36s]  is that good
[874.04s]  for my overall
[875.12s]  systemic health
[875.82s]  in terms of
[876.82s]  big-picture
[877.70s]  biomarkers
[878.22s]  that I presented
[878.70s]  in other videos.
[879.74s]  In other words,
[880.24s]  do I optimize
[880.82s]  CV metrics
[881.44s]  but then make
[882.10s]  the net effect
[883.02s]  worse on my
[883.94s]  overall health?
[884.60s]  So,
[885.04s]  I haven't
[885.38s]  investigated that.
[886.26s]  Once I do that analysis,
[887.56s]  I'll present that data
[888.38s]  in another video,
[889.52s]  so stay tuned
[890.50s]  for that data.
[891.56s]  Alright,
[891.86s]  if you're interested
[892.28s]  in more about my
[893.02s]  attempts to biohack aging,
[894.18s]  including daily data
[894.96s]  for resting heart rate
[895.98s]  and heart rate variability,
[897.28s]  and my daily
[898.10s]  dietary data,

[900.56s]  Thanks for watching.
[901.48s]  I hope that you
