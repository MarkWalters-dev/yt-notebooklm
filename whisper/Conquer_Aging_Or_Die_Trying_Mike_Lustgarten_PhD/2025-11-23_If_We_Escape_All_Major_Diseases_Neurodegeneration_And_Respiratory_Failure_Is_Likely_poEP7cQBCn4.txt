[0.40s]  Hey everyone, Maria Brañas Morera, as shown here, lived to 117 years old, which is good
[7.28s]  news because it's pretty close to the longevity world record of 122 years old.
[12.32s]  Now as a part of her story, she escaped the major age-related diseases, including cardiovascular
[17.60s]  disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's, which then raises the question, what was the
[23.80s]  cause of death?
[24.80s]  Now in this video, I'm going to pitch the hypothesis that it could involve respiratory
[29.24s]  failure.
[30.24s]  And note that I'm not the first person to pitch this hypothesis.
[33.28s]  Tony at the I Am Longevity channel, and I'd encourage everyone to check out this video,
[37.40s]  it's a brilliant video, Tony pitched the hypothesis that her cause of death may be linked to a
[42.12s]  loss of motor units in her diaphragm, and then she died in her sleep because she couldn't
[47.44s]  breathe anymore.
[48.44s]  So this is a brilliant hypothesis, and I'm not here to mostly rehash that story, I'm here
[52.92s]  to potentially add to it.
[54.56s]  Let's do a quick review for how a loss of motor units, specifically to the diaphragm, may
[59.06s]  impact respiratory failure.
[61.06s]  So first, during aging there is a loss of motor units, which is what we'll see here.
[66.30s]  On the Y-axis we've got the number of motor units, and this is in a muscle located in the
[71.22s]  upper portion of the foot, plotted against age from birth to around 100 years.
[76.24s]  And we can see that the number of motor units are approximately stable until around 55 years
[81.10s]  old, after which there's a steep decline until 100 years old.
[85.06s]  Now the importance of that, for why motor units are important, is that without motor units telling
[90.22s]  the muscle to contract, it will decay.
[92.30s]  And this is sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and function.
[96.70s]  As Tony so brilliantly says, and states on his channel over and over, that motor units,
[101.26s]  without motor units innervating muscle, we're all screwed.
[104.30s]  We can escape cardiovascular disease, cancer, etc.
[107.30s]  But if we don't have motor units, how can we move, how can we breathe?
[110.86s]  So to illustrate how motor units contribute to muscle contraction, that's what we'll see
[114.68s]  here.
[115.68s]  So the signal for contraction starts in the brain, with upper motor neurons.
[120.16s]  And then the signal from the upper motor neurons is transmitted to the spinal cord, which
[124.12s]  then transmits the signal via lower motor neurons to skeletal muscle, which then tells
[128.94s]  the muscle to contract.
[130.98s]  How does motor unit loss impact respiratory failure?
[134.60s]  So the diaphragm, just like skeletal muscle, is a skeletal muscle, as we can see that it's
[138.86s]  attached to the rib cage.
[140.38s]  So muscle attached to bone is a skeletal muscle.
[143.28s]  And the diaphragm is the main muscle of inspiration.
[146.90s]  We can also see that the diaphragm is innervated, or connected to the spinal cord, by phrenic nerves.
[152.92s]  Now phrenic motor neuron numbers decline during aging, which is what we'll see here.
[158.16s]  The number of phrenic motor neurons on the y-axis plotted against age in young and old
[163.48s]  rats.
[163.78s]  And I should mention the data that I'm going to show, the mechanistic data is in rats and
[168.34s]  mice.
[168.62s]  It's obviously easier to isolate motor units and motor neurons from animal models as we
[174.04s]  can sacrifice and remove the tissues.
[176.28s]  This is infinitely harder in people.
[178.30s]  So I'm going to show data in animal model.
[179.90s]  We can see that the older rats have significantly lower levels of phrenic motor neuron levels when
[185.36s]  compared with young.
[186.08s]  Now the consequence of this is that diaphragm muscle mass and function also decline during
[191.46s]  aging.
[192.46s]  First starting off with the data for diaphragm muscle mass, which is what we'll see here.
[196.16s]  On the y-axis we've got mean or average cross-sectional area.
[199.52s]  And these data are in mice, from young mice, 6 months old, to old mice, 24 months old, in black.
[206.12s]  And then on the x-axis we've got muscle fiber type.
[209.02s]  Type 1, Type 2a, Type 2x, and or Type 2b.
[212.90s]  The importance of these muscle fiber types is that the Type 1 muscles are slow twitch.
[217.28s]  And then from Type 2a and beyond to the right, there's a continuum of faster and then fastest
[223.18s]  twitch muscle fibers.
[224.78s]  So what we can see is that in the Type 1 and Type 2a's there's a trend for lower levels
[229.28s]  of diaphragm muscle mass in the old mice relative to the young.
[232.28s]  But these data are not significant.
[234.28s]  But what we can see is that diaphragm muscle mass is significantly reduced in the older
[239.66s]  mice when compared with the younger mice, specific to the Type 2x and or Type 2b muscle fibers.
[245.28s]  These are the fastest twitch muscle fibers.
[247.66s]  Now, correspondingly with a loss of diaphragm muscle mass, there's also a loss of diaphragm
[252.60s]  muscle function during aging.
[253.84s]  So on the y-axis we've got specific force.
[256.52s]  So this is force production normalized to muscle cross-sectional area.
[260.18s]  And then we've got two different force production measures.
[262.94s]  On the left we've got isometric and on the right we've got tetanic.
[266.72s]  So movement versus no movement and force production.
[269.46s]  What we can see from both force production measures is that the older diaphragms, the
[274.60s]  24-month-old mice, have significantly reduced force production relative to the young mice.
[280.16s]  So taken together, these data do indeed suggest the hypothesis that diaphragm motor unit loss,
[285.68s]  thereby resulting in reduced diaphragm muscle mass and function, could be a cause of death
[290.18s]  in supercentenarians.
[291.94s]  And as I mentioned, Tony beautifully laid out this hypothesis with data, so if you're
[295.82s]  interested in that, I'd recommend checking out his video.
[298.98s]  But I'd like to add, I think I can add to this story.
[302.20s]  And what I think I can add is that if we escape all major diseases, this may not be an
[306.54s]  aberration to Maria, this may be coming for all of us, because neurodegeneration and respiratory
[312.10s]  failure may be a likely cause of death.
[314.60s]  And to illustrate that story, I'm going to look at data for ALS, or amyotrophic lateral
[319.34s]  sclerosis, with the best example of that being Stephen Hawking, as shown here, who was diagnosed
[325.26s]  with and lived with ALS for about 55 years, which is like a crazy record that anybody could
[330.00s]  live with ALS for that long, because it's generally a quick neurodegenerative process and a relatively
[335.14s]  quick death.
[336.64s]  Now you could say the lifetime probability of contracting or getting ALS is low.
[341.52s]  It's one out of every 347 men, and one out of every 436 women are diagnosed with ALS over
[348.62s]  their lifetimes.
[349.84s]  So this doesn't look like an age-related disease on its surface, as everybody isn't
[353.98s]  getting ALS.
[356.00s]  So then how would ALS, or how does ALS link with aging, especially death via respiratory
[361.34s]  failure?
[362.50s]  So first, there are many ALS mechanisms that overlap with hallmarks of aging, which is what
[367.58s]  we'll see here, including disruption of proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress,
[373.84s]  and neuroinflammation.
[376.00s]  Respiratory failure is the top cause of death in ALS, which is what we'll see here.
[381.18s]  So the top cause of death in ALS is not cancer or type 2 diabetes or cardiac arrest or having
[387.48s]  a heart attack or cardiovascular disease.
[389.86s]  We can see that it's respiratory failure.
[392.44s]  So then even without an ALS diagnosis, if we escape all major diseases, neurodegeneration
[397.70s]  and respiratory failure is a likely cause of death.
[400.26s]  To illustrate that point, let's take a look at which biomarkers are linked with neurodegeneration.
[404.86s]  So neurofilament light chain, which I'm going to refer to as NFL, is a biomarker of axonal
[411.44s]  injury, which precedes neurodegeneration, which is what we'll see here in this image of a neuron.
[416.64s]  So when there is injury to the axon, as shown there, neurofilaments are released, which can
[422.08s]  then be detected in the blood as a biomarker of neurodegeneration.
[425.92s]  Now, serum levels of NFL are two times higher in ALS patients when compared with controls.
[432.08s]  That's what we'll see here.
[433.56s]  On the y-axis, we've got serum levels of NFL, and that's plotted against controls on the
[439.76s]  left and ALS, people who are diagnosed with ALS on the right.
[442.64s]  And you can see that these are relatively young subjects, 68 years for the controls and 58
[447.28s]  years for the ALS patients.
[448.80s]  And what we can see is that twofold higher level average level of serum levels of NFL in
[455.16s]  the ALS patients when compared with controls.
[457.84s]  With average levels in the controls, just around 20 picograms per mil, and we can see it's approximately
[462.48s]  double that in the ALS patients.
[464.60s]  Now, what I'd also like to highlight is the highest levels of NFL in the ALS patients,
[469.94s]  which are around, in two patients, around 110 picograms per mil.
[473.74s]  So keep these data in mind, 20, 40, and 110.
[477.84s]  So I mentioned that even without an ALS diagnosis, and I'm going to say this a few times, if we escape
[483.00s]  all major diseases, neurodegeneration and respiratory failure is a likely cause of death.
[486.68s]  So why is that?
[487.68s]  Well, NFL increases during aging, which is what we'll see here.
[492.00s]  And I'm going to use two studies to illustrate this point, but there are many that show an
[496.16s]  age-related increase for serum levels or circulating levels in blood for NFL.
[501.12s]  On the y-axis, we've got serum levels of neurofilament light chain, or NFL, and that's plotted
[505.92s]  against age.
[507.24s]  And then when looking at the median levels of NFL during aging, the yellow line, we can see
[511.86s]  that there's an age-related increase.
[514.06s]  At younger ages, we can see that values for NFL, and these are in non-ALS patients.
[518.66s]  These are in generally healthy population, not ALS patients.
[522.44s]  So we can see that in the generally healthy population in young people, serum NFL levels
[527.08s]  are generally low.
[528.08s]  Even at the upper end of the range, they're around eight or so picograms per mil, which
[531.96s]  is a very low level.
[533.52s]  But then in 65-year-olds, we can see that the highest level of NFL is higher, somewhere
[539.14s]  around 25 picograms per mil.
[541.34s]  Still not as high as what we find in ALS, average values.
[545.34s]  But nonetheless, you can see that the data moves in the wrong direction.
[548.74s]  What I also didn't indicate is that the median levels in this study of up to 65-year-olds
[553.34s]  was 10 picograms per mil in the 65-year-olds.
[556.54s]  So again, this is lower than what we'd expect to find in ALS.
[560.24s]  Note that the study only goes up to 65-year-olds.
[562.66s]  The name of this channel is Conquer Aging or Die Trying, not Get to 65 and Die, right?
[566.82s]  It's super longevity.
[567.94s]  I'm sure many of you watching are interested in super longevity, just like me.
[571.80s]  Which then raises the question, what is the predicted NFL for people greater than 100
[576.62s]  years?
[577.62s]  So the plot shown here is not a linear model, but they did have a linear model in this paper.
[583.02s]  When looking at the linear model, the linear regression equation for how NFL would be predicted
[587.48s]  to change during aging within the 20-65 year age range for the people in this study, if
[592.84s]  we know age and sex, so male or female, we can come close to predicting circulating levels
[598.54s]  of NFL.
[599.54s]  Now, I get that this regression equation is trained based on data up to 65 years.
[605.26s]  So the data I'm going to show now is extrapolation beyond that, which may lose accuracy.
[609.84s]  So this is speculative.
[610.84s]  I want to be very clear.
[612.34s]  This is not definitive.
[613.34s]  This is speculative.
[614.22s]  Ideally, we'd have a population that includes people way up to 120 years, everybody quantifying
[619.54s]  NFL.
[620.54s]  Then we can look at the regression equation and then we can see what it would truly be.
[624.12s]  That data doesn't exist as far as I know.
[626.92s]  So in terms of the average NFL in a 106-year-old when plugging in 106 for age and one for a man,
[633.62s]  and you can enter these data if you're a woman, it should be similar or in the same ballpark.
[638.12s]  The average NFL for a 106-year-old using this equation would be 40 picograms per mil, which
[643.34s]  is the average ALS value.
[644.88s]  Now, would that result in neurodegeneration to the point where we would die in our sleep
[649.66s]  from respiratory failure?
[650.62s]  I'm not sure.
[651.62s]  But that 106-year-olds could have NFL levels as high as the average value found in ALS,
[657.62s]  this is potentially bad news for neurodegeneration at very old ages.
[661.78s]  So let's take this a step further.
[663.58s]  Let's assume that we break the human longevity record of 122 years and get far beyond that,
[668.34s]  say 148 years or around 150.
[671.20s]  Well, when plugging that number into the regression equation, the NFL, the average NFL level would
[676.28s]  be 110 picograms per mil, which is close to the highest value found in ALS.
[681.00s]  Now, would that reproduce full-blown ALS where we'd have to be in a wheelchair for life?
[686.16s]  I don't know.
[687.48s]  But it can't be good for neurodegeneration and the ability to breathe via innervation,
[692.12s]  you know, a loss of motor units.
[694.36s]  So this is just one study.
[695.62s]  Let's see if other studies come to a similar conclusion or not.
[699.12s]  So that's what we'll see here.
[700.38s]  On the y-axis, we've got again NFL plotted against age, and now the age range goes up to
[704.92s]  85 years.
[706.64s]  Well, we can see again that NFL increases during aging, with average values in the 85-year-olds
[711.94s]  around 25 picograms per mil.
[714.58s]  Now again, that's not 40 picograms per mil, but note that these data only go up to 85 years,
[720.72s]  which then raises the question, what is the predicted NFL for people older than 100 years?
[726.20s]  So here too, fortunately, they included a regression equation, and for their regression equation,
[731.76s]  it didn't include sex, so male or female, but it did include age.
[735.24s]  So if we know age, we can predict NFL levels.
[738.44s]  And again, note that these data should be most precise or close to precise within the 20 to
[743.98s]  85-year age range.
[745.30s]  Again, what I'm doing is extrapolation and speculation beyond that range, so the regression equation
[750.68s]  may not completely hold.
[752.20s]  So it's just a ballpark figure, but it could be close to accurate.
[756.74s]  So when entering data for 104 years old, average NFL levels using the regression equation
[762.44s]  would be 40 picograms per mil, again, the average value found in ALS patients, potentially without
[768.64s]  an ALS diagnosis.
[770.40s]  And these data are similar to the values that we saw in the study on the left, 106 years
[774.60s]  old, to get to values that are close to average for what's found in ALS patients.
[779.64s]  All right, what about going beyond 104 years, quote unquote, super longevity?
[783.64s]  Well, if we can get to 135 years, NFL levels based on this regression equation, the study
[789.70s]  on the right, would be 110 picograms per mil.
[792.40s]  Again, this is the highest level that was shown for NFL levels in ALS patients.
[797.56s]  This can't be good for neurodegeneration status at very old ages, which then goes back to this
[803.54s]  initial premise of even without an ALS diagnosis, if we escape all major diseases, neurodegeneration
[810.16s]  and respiratory failure may be a cause of death for those of us who are interested in not just
[815.84s]  longevity, but super longevity.
[817.92s]  All right, so this is the story of what is, but what can we do about it?
[822.92s]  Can we track neurofilament light chain?
[825.52s]  And we can.
[826.52s]  This is ultalabtest.com.
[828.36s]  They do include this biomarker.
[829.76s]  I'm not sure if other blood testing companies include it, but it's pretty expensive.
[833.52s]  For just one biomarker, $637 per test.
[837.42s]  And for someone like me, who's already spending somewhere in that ballpark eight times per
[840.98s]  year, this prices me out.
[842.72s]  Now I'd like to pitch an idea.
[845.04s]  I can do this test, but I can't afford to do it on my own.
[848.10s]  If the community, if all of you would like to crowd fund this, I'd be happy to measure
[852.46s]  this with each of my eight blood tests per year.
[854.60s]  And then at the end of that year, report back on aspects of diet that may be correlated
[859.18s]  with neurofilament light chain.
[860.52s]  So to potentially get that process started, I'll put in the pinned comment.
[865.10s]  But if we get a lot of upvotes, maybe I'll make a crowdfunding where we can crowd fund
[869.88s]  this and I'd be happy to include this for every blood test going forward.
[872.88s]  If not, no worries.
[874.04s]  There may be another way to track neurofilament light chain levels.
[877.92s]  And that's by looking at diacylglycerides or diglycerides, not triglycerides.
[883.38s]  Triglycerides are a glycerol backbone bound to three fatty acids.
[887.68s]  Diglycerides are a glycerol backbone bound to two fatty acids.
[890.60s]  And diglycerides have been shown to be significantly associated with circulating levels of NFL,
[895.20s]  at least in ALS patients.
[897.60s]  With the strongest association between those two diglycerides on the Y axis plotted against
[902.74s]  NFL on the X in ALS patients for the diglyceride that has oleic acid, 18,1 colon 18,1.
[911.16s]  So what we can see from this plot is that this diglyceride that contains oleic acid is significantly
[915.92s]  correlated with circulating levels of NFL in ALS patients.
[920.40s]  In other words, when this diglyceride is higher, that was significantly correlated or
[924.56s]  associated with higher levels of NFL.
[927.30s]  And when levels of these diglycerides were lower, levels of NFL were correspondingly lower.
[931.94s]  Again, these are correlations.
[933.18s]  This is not causation.
[934.28s]  I just want to make that point abundantly clear.
[937.28s]  Now in this study, this wasn't the only diglyceride that was associated significantly
[941.16s]  associated with NFL.
[943.12s]  There were others, six others as shown here.
[946.38s]  So on the left, we've got those specific diglyceride species.
[950.24s]  And then we can see when looking at their adjusted p-values, each had an adjusted p-value less
[954.94s]  than 0.05.
[956.44s]  So they were higher in ALS patients when compared with healthy controls.
[960.70s]  In terms of how much higher, we'll take a look at the log FC.
[964.04s]  That's the log two-fold change value.
[966.62s]  Now for those who may be unfamiliar with statistics, on its face, it may look like the DG181, 18,1,
[972.12s]  is 4.2-fold higher in ALS patients when compared with controls.
[977.38s]  But no, this is a log scale.
[979.38s]  This is a base two log scale.
[983.06s]  So that's actually 18 times higher in the ALS patients when compared with the healthy controls.
[987.88s]  And we're looking at the log two FC value for the lowest log FC value, which was 2.62.
[994.24s]  That's six times higher in the ALS patients when compared with the healthy controls.
[998.88s]  So for the seven diglycerides that are on this list, they were six to 18 times higher
[1003.64s]  in ALS patients when compared with healthy controls.
[1006.14s]  And one of them is significantly correlated with neurofilament light chain.
[1009.82s]  These diglycerides can be tracked, which means they can potentially optimize.
[1013.82s]  Now, will that slow neurodegeneration?
[1015.82s]  I don't know.
[1016.82s]  But for someone like me who's interested in super longevity, if I can keep diglycerides low,
[1021.68s]  and that's a part of any mechanisms that are involved in keeping NFL low, I'm going to do that.
[1026.36s]  To track diglycerides, I've been using at-home metabolomics using IOLO's kit as shown here,
[1031.40s]  which includes data for ALS-associated diglycerides, but also 600 other metabolites.
[1037.26s]  Now, I prefer the raw data from IOLO, but there may be others who prefer data grouped into categories.
[1042.60s]  And IOLO also does that as shown here by grouping the data into 19 categories.
[1046.82s]  So if you want to use this kit, discount link in the video's description.
[1050.50s]  All right, so what's my data for these ALS-associated diglycerides?
[1054.46s]  First though, which of these ALS-associated diglycerides can be tracked?
[1059.06s]  So of the seven that were on the list, IOLO's kit includes four of them, including DG18118-1,
[1065.30s]  which had the strongest correlation of those seven diglycerides with NFL.
[1070.40s]  Now, to quantify this over time, I think it makes sense to sum levels of these four,
[1076.16s]  if we had all seven diglycerides, it would be even better.
[1078.84s]  But to sum levels of these four diglycerides, when considering that they're all higher in ALS
[1083.36s]  in association with neurodegeneration, to sum them and track year-to-year change
[1087.52s]  and try to keep year-to-year change as low as possible.
[1090.26s]  So that's what we'll see here.
[1091.38s]  With the sum of these four ALS-associated diglycerides on the Y-axis plotted against time
[1096.90s]  from 2023 to 2025, as I have 20 tests over that period.
[1101.04s]  I have test number 21.
[1102.46s]  I'm waiting on those data.
[1103.86s]  So when I first started tracking over five tests in 2023, average levels of these four
[1108.36s]  diglycerides, 4.1 micromolar.
[1111.26s]  In 2024, over nine tests, a bit better at 3.7 micromolar.
[1115.90s]  And thus far, after the first six tests in 2025, again, I'm waiting on results for test number
[1121.34s]  seven and I'm going to send another for test number eight.
[1123.68s]  So we'll have a bit more data.
[1125.38s]  Average diglyceride levels for these four, 3.9 micromolar.
[1128.80s]  In terms of what's optimal, very debatable.
[1132.12s]  At worst, I'd say lower is better, especially when considering that higher levels of diglycerides
[1136.82s]  are associated with higher levels of neurofilament light chain.
[1140.68s]  But how low?
[1141.58s]  Nobody knows.
[1142.70s]  So I'm aiming for my lowest levels.
[1144.70s]  And then on the other side, resisting an age-related increase, especially if higher levels are involved
[1149.52s]  in mechanisms related to neurodegeneration.
[1152.30s]  Now, as a side note, if you're familiar with the channel, diglycerides shouldn't be a new
[1156.14s]  topic.
[1156.70s]  They shouldn't be a new metabolite species.
[1158.16s]  They're associated with all-cause or an increased all-cause mortality risk.
[1162.40s]  And if you missed that video, I'll link to it in the right corner.
[1165.48s]  So these data then raise a few questions.
[1168.34s]  Which interventions reduce NFL and or diglycerides?
[1171.98s]  Now, the obvious would be exercise training.
[1174.10s]  Because if we regularly exercise, we'd expect to have more motor units or slow the loss of
[1179.00s]  motor units during aging.
[1180.92s]  Neurodegeneration would be a part of that process.
[1182.66s]  So exercise training potentially slowing the neurodegeneration, potentially slowing circulating
[1187.58s]  levels of NFL, potentially having lower levels of diglycerides.
[1190.76s]  That seems like the obvious story.
[1192.46s]  But there may be other mechanisms.
[1194.12s]  So I'm going to do deep dives in future videos.
[1195.96s]  So stay tuned for that.
[1196.88s]  Also, are there other biomarkers related to NFL or neurodegeneration that we can track?
[1203.76s]  NFL may be one measure.
[1205.52s]  But if there are other measures that we can track, either directly that are direct markers
[1209.84s]  of neurodegeneration or indirectly that are associated with NFL or other neurodegeneration biomarkers,
[1215.78s]  that may be wise to track over time.
[1218.74s]  And just as a heads up before making that video, there are some.
[1222.28s]  Cystatin C is linked with NFL, chynurnine divided by tryptophan, and acylcarnitine.
[1227.46s]  If you've ever wondered what's optimal for biomarkers, we'll have a new Patreon tier dedicated
[1231.42s]  specifically to that.
[1232.86s]  It currently includes the 35 biomarkers shown here, more than two hours of video content,
[1237.56s]  52 published references, and these aren't the reference ranges.
[1240.70s]  This is what may be optimal based on how each of these biomarkers changes during aging
[1244.34s]  and or associations with all-cause mortality risk in the largest studies that exist.
[1249.46s]  So if you're interested in that, check it out.
[1252.10s]  If you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging, check us out on Patreon,
[1255.78s]  where I offer blood test consults and also post at least twice per day in four other Patreon
[1261.02s]  tiers.
[1261.80s]  We've also got a whole bunch of discount and affiliate links that you can use to test yourself
[1265.38s]  that help support the channel, including ultalabtest.com, which is where I get the majority
[1269.48s]  of my blood tests done, the clearly filtered water filter, which I use every day,
[1272.90s]  Iola's Metaboloma Kit, as mentioned in the video, oral microbiome composition, NAD testing
[1278.40s]  with Genfinity, epigenetic testing with True Diagnostic, at-home blood testing with Cyfox
[1283.02s]  Health, which includes the best epigenetic tests of epigenetic tests, Grimmage, green tea,
[1288.02s]  which I drink every day, diet tracking with chronometer, or if you'd like to support the channel, you
[1291.74s]  can do that with the website, buy me a coffee.
[1293.86s]  We've also got merch, including Data is My North Star, Figuring Stuff Out is My Drug, which
[1298.66s]  I've got on here, and the Conquer Aging or Dietrying logo, link in the video's description.
[1304.14s]  Thanks for watching.
[1305.24s]  Hope that you enjoyed the video.
[1306.62s]  Have a great day.
