[0.00s]  Beta-hydroxybutyrate impacts many age-related phenotypes.
[4.26s]  But first, what is beta-hydroxybutyrate?
[7.02s]  That's what we'll see here.
[8.18s]  This is its chemical structure.
[9.98s]  And as its name suggests, it includes the short-chain fatty acid butyrate, as shown there.
[15.90s]  And then, to the left of the COOH functional group, it includes three other carbons,
[21.78s]  at the alpha, beta, and gamma positions.
[24.94s]  At the beta position, it has that OH group, or a hydroxyl group.
[29.02s]  So, putting it all together, we've got beta-hydroxybutyrate.
[33.32s]  Alright, so I mentioned that beta-hydroxybutyrate impacts many age-related phenotypes.
[38.02s]  And that's what we'll see here.
[39.68s]  So, beta-hydroxybutyrate has been shown to reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance,
[45.84s]  which collectively have been shown to be good for the brain, heart, fat, muscle, kidney, and the pancreas.
[52.64s]  Additionally, beta-hydroxybutyrate is increased in animal models of longevity,
[57.18s]  which is what we'll start to see here.
[59.64s]  First, starting off with data for mice on a ketogenic diet.
[63.24s]  On the y-axis, we've got beta-hydroxybutyrate circulating levels.
[66.74s]  And apologies that the image is a bit blurry.
[68.98s]  This is a screenshot from the paper.
[70.48s]  And if anyone's interested in the paper, I'll link to it in the video's description.
[74.44s]  And then, on the x-axis, we can see that these mice were relatively old, 26 months.
[78.66s]  And then, we've got three groups.
[80.62s]  C for the control diet, LC for low-carb.
[83.32s]  And as we'll see in a minute, that was actually high-fat, just not as high-fat as the ketogenic group in K.
[89.84s]  And then, we can see for the ketogenic diet-fed mice,
[92.92s]  they had approximately two-fold higher circulating levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate when controlled with the control diet.
[99.12s]  And that's potentially important because, in this study, a ketogenic diet extended lifespan,
[104.80s]  which is what we'll see here.
[106.08s]  On the y-axis, we've got percent survival plotted against age in days.
[111.10s]  And then, in terms of those three groups, again, there were the control diet, ketogenic, and low-carb.
[116.60s]  More specifically, the control diet was 17% fat, 89% fat for the ketogenic diet,
[122.74s]  and then that low-carb diet, in quotes, was 70% fat.
[126.30s]  Still a relatively high-fat diet, just not as high-fat as the ketogenic-fed diet.
[131.58s]  But note that these were isocaloric diets.
[134.20s]  And that's potentially important because when mice are fed a ketogenic diet, they become obese.
[140.12s]  So, in order to minimize that occurrence, all of the groups were isocaloric,
[144.48s]  meaning they ate the same amount of calories.
[146.88s]  In terms of the effect on lifespan, first, let's put up a red line at 50% survival.
[152.84s]  This is median survival.
[154.56s]  This is the time when half of the mice have died, and half are still alive.
[158.08s]  So, first, at that point, 50% survival for the control diet, we can see that median lifespan was about 900 days.
[165.64s]  And this is good news because in many lifespan studies, the control strain is relatively short-lived, shorter than 900 days.
[172.96s]  And then the intervention may get the animals to 900 days.
[176.56s]  But is that really a lifespan-extending effect if the controls are supposed to have a median lifespan of 900 days?
[183.70s]  So, in this study, it's good news that the controls lived a median of 900 days.
[188.68s]  And then the ketogenic diet significantly increased or pushed lifespan out to the right, with a median lifespan of 1,000 days.
[196.20s]  Here, too, this beats the 900-day rule.
[198.56s]  And if you want more information on the 900-day rule and its importance in lifespan studies in mice, I'll link to that video in the right corner.
[206.74s]  But note that this isn't the only lifespan-extending intervention that also has an increase for circulating levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate.
[213.82s]  That's also present in calorie-restricted mice.
[217.10s]  First, starting off with the data for beta-hydroxybutyrate circulating levels, which is what we've got on the y-axis.
[222.68s]  And then we've got two different diets.
[224.88s]  RD is the regular diet, and CR is calorie-restricted mice.
[229.28s]  And here, too, just like the ketogenic diet-fed mice, we can see that calorie-restricted mice had about a two-fold increase for circulating levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate.
[238.42s]  Now, it's well known that calorie restriction extends lifespan, which is one example as shown here.
[244.38s]  And note that these data aren't from the same study.
[246.62s]  The beta-hydroxybutyrate data is from a different study relative to this CR study that I'm showing here.
[252.90s]  And if anyone's come across a study where they measured both beta-hydroxybutyrate and lifespan in the same study,
[258.58s]  please post it in the comments, and I'd be happy to give you a shout-out in a future video.
[262.60s]  Nonetheless, let's take a look at the lifespan data for calorie-restricted mice.
[266.34s]  On the y-axis, we've got survival probability.
[268.64s]  Once again, percent survival.
[270.44s]  Plotted against age, let's put up that red line at median lifespan, or 50% survival, the time when half of the mice had died and half were still alive.
[278.20s]  And then we've got our two calorie-restricted groups, 20% and 40% CR.
[282.68s]  And we can see those significant increases for lifespan for the first, for the 20% calorie-restricted mice, and then for the 40% calorie-restricted mice.
[290.84s]  But note that these are just associations.
[293.46s]  In other words, we've got data that a ketogenic diet and a calorie-restricted diet extend lifespan in association for circulating levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate.
[302.24s]  Can we get closer to causation?
[304.90s]  In other words, is beta-hydroxybutyrate related to CR's lifespan-extending effect?
[310.20s]  And in order to get closer to answering that question, we need to see that beta-hydroxybutyrate is produced by glucagon signaling, which is what we'll see here.
[317.46s]  So glucagon, starting at the top, binds to its receptor, the GCG, glucagon receptor, R, GCGR, glucagon receptor.
[326.88s]  And when it does that, it triggers an intracellular signaling cascade that leads to the production of beta-hydroxybutyrate.
[333.30s]  And this is particularly important because glucagon signaling is required for the lifespan-extending effect of calorie-restriction, which is what we'll see here.
[340.76s]  On the y-axis, we've got percent survival, and this is plotted against days alive.
[345.80s]  Let's put up that red line at median survival, 50% survival, the time when half the mice have died and half are still alive.
[352.76s]  And then we can see that for one of those groups, all of the mice were still alive.
[357.36s]  And that's calorie restriction, 15% calorie restriction.
[360.10s]  All of the mice were still alive after 550 days.
[363.58s]  And then we can also see for one of those groups that half of the mice had died.
[367.54s]  And this is the GCGR, or the glucagon receptor knockout mice.
[372.58s]  So these are calorie-restricted mice that had their glucagon receptor knocked out.
[376.78s]  And then correspondingly, there should be no intracellular glucagon signaling.
[381.16s]  And within this situation, we'd expect to see no or very low levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate.
[386.52s]  Note that calorie-restricted mice are not on a ketogenic diet, which is known to produce beta-hydroxybutyrate by increasing glucagon levels.
[394.04s]  Calorie-restricted mice, in this case, on a standard high-carb diet, in order for calorie-restricted mice to have higher levels or increased levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate,
[403.86s]  they fast for up to 22 hours a day, eating the majority of their food within a very short window, two hours.
[410.88s]  So then this raises the question of how does beta-hydroxybutyrate vary during that up to 22-hour fast?
[417.48s]  And that's a particularly important question because then it suggests that there may be an optimal fasting window or an optimal fasting duration for mice on a calorie-restricted diet
[427.26s]  to potentially gain some of the health and or longevity promoting benefits of a calorie-restricted diet.
[433.34s]  So to address that, let's take a look at how beta-hydroxybutyrate changes throughout the day in mice on a calorie-restricted diet,
[440.02s]  with circulating levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate on the y-axis.
[442.86s]  And then this is in mice that have just eaten or following mice that had just eaten at 6 in the morning.
[450.00s]  At that time, beta-hydroxybutyrate levels are relatively low, around 0.2 millimolar or 200 micromolar.
[457.20s]  And then for the first 8 hours after fasting, after completing their eating,
[461.82s]  we can see that beta-hydroxybutyrate levels still stay around 0.2 millimolar.
[466.06s]  But then they start to increase 12 hours after fasting, with a peak at 16 hours after fasting.
[473.62s]  At that time, beta-hydroxybutyrate levels are about threefold, or three to three and a half times higher than where they started, around 0.2 millimolar.
[482.82s]  So around 0.6 to 0.7 millimolar relative to around 0.2 millimolar.
[487.58s]  And then interestingly, beta-hydroxybutyrate levels don't stay relatively high as the fasting window continues, up to 20 hours.
[494.88s]  And then we can see actually the beta-hydroxybutyrate levels in blood start to decline.
[499.28s]  But nonetheless, at that point, they're still up 1.5 to 2 times higher than where they started, around 0.2 millimolar.
[506.66s]  So when it comes to the optimal fasting duration in people, if we use the mouse data,
[511.90s]  beta-hydroxybutyrate increases from 12 to 20 hours of fasting, which then raises the question,
[517.82s]  is that an optimal fasting window in people, 12 to 20 hours, in order to get that systemic rise for circulating levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate?
[526.26s]  So to try to find out, I've been tracking it.
[528.86s]  And I'm not going to show data in this video because I have less than a week's worth of data for now,
[532.84s]  but I'm going to collect at least a month of data.
[535.56s]  And I've been using a ketone meter, as shown there.
[537.62s]  I'm not sponsored or affiliated. This is just what I'm using.
[540.52s]  I don't know which one is best.
[542.04s]  This ketone meter does have some publications behind it.
[544.52s]  How well it compares to venipuncture, I'm not sure, but this is what I'm using for now.
[549.74s]  And in doing this experiment, I'm going to see if I can play around with the fasting window,
[553.92s]  going from 16 to 20 hours per day, but then also messing with fat intake.
[559.26s]  Now, I'm not on a ketogenic diet.
[560.92s]  And I know some of you will say, just go keto, cut out all carbs.
[564.22s]  But if you see my biomarkers, that may not necessarily be a good thing.
[569.74s]  Plus, I'm a volume eater.
[571.50s]  So my current iteration of the diet, which contains around 40% fat,
[575.86s]  maybe a bit higher if you include fat that's generated from fiber fermentation.
[579.88s]  That is best for my satiety and long-term calorie restriction adherence.
[585.38s]  But can I go higher for fat intake from 40 to 45%, maybe to 50 or 55%?
[591.78s]  Now, if I do that, one thing to consider is when I've gone higher fat,
[595.36s]  up to about 120 grams per day in the past,
[597.96s]  that's led to an increase for plasma levels of glucose.
[602.00s]  So it doesn't make sense that I want to increase glucose levels,
[604.74s]  but also increase circulating levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate.
[607.74s]  And I know that may seem counterintuitive.
[610.26s]  Cut carbs, increase fat, see a higher levels of glucose.
[614.02s]  But in my case, for whatever reason,
[616.10s]  the correlations suggest that higher levels of saturated fat
[619.48s]  and higher levels actually of what most people think of
[622.34s]  as a quote-unquote hard healthy fat,
[624.34s]  monounsaturated fat is significantly correlated with higher glucose in my data.
[629.14s]  And that's in more than 60 blood tests since 2015.
[632.24s]  So more recently, I haven't increased MUFA or sat fat,
[636.36s]  keeping them relatively low or towards the lower end of my range
[639.56s]  instead of increased omega-6 intake,
[642.40s]  not from seed oils, but exclusively from walnuts.
[645.00s]  So for now, glucose levels are relatively low.
[648.02s]  And last night I saw a trend upwards
[650.42s]  for circulating levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate,
[652.88s]  which suggests that I may be on the right track
[655.10s]  for keeping glucose relatively low
[657.10s]  and getting a small but potentially significant spike
[659.98s]  or increase for beta-hydroxybutyrate
[662.02s]  from around 0.2 millimolar to something higher.
[664.66s]  How much is optimal in people?
[665.94s]  Very debatable.
[666.90s]  But if I can get at least to 0.4 millimolar,
[669.56s]  even that two eggs doubling,
[671.34s]  based on the data in calorie-restricted mice,
[673.44s]  it may be potential for health and or longevity.
[676.44s]  But the key variable there again is,
[678.86s]  what's the impact on other biomarkers?
[680.64s]  I'm not interested in improving glucose,
[683.62s]  beta-hydroxybutyrate,
[684.64s]  and having other biomarkers move in the wrong direction.
[687.76s]  Now, as one note of potential good news,
[690.00s]  more recently in my blood test,
[691.92s]  when I've increased fat intake
[693.12s]  just by about 15 grams per day,
[695.08s]  from 85 to 100 grams per day,
[697.16s]  that may be associated with a better CVD biomarker profile
[700.86s]  as triglycerides come down and lipoprotein A comes down,
[704.34s]  which would be expected to be contributing
[705.90s]  to a lower atherogenic risk.
[708.08s]  But here too, I'm not just interested in improving glucose,
[711.76s]  circulating levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate,
[713.54s]  which is what ketone meters are essentially measuring,
[716.10s]  and then the lipid profile or lipoprotein profile.
[718.74s]  What do other biomarkers show within this context,
[721.56s]  including kidney, liver, immune, red blood cells, et cetera.
[725.42s]  So I'm planning on doing this experiment
[727.14s]  until the next blood test at the beginning of February,
[729.72s]  so stay tuned for that data.
[731.36s]  But then there's also an additional question
[733.52s]  that we may want to consider here.
[734.92s]  Is beta-hydroxybutyrate, is that spike
[737.36s]  in the middle of the night,
[738.86s]  is that optimal for slowing brain aging?
[741.50s]  And the reason I'm raising that question
[742.90s]  is because there's emerging data
[744.54s]  that beta-hydroxybutyrate may improve glymphatic function,
[748.40s]  which is the brain's waste clearance system
[750.96s]  that's active during sleep.
[752.66s]  Those data are just more recently being published,
[755.36s]  so it's an emerging story.
[756.94s]  I don't have a video planned for it yet,
[759.32s]  but that's on the radar,
[760.74s]  so stay tuned for that video
[761.68s]  at some point in the near future.
[763.48s]  If you've ever wondered what's optimal for biomarkers,
[766.86s]  we'll have a new Patreon tier
[768.24s]  dedicated specifically to that.
[770.26s]  It currently includes the 35 biomarkers shown here,
[773.14s]  more than two hours of video content,
[775.18s]  52 published references,
[776.78s]  and these aren't the reference ranges
[778.24s]  which you can get from any LLM these days.
[780.70s]  This is what may be optimal
[781.80s]  based on how each of these biomarkers
[783.40s]  changes during aging
[784.30s]  and or associations with all-cause mortality risk
[787.24s]  in the largest published studies that exist.
[789.92s]  So if you're interested in that, check it out.
