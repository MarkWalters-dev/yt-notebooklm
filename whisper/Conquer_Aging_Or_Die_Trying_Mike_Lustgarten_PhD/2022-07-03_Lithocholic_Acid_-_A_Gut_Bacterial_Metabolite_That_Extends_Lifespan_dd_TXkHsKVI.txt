[0.46s]  Circulating levels of bile acids are elevated in a mouse model of longevity.
[5.00s]  So first, let's have a look at the mouse model of longevity.
[8.04s]  Here's survival data for control animals and lit-lit mice, which are in black circles.
[13.26s]  These are animals that have a mutation in the growth hormone receptor,
[17.52s]  thereby leading to 99% reduced levels of circulating growth hormone.
[22.22s]  So when looking at survival, median survival is indicated by 50% survival.
[26.78s]  This is when half the colony has died, half is still alive.
[30.22s]  And maximum survival, this is 10% survival.
[33.56s]  This is when 90% of the colony has died and only 10% is still alive.
[38.04s]  We can see a significant increase for both median and maximal lifespan in the lit-lit mice,
[43.82s]  which are otherwise known as dwarf mice or little mice.
[47.42s]  So we can see that circulating levels of bile acids, as I've written here,
[50.86s]  are elevated in this mouse model of longevity.
[53.56s]  And we can see that data there.
[54.92s]  So here are seven bile acids as contained in blood for the little mice, for wild-type mice,
[62.38s]  and the ratio between the little mice, the dwarf mice, with wild-type mice.
[66.86s]  And then to the far right is the p-value for whether these amounts are different between groups.
[72.64s]  So what we can see is for all of these bile acids, with the exception of one, alpha-murycholic acid,
[79.02s]  all of them are significantly higher in the dwarf mice when compared with the wild-type mice.
[83.80s]  And not just a little bit higher, but a lot higher,
[87.24s]  ranging from 2.8-fold to 5.4-fold higher in the dwarf mice when compared with wild-type.
[92.88s]  And you can see at the bottom, too, that total levels of these bile acids are 4.2-fold elevated in the dwarf mice
[99.22s]  when compared with the wild-type.
[101.28s]  So from this, we can conclude that circulating bile acids are associated with an increased lifespan.
[106.34s]  Although the primary intervention was the mutation in the growth hormone receptor,
[110.64s]  bile acids, as we can see by this data, are associated with an increased lifespan.
[115.40s]  So what about causation?
[117.06s]  So in an earlier video, we saw that one of these bile acids,
[119.70s]  the primary bile acid, known as cholic acid, was significantly higher in the dwarf mice,
[125.22s]  3.5-fold higher in the dwarf mice when compared with wild-type.
[128.70s]  And cholic acid on its own extends lifespan in a mouse model of accelerated aging,
[133.40s]  which is what we can see here.
[135.28s]  So in this study, they used the ZMP-STE24 knockout mice,
[140.76s]  and this is an accelerated aging model or a mouse model of progeria,
[145.02s]  which is accelerated aging, a genetic model of accelerated aging.
[147.92s]  So they split half these mice into control-fed and cholic acid-fed, CA.
[153.32s]  More specifically, 0.1% cholic acid was supplied in the diet.
[157.40s]  And what we can see by looking at median, so 50% survival and maximum survival,
[162.04s]  which was defined as 20% survival.
[163.98s]  So in this study, it was 80% of the colony had died, only 20% was still alive.
[168.46s]  We can see a significant increase by 7% for median lifespan
[171.58s]  and a borderline significant increase for maximum lifespan,
[175.98s]  with the p-value for maximum lifespan being right at the border.
[179.66s]  P-value equals 0.054.
[182.92s]  So what about other bile acids?
[184.72s]  We see that at least one bile acid can extend lifespan.
[187.74s]  What about other bile acids?
[189.56s]  Can they extend lifespan?
[190.92s]  So I think a good idea is to look at other bile acids on this list
[195.14s]  and to look into the literature to see if any of them have extended lifespan in other animal models.
[201.02s]  More specifically, what about lithocholic acid,
[203.42s]  which was 3.7-fold higher in the dwarf mice when compared with wild type?
[208.90s]  So first, we can see that lithocholic acid extends lifespan in yeast.
[212.80s]  So here we're looking at the percentage of alive cells,
[215.32s]  or alive yeast cells on the Y-axis,
[217.22s]  against days in culture.
[218.94s]  So these are yeast cells grown in cell culture.
[221.82s]  And when looking at the wild type yeast,
[223.78s]  these yeast were not supplied with bile acids.
[226.26s]  So that's the black squares as shown there.
[229.12s]  And when looking at median survival,
[230.58s]  again, 50% survival,
[232.08s]  half the yeast cells have died,
[233.50s]  half are still alive.
[234.72s]  We can see that median survival for the wild type
[237.04s]  non-bile acid supplemented yeast was 12 days.
[240.60s]  Now notice there is a dramatic extension in lifespan,
[243.76s]  shifting the survival curves to the far right.
[245.64s]  And as you guessed it, lithocholic acid.
[248.48s]  So yeast that were supplemented with lithocholic acid,
[251.02s]  you can see there's a dramatic increase in median lifespan up to 30 days.
[255.84s]  So that's a 250-fold increase,
[258.36s]  or 2.5-fold increase for median lifespan
[260.94s]  in lithocholic acid supplemented yeast.
[264.22s]  But note that this is when the yeast cells are grown under 0.2% glucose.
[269.20s]  And these are calorie-restricted conditions,
[271.62s]  as we'll see in a minute.
[272.98s]  So does lithocholic acid extend yeast lifespan without calorie restriction?
[278.52s]  And it does.
[279.40s]  As we can see by the title,
[280.54s]  lithocholic acid extends lifespan and yeast under calorie-restricted
[283.78s]  and non-calorie-restricted conditions.
[285.82s]  So what are we looking at here?
[287.16s]  So we've got lifespan on the Y-axis,
[289.82s]  including both average lifespan on the left
[291.80s]  and maximum lifespan on the right.
[293.64s]  And then we've got the glucose concentration that the yeast cells were exposed to,
[298.42s]  ranging from 0% all the way up to 0.2% glucose,
[302.54s]  all the way up to 2% glucose.
[304.00s]  So 10 times higher than the data that I just showed on the previous slide.
[307.94s]  And then we've got the data for yeast that were not supplemented with lithocholic acid
[313.40s]  in the open white circles,
[315.20s]  and then the yeast that were supplemented with lithocholic acid
[317.88s]  in the black, in the filled circles.
[319.84s]  So when looking at 0.2% glucose,
[322.58s]  the data that I just showed on the previous slide,
[324.56s]  there was that increase in median,
[326.60s]  but also as we can see here on the left,
[328.32s]  maximum average lifespan, mean lifespan.
[331.24s]  But then what I didn't show was
[332.32s]  there was also a significant increase in maximum lifespan
[335.26s]  as shown in the right panel.
[337.26s]  All right, so what about under non-calorie-restricted conditions?
[340.20s]  So from that, we go from the 0.2% supplemented media that had glucose,
[345.92s]  glucose in the media at 0.2%,
[347.50s]  and we go to 2%.
[349.14s]  So 10 times higher glucose level,
[352.44s]  what's the effect on lifespan in lithocholic acid
[354.90s]  versus non-lithocholic acid supplemented yeast?
[358.02s]  And we can see that even under non-calorie-restricted conditions,
[361.00s]  2% glucose,
[362.30s]  lithocholic acid supplemented yeast
[363.76s]  still had significant increases
[365.12s]  for both average and maximum lifespan.
[367.70s]  So that's why we can see
[368.82s]  LCA lithocholic acid extends lifespan in yeast
[371.78s]  under both calorie-restricted and non-calorie-restricted conditions.
[374.72s]  All right, so can lithocholic acid extend lifespan in other animal models?
[379.76s]  So for that, we go to flies.
[381.76s]  And lithocholic acid extends lifespan in flies too.
[384.76s]  So here again, we're looking at survival on the y-axis plotted against the age.
[388.38s]  So how long did the flies live?
[390.06s]  And this is data in male W1118 flies.
[394.44s]  I haven't come across any data for lithocholic acid supplementation on lifespan in female flies.
[399.06s]  If anybody's seen that data,
[401.06s]  please leave it in the comments so we can share the information.
[404.72s]  All right, so when looking at median and maximum lifespan,
[407.80s]  and this study being 50% survival for median lifespan,
[410.78s]  10% survival for maximum lifespan,
[412.64s]  we can see significant increases in flies that were supplemented with lithocholic acid
[417.00s]  for both median lifespan and maximum lifespan.
[420.68s]  All right, so what about mice?
[422.34s]  Can lithocholic acid supplementation extend lifespan in mice?
[425.88s]  And unfortunately, I haven't come across that data yet.
[428.36s]  And again, if anyone's come across that data, please leave a comment.
[431.62s]  I'd be happy to make a video about that in the future.
[435.58s]  All right, so what about human data?
[436.92s]  Is there human data that suggests a role for lithocholic acid on longevity in people?
[441.02s]  So fecal levels of lithocholic acid are higher in centenarians,
[444.64s]  so people who've lived to older than 100 years
[446.76s]  when compared with younger age groups.
[448.76s]  And we can see that data here.
[450.18s]  So we've got lithocholic acid, LCA,
[452.90s]  and that's micromoles of lithocholic acid per gram of feces,
[458.30s]  or how much lithocholic acid was in poop.
[461.06s]  And then there are four groups on the x-axis.
[463.48s]  So first, centenarians.
[464.94s]  In this centenarian group, there were 160 people
[467.56s]  who had an average age of 107 years.
[469.90s]  And then there were three younger groups.
[472.58s]  Older, which had an average age of 86 years,
[475.62s]  and there were 112 of those subjects.
[478.16s]  Young, which had an average age of 31 years,
[480.72s]  41 of those subjects.
[482.48s]  And then CEL, which are lineal descendants,
[485.64s]  so offspring of centenarians,
[487.86s]  that had an average age of 75 years,
[489.74s]  and there were 22 of those subjects.
[491.96s]  And what we can see is that centenarians
[493.50s]  had significantly higher levels of lithocholic acid
[495.88s]  when compared with all of the other groups.
[498.26s]  So higher than the older group,
[500.16s]  higher than the younger group,
[501.38s]  and higher than their kids.
[503.02s]  Now, let's take a sidestep as to why this may be important.
[507.10s]  And that's because relatively higher fecal levels
[509.30s]  of lithocholic acid suggests a role
[510.96s]  for gut bacteria on longevity.
[513.14s]  So why is that the case?
[515.42s]  So starting from cholesterol in the liver,
[517.98s]  cholesterol is degraded by a series of enzymatic steps
[520.56s]  to produce the primary bile acid,
[522.50s]  chino or kino deoxycholic acid, CDCA,
[526.74s]  which is then conjugated with either taurine or glycine
[529.76s]  to form toro-CDCA or glyco-CDCA.
[533.80s]  Now, those metabolites,
[535.50s]  those conjugated metabolites,
[537.06s]  are then released by the gallbladder
[538.44s]  after a meal into the intestine,
[541.30s]  where gut bacteria convert it
[542.96s]  into either ursodeoxycholate, UDCA,
[546.32s]  or lithocholic acid, LCA.
[548.22s]  So, in other words,
[549.66s]  lithocholic acid is exclusively produced
[551.52s]  by gut bacteria.
[554.04s]  So, all right, this was one study
[555.52s]  that I showed you for lithocholic acid levels in poop
[558.24s]  in human subjects, higher in centenarians.
[561.18s]  Have other human studies replicated this finding?
[565.14s]  And there is indeed another study
[567.00s]  that looked at lithocholic acid levels in centenarians
[569.10s]  when compared with younger age groups.
[570.70s]  And that's what we're looking at here,
[572.22s]  lithocholic acid levels in feces or poop.
[575.08s]  So the two groups in this study
[576.66s]  were centenarians or close to centenarians,
[579.64s]  people in the 94 to 105-year-old age range
[582.44s]  that had an average age of 97 years,
[584.90s]  and their kids who had an average age of 67 years,
[588.18s]  50 to 79-year-olds.
[590.06s]  And what we can see is that these centenarians
[592.00s]  or close to centenarians
[593.08s]  had a 43% higher level of lithocholic acid in feces
[596.98s]  when compared with their offspring.
[599.00s]  And this difference was statistically significant,
[602.02s]  as you can see by the p-value
[603.28s]  and false discovery rate, FDR,
[605.34s]  were both less than 0.05.
[608.08s]  All right, so with the goal of longevity,
[610.00s]  can levels of lithocholic acid be increased?
[612.28s]  And if so, how?
[613.90s]  Well, exercise may be one way to do that.
[616.38s]  And blood levels of lithocholic acid
[618.06s]  are increased after exercise.
[620.36s]  So this is after either one hour of endurance exercise
[623.86s]  or one hour of resistance exercise or strength training.
[626.98s]  So let's break down the data.
[628.58s]  So in this study, it was a very small study.
[630.32s]  It only included 10 people,
[632.40s]  and this study only included men.
[634.12s]  And again, if anyone's come across studies in women,
[636.44s]  please leave a comment.
[637.28s]  I'd be happy to share it with the community.
[639.78s]  So this was young men, 24 years old,
[642.40s]  lean with a BMI of 23.7,
[644.40s]  so not overweight or obese.
[646.58s]  And when I say lean,
[647.62s]  we can see by the body fat percentage was 12.7%,
[650.24s]  which is lean.
[651.14s]  And these were fit subjects
[652.66s]  that had a VO2 peak of 55.7.
[655.14s]  So these are not average fitness people.
[656.92s]  This is a relatively high level of fitness.
[658.98s]  All right, so what was the endurance training protocol
[661.94s]  for those who are interested
[662.92s]  in trying to increase their own lithocholic acid levels
[665.64s]  or at least reproduce the findings of this study?
[668.92s]  So there was a 10-minute warmup on the bike,
[670.98s]  and then it was 50 minutes of biking
[672.86s]  at 70% of their VO2 peak,
[674.76s]  so a relatively strenuous 50-minute bike ride,
[677.48s]  not including the warmup,
[678.82s]  but one hour of total endurance exercise.
[681.18s]  All right, so what was the effect
[682.14s]  of that one hour of endurance exercise
[683.90s]  on blood levels of lithocholate?
[686.04s]  So before exercise,
[688.00s]  lithocholate levels were 0.01 micromolar,
[690.54s]  and then 60 minutes after exercise,
[692.90s]  that amount was tripled to 0.03 micromolar,
[695.44s]  and it still remained elevated up to three hours
[698.04s]  after exercise at 0.02 micromolar,
[702.00s]  so doubled when compared with before exercise.
[704.94s]  So from this, we can see that lithocholic acid levels
[707.00s]  are increased up to three hours after exercise
[709.90s]  for endurance exercise.
[711.86s]  All right, so what about resistance exercise
[713.40s]  or strength training?
[714.28s]  So first, what was the strength training protocol?
[717.60s]  So there was a five-minute warmup on the bike,
[719.84s]  followed by 15 reps each for squats,
[722.04s]  push-ups, sit-ups, and back raises,
[723.60s]  and then the actual strength training protocol,
[725.62s]  aside from the warmup,
[726.78s]  was five sets of 10 reps each for knee extension,
[729.54s]  bench press, hamstring curls,
[731.30s]  lat pull-downs, and leg press.
[733.10s]  All right, so what was the effect
[733.98s]  on lithocholic acid levels in blood?
[736.10s]  So again, starting from before exercise,
[738.10s]  they had 0.01 micromolar levels
[740.42s]  of lithocholic acid in blood,
[741.82s]  which was then tripled either 60 minutes after exercise
[745.46s]  and 180 minutes, so three hours after exercise,
[748.38s]  blood lithocholic acid levels were tripled
[750.04s]  after this resistance exercise training protocol.
[753.46s]  So this then raises the question,
[755.14s]  is lithocholic acid levels,
[756.80s]  are lithocholic acid levels in blood
[758.72s]  higher in athletes when compared with sedentary subjects?
[761.46s]  And that's another one that I haven't come across that data,
[764.54s]  but if so, it could suggest that that may be one reason
[767.78s]  why there's an increase in average lifespan
[770.28s]  for at least in animal models for exercise training
[774.38s]  when compared with sedentary animals.
[776.66s]  So if anyone's come across the athlete data
[779.20s]  and lithocholic acid levels in blood,
[780.92s]  please leave it in the comments.
[781.78s]  I'd be happy to share it with the community.
[784.10s]  All right, that's all for now.
