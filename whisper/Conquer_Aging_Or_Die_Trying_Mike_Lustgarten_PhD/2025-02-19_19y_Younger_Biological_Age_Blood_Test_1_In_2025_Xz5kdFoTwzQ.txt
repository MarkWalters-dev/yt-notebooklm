[0.16s]  Two weeks ago, I blood tested for the first time in 2025.
[4.22s]  And note that this is test number 56 since 2015.
[8.08s]  So with that in mind, what's my biological age?
[11.02s]  That's what we'll see here.
[12.28s]  This is using Dr. Morgan Levine's biological age clock,
[15.32s]  FenoAge.
[16.26s]  And an important question to ask is,
[18.68s]  how good is FenoAge?
[20.00s]  How good is this biological age clock
[21.86s]  in terms of its correlation with chronological age
[24.06s]  and its association with risk of death for all causes?
[26.84s]  So I posted that video yesterday,
[28.42s]  and if you missed it, it'll be in the right corner.
[31.22s]  Also, if you have blood test data
[32.86s]  and you want to calculate your own biological age
[35.18s]  using this test, there's a downloadable free,
[38.22s]  you don't have to put your email in,
[39.84s]  link for my website in the video's description.
[42.90s]  All right, so when entering these nine biomarker data
[45.56s]  for these nine biomarkers,
[47.28s]  I get a biological age of 32.9 years,
[50.60s]  which is 19.1 years younger than my chronological.
[54.32s]  Now note that the theoretical maximum reduction
[56.60s]  for FenoAge versus biological age in this case
[59.96s]  is about 20 years.
[61.10s]  So this is my second best test over 38 tests
[64.78s]  over the past seven years or so.
[67.70s]  But note that this is just one test,
[69.54s]  and I see a lot of people online saying,
[71.66s]  my biological age is this or that,
[73.54s]  and it's only based on one test.
[75.60s]  I find more value in tracking year-to-year changes
[78.48s]  with multiple tests each year.
[80.88s]  For me, I think that's a better representation
[83.04s]  of tracking and trying to optimize age-related changes.
[87.34s]  So with that in mind,
[88.30s]  let's take a look at all data for FenoAge since 2018.
[92.58s]  As again, I have 38 blood tests over that span,
[95.52s]  which is what we'll see here.
[97.40s]  So in 2018 to 2019,
[99.46s]  I only had three blood tests
[101.04s]  where I could calculate FenoAge,
[102.98s]  and over those three tests,
[104.56s]  average biological age was 36.1 years.
[107.28s]  But note that three tests over a two-year span
[110.02s]  probably isn't enough data points
[112.14s]  to assess year-to-year change.
[114.14s]  So I started tracking more often.
[116.12s]  With six tests each in 2020 and 2021,
[119.48s]  so 12 tests total over those two years,
[122.04s]  average biological age was 35.6 in each year.
[125.94s]  So that's probably a closer representation
[127.70s]  of my actual biological age in both of those years.
[131.96s]  And then in 2022, I had my best data yet,
[134.92s]  and that's now over seven tests.
[136.42s]  I started to increase the testing frequency
[138.34s]  just by a bit to 33.8 years,
[142.26s]  which got a bit worse in 2023.
[144.34s]  Again, over seven tests, 34.7 years.
[147.34s]  About the same in 2024, but now over eight tests.
[151.12s]  So 34.8 versus 34.7.
[153.76s]  And now we can put that 32.9,
[156.04s]  this most recent test two weeks ago, into context
[158.36s]  as we can see that it's on the right track.
[161.62s]  Now, if we put all of the data together,
[163.56s]  we can see that I've avoided
[165.16s]  an age-related biological age increase.
[168.36s]  Now, digging deeper, that means that for these nine biomarkers,
[172.00s]  I've resisted age-related change,
[173.92s]  at least going back to 2018, 2019.
[177.24s]  Now, it's also important to note that
[179.68s]  even if all biomarkers stay the same using this test,
[183.80s]  phenol age increases by 0.9 years per chronological age
[187.60s]  for each one year that passes for chronological age.
[191.18s]  So with that in mind, starting in 2020,
[194.50s]  0.9 times four, the four years that have passed since then,
[198.02s]  I should expect to see 35.6 plus 3.6,
[202.06s]  so 39.2 years for an average value in 2025,
[206.76s]  not 32.9.
[208.12s]  So this illustrates that I'm on the right path,
[210.62s]  that the approach and approaches and correlations
[213.00s]  and all the things that I'm doing are on the right track.
[215.22s]  But rather than just entering data into a spreadsheet,
[218.48s]  let's take a look at the full blood test report,
[221.00s]  as I do have weak spots in my data,
[223.04s]  and I think it's important to not just focus on
[224.94s]  a small subset of biomarkers,
[227.52s]  which, although they do represent many organ systems in this case,
[230.90s]  for example, albumin, liver, creatinine, kidney, glucose,
[234.68s]  metabolic health, inflammation, CRP, and so on,
[237.36s]  but I think it's important to look at as many biomarkers as possible
[240.60s]  of as many organ systems as possible,
[243.20s]  so we leave no stone unturned
[245.78s]  when trying to slow aging and potentially maximize lifespan.
[249.00s]  So let's start off with page one of three of the blood test report.
[252.98s]  And note that I don't go to my doctor to order these blood tests.
[255.62s]  I go to ultalabtest.com,
[257.56s]  where I pick the tests exactly that I want.
[260.30s]  I then bring that to Quest Diagnostics.
[262.46s]  I pay the $9 blood draw fee,
[264.46s]  and then I get the majority of these results pretty quickly.
[267.78s]  So you can see I tested at about 7.30 in the morning,
[270.36s]  and I had the majority of these results back within 21 hours,
[273.70s]  which, in my opinion, is great news.
[275.64s]  So if you're into blood testing like me,
[277.36s]  and there's a Quest in your area,
[278.72s]  and you want to help support the channel,
[280.46s]  there's an affiliate link in the video's description.
[283.56s]  All right, so let's go through the high points
[285.24s]  and some low points of the blood test data.
[287.98s]  So first, HDL at 61.
[290.24s]  That's good news because it's now 14 tests in a row
[293.34s]  where HDL is greater than or equal to 50,
[295.96s]  with an average of 56.3 milligrams per deciliter
[299.14s]  over those 14 tests.
[301.74s]  Triglycerides at 58 isn't too far from optimal,
[304.30s]  which is less than 45 in terms of lowest risk of death
[307.52s]  from coronary heart disease, CHD.
[310.66s]  LDL at 77 is within the optimal range
[313.30s]  for lowest risk of death from CHD mortality,
[316.30s]  which is 65 to 120.
[318.12s]  And if you're wondering where I'm getting these ranges from,
[321.00s]  these quote-unquote optimal ranges,
[322.80s]  I have a new Patreon tier where I summarize all of those data,
[326.72s]  40 published papers and a 95-minute video
[329.14s]  that lives exclusively and will always live exclusively on Patreon,
[332.72s]  which includes data for these lipoproteins.
[335.80s]  That's a small subset of the biomarkers there.
[337.88s]  All of them are shown here.
[339.22s]  So if you're interested in what's optimal for biomarkers,
[341.50s]  check it out.
[342.46s]  All right, moving down on the list,
[344.04s]  HSCRP is 0.2 milligrams per liter.
[347.70s]  And that's now 22 tests in a row
[349.86s]  where HSCRP is less than the detection limit
[352.92s]  of 0.3 milligrams per liter or less.
[356.30s]  But then a potential weak spot.
[358.44s]  Homocysteine at 9.8 micromolar.
[361.12s]  Sure, it's not higher than the reference range,
[363.76s]  which you can see is greater than 11 micromolar.
[366.62s]  But I've had values in the 5 to 6 range about 15 years ago,
[370.12s]  so it's not a genetic issue.
[372.30s]  TMG, high dose, 4 grams per day, didn't make a dent.
[375.22s]  I did that experiment many years ago,
[376.72s]  and that's on my blog.
[378.74s]  I've done folate, B6, serine plus B6,
[382.00s]  B12, methyl B12 does bring it down by about 10%,
[385.24s]  but going from 11 to 10 isn't a big dent.
[388.30s]  So for this test, I tried something different.
[390.52s]  N-acetylcysteine.
[391.68s]  There are two published studies, two clinical trials,
[394.42s]  where N-acetylcysteine at 1.5 grams per day,
[397.38s]  which is what I supplemented with,
[399.40s]  reduced homocysteine.
[400.38s]  But in my case, probably not,
[402.90s]  as 9.8 is within my usual range without any supplements.
[407.60s]  So I'm still working on that recipe
[409.34s]  to try to optimize homocysteine and get it back
[411.60s]  to where I had it about 15 years ago.
[414.94s]  All right, on to page two.
[416.58s]  Glucose at 84 superficially seems like great news,
[419.36s]  especially when considering that it increases during aging,
[422.72s]  and that my 55 test glucose average since 2015
[426.36s]  is about 90 milligrams per deciliter.
[429.20s]  But digging a little deeper,
[430.78s]  this may not be the good news or great news that I think it is.
[434.08s]  And that's by looking at HbA1c.
[436.86s]  Now, 5.4 isn't terribly high,
[439.52s]  but it's my highest reading since 2015.
[442.74s]  Now, when considering that I have 55 tests
[445.22s]  for a lot of, for the majority of blood biomarkers,
[447.58s]  you might think that I have 55 blood tests for HbA1c,
[451.36s]  but I don't.
[452.06s]  I only have five tests.
[453.18s]  So 5.4 is the highest value of five tests
[457.00s]  over the past 10 years.
[458.42s]  With that in mind, for every test going forward,
[460.80s]  I'm gonna include HbA1c.
[463.56s]  All right, on to kidney function biomarkers.
[465.78s]  Creatinine also superficially looks like great news at 0.72.
[469.78s]  This is my lowest value ever.
[472.40s]  And it's especially good news
[474.06s]  when considering my 57 test creatinine average
[476.54s]  since 2015 is 0.94 milligrams per deciliter.
[480.22s]  Creatinine levels increase during aging in part,
[484.16s]  or almost exclusively because of reduced kidney function.
[487.00s]  So that it's lower than my 57 test average
[490.22s]  is superficially good news.
[492.12s]  But the first hint that there may have been some issue
[494.82s]  with my kidney function,
[496.02s]  at least moving in the wrong direction,
[497.48s]  I shouldn't say it's suboptimal or it's terrible,
[501.34s]  but moving in the wrong direction is blood urea nitrogen.
[504.54s]  So assuming no increase in protein intake,
[506.58s]  if bond increases,
[507.86s]  that could be because of reduced kidney function
[510.32s]  as it becomes less efficient
[511.64s]  at removing urea from the blood.
[513.80s]  So for my last test,
[514.70s]  it was nine milligrams per deciliter.
[516.34s]  For this test, it was 11 without an increase
[518.40s]  in protein intake.
[520.06s]  So that's the second sign
[522.72s]  that there may be some issue with suboptimal
[525.64s]  or a little bit below my best for kidney function.
[528.82s]  But more directly,
[529.84s]  and I can hear some of you screaming out there,
[531.92s]  measure Cystatin C.
[533.84s]  I did.
[535.06s]  For the second time,
[536.16s]  I measured it last year,
[537.30s]  it was 0.71.
[538.10s]  So I thought,
[538.52s]  ah, it's great news.
[539.40s]  I can just stick to creatinine,
[540.70s]  bun, and uric acid.
[542.52s]  But that 0.71
[544.28s]  is not what we see for this test, 0.79.
[547.54s]  Cystatin C increases during aging.
[549.38s]  So that 0.79 has gone
[551.16s]  or as a part of my normal range
[553.38s]  is going in the wrong direction.
[555.00s]  So with that in mind,
[556.10s]  I'm going to include also Cystatin C
[558.26s]  for every test going forward.
[559.72s]  All right, moving on to liver function biomarkers.
[563.84s]  Albumin at 4.9 is youthful.
[566.32s]  Alkaline phosphatase is less than 48,
[568.32s]  which is associated with lowest risk of death
[570.10s]  for all causes.
[571.48s]  Similarly, AST and ALT are close to optimal
[574.54s]  as both of those liver enzymes
[576.46s]  follow a J-shaped curve
[577.88s]  for all-cause mortality risk
[579.38s]  with values in the high teens
[581.44s]  or low 20s associated with lowest risk.
[584.00s]  So you can see I'm right there for that too.
[586.16s]  So liver health and function
[587.24s]  seems to be good news.
[588.32s]  All right, so then immunoglobulin G.
[592.04s]  And if you're familiar with the channel,
[593.38s]  then you saw the presentation by Dr. Li Chang
[595.70s]  who reduced IgG
[598.42s]  and sought an extension in median lifespan.
[601.32s]  In addition, other interventions
[602.78s]  that reduce IgG like calorie restriction,
[605.56s]  exercise training, and parabiosis
[607.34s]  also reduce IgG.
[609.92s]  So in my opinion,
[611.10s]  IgG is an important biomarker to track.
[613.24s]  I'm going to include it
[613.94s]  for every blood test going forward.
[615.54s]  I also have plans to look at biomarker
[617.68s]  versus biomarker correlations
[619.00s]  for IgG versus other biomarkers
[621.34s]  to try to identify
[622.66s]  where within that normal range may be optimal.
[625.78s]  IgG levels increase during aging,
[627.46s]  but there's very little data
[628.66s]  on all-cause mortality risk.
[630.90s]  So I'm going to use that biomarker
[632.52s]  versus biomarker analysis
[633.62s]  to try to identify within my own data,
[636.06s]  should it be 1,000?
[637.40s]  Should it be 1,100?
[638.62s]  You know, how low may be too low
[639.96s]  and how high may be too high
[641.14s]  within that reference range.
[642.52s]  But then potentially the weakest data
[644.86s]  in my biomarkers are my thyroid hormones.
[647.90s]  And that shouldn't be a surprise.
[648.96s]  I was diagnosed as hypothyroid in my 20s.
[651.96s]  I've been taking levothyroxine,
[653.56s]  which is T4,
[654.86s]  from about half my life.
[657.24s]  So in terms of thyroid function,
[659.00s]  I'm tracking free T4 and free T3.
[661.86s]  Free T4 is inactive.
[663.98s]  Free T3 is active.
[666.66s]  So I'd want to have a relatively high
[668.70s]  FT3 to FT4 ratio.
[672.16s]  In my case, it's relatively low
[674.12s]  with a ratio of 0.18.
[676.40s]  To put that data into context,
[678.36s]  that's the average value found in 90-year-olds
[680.78s]  with values about double that
[682.50s]  found in youth, 20 to 30 years old.
[685.26s]  So I'm currently in talks
[686.74s]  with my primary care doctor, PCP,
[689.06s]  and the endocrinologist
[690.14s]  to switch my prescription from T4 to T3.
[693.48s]  That may be a struggle
[694.58s]  because when I first moved to Boston 15 years ago,
[697.44s]  I was on T3
[698.98s]  and they basically made me switch
[702.22s]  to T4 instead of T3.
[704.24s]  So now I'm going to have to try
[705.22s]  to convince them to switch me back
[706.58s]  to T3,
[707.92s]  which may be a challenge.
[709.34s]  So stay tuned for that story
[710.58s]  in upcoming videos.
[712.34s]  All right, on to page three.
[714.06s]  So starting at the top with fibrinogen.
[715.94s]  Now this may seem like a random test to add,
[718.84s]  but when considering,
[720.42s]  when we're looking at what's under the hood,
[722.62s]  not just focusing on body composition
[724.32s]  or physical function,
[725.32s]  when really trying to optimize biomarkers
[727.82s]  and just specifically blood biomarkers,
[730.64s]  I think it makes sense to optimize
[732.54s]  and go after the biggest trees in the forest.
[735.14s]  So the biggest trees
[736.28s]  in terms of proteins and blood
[737.80s]  are albumin, globulins, and fibrinogen.
[741.30s]  So just to put that into perspective,
[744.10s]  albumin is five grams per deciliter.
[746.46s]  We all talk about
[747.34s]  and you hear about glucose
[748.84s]  and say LDL,
[750.46s]  which could be around 80 milligrams per deciliter.
[753.30s]  But we've got albumin,
[754.60s]  which is five grams per deciliter
[756.50s]  or 5,000 milligrams per deciliter,
[759.46s]  which is 60 times higher
[761.42s]  in terms of concentration
[762.86s]  relative to the things we all talk about,
[765.28s]  glucose and lipoproteins.
[767.48s]  Similarly, globulins
[768.90s]  are the second most abundant protein.
[770.66s]  Just using IgG as an example,
[772.22s]  that's 1,000 milligrams per deciliter
[774.44s]  when compared with the 80 for glucose.
[777.50s]  Now fibrinogen is also
[778.80s]  the third most abundant protein in blood.
[781.16s]  And you can see in my case,
[782.98s]  it's on the lower side,
[784.00s]  which is good news
[784.72s]  because fibrinogen levels
[786.06s]  increase during aging.
[788.48s]  So just for perspective,
[789.92s]  258 milligrams per deciliter,
[791.70s]  that's three times higher
[793.16s]  than glucose or LDL.
[795.78s]  So I think it makes,
[796.84s]  again, it makes the most sense
[797.90s]  to go after the biggest trees
[799.46s]  in the forest in terms of proteins,
[801.42s]  albumin, globulin, IgG,
[803.92s]  and fibrinogen.
[805.12s]  Now because fibrinogen
[806.24s]  is on the lower side
[807.74s]  and good news,
[808.90s]  I'm not going to measure it
[809.84s]  at every test.
[810.48s]  So this is a one-off.
[812.14s]  I'll probably measure it again
[813.06s]  once next year.
[814.18s]  And if I see some big deviation,
[816.46s]  then I'll start to include it
[818.12s]  for every test going forward.
[820.02s]  But now some weak spots.
[821.54s]  White blood cells at 3.4,
[823.00s]  and it's not a weak spot
[823.88s]  because the lab flagged it.
[825.04s]  It's a weak spot
[825.70s]  because as shown in that Patreon video,
[827.82s]  that 95-minute video,
[829.76s]  white blood cells
[830.38s]  that are less than 3.5
[832.12s]  or 3,500 white blood cells
[835.66s]  per microliter
[836.34s]  are associated
[837.44s]  with a shorter life expectancy
[838.92s]  relative to 3,500
[840.48s]  or 3.5 to 6.
[842.88s]  Now, that's only one part
[844.60s]  of the story.
[845.08s]  We can dig deeper
[845.90s]  because white blood cells
[847.30s]  aren't a homogeneous group
[849.52s]  of cells.
[850.62s]  They include neutrophils
[851.64s]  and monocytes
[852.32s]  which increase during aging
[853.56s]  and lymphocytes
[854.72s]  which decline during aging.
[855.92s]  So let's take a look
[857.50s]  at those data.
[859.06s]  So neutrophils
[859.70s]  at 1727
[860.74s]  are a bit low.
[862.84s]  Values around 2,000
[864.02s]  or 3,000
[864.66s]  are associated
[865.28s]  with lowest risk
[866.04s]  of death for all causes.
[867.68s]  And also,
[868.90s]  neutrophils
[869.58s]  increase during aging.
[870.56s]  So when considering
[871.10s]  both of those data,
[872.18s]  I'd prefer to be
[873.04s]  around 2,000.
[874.54s]  But,
[875.30s]  while 1,700
[876.30s]  isn't terrible,
[878.06s]  still,
[878.52s]  around 2,000
[879.40s]  I'd be happier
[880.02s]  if that was the case.
[881.26s]  Now, we can dig
[881.92s]  a little bit deeper too
[882.96s]  because if neutrophils
[884.20s]  and other white blood cells
[885.32s]  are low
[885.84s]  in the context
[886.84s]  of elevated inflammation
[888.58s]  that could suggest
[890.22s]  some immune deficiency
[892.22s]  or an inability
[893.86s]  to make immune cells
[895.02s]  in the presence
[896.10s]  of elevated inflammation
[897.12s]  could be bad news
[898.12s]  systemically.
[899.30s]  So,
[899.80s]  for more context,
[900.68s]  I looked at other
[901.52s]  pro-inflammatory cytokines
[902.92s]  besides HSCRP
[904.38s]  including interleukin-6
[906.68s]  which is important
[907.94s]  also because it's
[909.76s]  a senescence-associated
[911.48s]  secreted protein.
[912.78s]  So it's produced
[913.40s]  by senescent cells
[914.44s]  which increases
[915.48s]  during aging.
[916.72s]  So in my case,
[917.68s]  1.4 is below
[919.12s]  the detection limit
[919.90s]  so that's good news.
[921.50s]  I also measure
[922.30s]  TNF-alpha
[922.92s]  which isn't included
[923.80s]  on this report.
[924.86s]  I showed that data
[925.60s]  on Patreon
[926.20s]  but that too
[927.14s]  is below
[927.56s]  the detection limit
[928.78s]  so that's also good news
[930.16s]  and that's also
[930.88s]  a SASP-secreted protein.
[933.14s]  So keeping those
[933.80s]  relatively low,
[934.68s]  IL-6 and TNF-alpha
[935.80s]  during aging
[936.44s]  is important
[938.14s]  especially when
[938.76s]  considered that
[939.38s]  senescent cells
[940.12s]  and these proteins
[941.16s]  increase during aging.
[942.26s]  So when considering
[943.60s]  that neutrophils
[944.20s]  are a bit on the low side
[945.58s]  but inflammation
[946.86s]  is low,
[947.82s]  I'm not too worried
[948.52s]  about neutrophils.
[949.96s]  On the other hand,
[951.68s]  lymphocytes now
[952.70s]  are less than 1550
[954.26s]  for the fourth test
[955.64s]  out of seven tests
[956.68s]  and that's important
[958.14s]  or potentially important
[959.04s]  because lymphocytes
[960.00s]  around 2000
[960.92s]  is associated
[962.38s]  with lowest risk
[963.16s]  of death
[963.46s]  for all causes
[964.10s]  and they decline
[965.68s]  during aging.
[966.80s]  So I'm doing something
[967.78s]  in my approach
[968.46s]  that's causing them
[969.30s]  to be more consistently
[970.28s]  on the lower side
[971.50s]  relative to the higher side.
[973.48s]  Now it's not calorie intake
[974.86s]  because calorie intake
[975.92s]  for this test
[976.52s]  was almost completely
[977.68s]  identical to the last test
[979.06s]  and I track all of my food
[980.62s]  with a food scale
[981.24s]  for those who don't know.
[982.58s]  I think it was 2119
[984.20s]  for the last test
[985.30s]  and 2120 for this test
[986.80s]  and I'll have that
[987.90s]  diet composition analysis
[989.42s]  coming in the next video
[990.72s]  next week.
[991.76s]  So it's not calorie intake
[993.26s]  which is positively
[994.70s]  correlated with lymphocytes.
[995.94s]  In other words,
[997.10s]  a higher calorie intake
[998.18s]  is positively correlated
[999.60s]  with higher lymphocytes
[1000.60s]  in my data.
[1001.82s]  So I have other correlations
[1003.48s]  that I'm going after
[1004.32s]  to try to get my lymphocytes
[1006.32s]  more consistently back
[1007.58s]  to 2000
[1008.70s]  relative to where they are
[1010.16s]  for this test,
[1011.62s]  1300.
[1013.24s]  Alright,
[1013.98s]  red blood cell related measures
[1015.48s]  and when I mention
[1016.44s]  biggest trees in the forest,
[1018.12s]  red blood cells
[1018.62s]  are the most abundant
[1019.86s]  circulating cell type
[1021.04s]  in blood.
[1022.28s]  Now within red blood cells
[1023.52s]  is hemoglobin
[1024.42s]  and 14.5
[1025.90s]  may not superficially
[1026.90s]  seem like bad news
[1027.90s]  but my 54 test average
[1030.26s]  since 2015
[1031.06s]  is 15 milligrams
[1033.62s]  per deciliter
[1034.28s]  or 15 grams
[1035.16s]  per deciliter.
[1036.74s]  So 14.5
[1038.32s]  is going in the wrong direction
[1039.66s]  especially when considering
[1040.70s]  it declines during aging.
[1042.80s]  Additionally,
[1043.90s]  2024's average
[1045.02s]  over 8 tests
[1045.70s]  for hemoglobin
[1046.24s]  was 14.8.
[1047.72s]  So in my opinion,
[1048.80s]  this is how aging starts.
[1050.26s]  It was 15 for a long time
[1052.08s]  then it's 14.8,
[1053.26s]  14.5.
[1054.20s]  So I try to get
[1055.84s]  on top of these
[1056.64s]  biomarkers
[1058.78s]  as soon as possible
[1059.52s]  by following the correlations
[1060.90s]  and bringing it back
[1062.08s]  to 15
[1062.70s]  if I can
[1063.48s]  with various interventions
[1065.58s]  by following the correlations
[1066.76s]  as soon as possible.
[1068.62s]  Right?
[1068.88s]  Trying to avoid
[1069.72s]  that age related change
[1070.62s]  by following the data.
[1072.54s]  So going further
[1073.26s]  into red blood cell
[1074.24s]  related measures
[1074.88s]  is the MCV,
[1076.34s]  the mean corpuscular volume,
[1077.88s]  the average volume
[1078.82s]  of red blood cells.
[1080.20s]  So 92.8
[1081.28s]  is on the higher side
[1082.54s]  of my range.
[1083.24s]  It's not my highest though
[1084.16s]  but it's also not my lowest.
[1086.28s]  And I'm still not convinced
[1087.56s]  that this isn't
[1089.28s]  a calorie restriction effect.
[1091.88s]  So I've seen a lot of people
[1093.16s]  on CR
[1093.60s]  who have relatively high MCVs
[1095.70s]  actually much higher
[1097.02s]  than where my data is now
[1098.10s]  but nonetheless
[1098.68s]  I've had values
[1100.18s]  that are lower
[1100.74s]  in the high 80s
[1101.66s]  and that's the target.
[1103.50s]  But potentially
[1104.04s]  the best news
[1104.76s]  in my red blood cell data
[1105.98s]  is the RDW.
[1107.62s]  Not just because
[1108.28s]  it's a major predictor
[1109.54s]  for Levine's
[1110.50s]  biological age calculator,
[1111.84s]  phenowage,
[1112.22s]  but if you're familiar
[1113.36s]  with the channel
[1113.90s]  then you saw
[1114.50s]  Dr. Gary Churchill's
[1115.94s]  presentation on RDW
[1117.94s]  being an important
[1119.14s]  predictor of mouse lifespan
[1120.82s]  regardless if the mice
[1122.16s]  were eating a regular diet,
[1123.80s]  if they fasted,
[1124.82s]  or they were on calorie restriction.
[1126.86s]  So having a relatively
[1127.72s]  low RDW
[1128.60s]  for as long as possible
[1129.72s]  may be an important
[1131.28s]  pro-longevity strategy.
[1133.28s]  In my case,
[1134.00s]  11.8 is great news
[1135.44s]  as it increases during aging
[1137.16s]  and that's on the lower side.
[1139.66s]  Alright,
[1140.00s]  two more biomarkers to go.
[1141.08s]  I took DHEA sulfate
[1142.18s]  at 120.
[1143.76s]  Now,
[1144.22s]  I had data
[1144.88s]  about 15 years ago
[1146.76s]  that were 300.
[1147.80s]  So it's possible
[1148.66s]  that this is an age-related decline.
[1150.50s]  But at that time,
[1151.96s]  I may have been
[1152.86s]  taking DHEA sulfate.
[1154.22s]  I wasn't as rigorous
[1155.56s]  with tracking
[1156.22s]  compared to where I am now.
[1158.48s]  So that could be
[1159.66s]  a supplementation issue
[1160.58s]  or it could be
[1161.24s]  an age-related decline.
[1162.96s]  In terms of good news though,
[1164.90s]  my 19 test
[1166.48s]  DHEA sulfate
[1167.50s]  average
[1168.00s]  since 2022
[1168.98s]  is 125.
[1170.50s]  So 120
[1171.08s]  isn't too far
[1171.92s]  from that.
[1172.72s]  Now,
[1172.96s]  I may not be able
[1173.74s]  to get my
[1174.26s]  DHEA sulfate
[1175.32s]  all the way back
[1176.04s]  to 300
[1176.62s]  without supplementation,
[1178.40s]  but at least
[1179.22s]  avoiding age-related change
[1180.78s]  is the current target,
[1182.34s]  the current goal.
[1183.66s]  And just to add
[1185.00s]  why I'm measuring
[1185.76s]  DHEA sulfate,
[1186.80s]  why specifically
[1187.48s]  this hormone,
[1189.52s]  is because
[1189.96s]  androgens
[1190.62s]  as a group
[1191.20s]  decline during aging.
[1192.42s]  My testosterone
[1193.02s]  is generally
[1193.66s]  relatively high,
[1194.54s]  around 900.
[1195.68s]  So I haven't experienced
[1196.52s]  an age-related decline there.
[1197.94s]  Whereas DHEA sulfate,
[1199.30s]  I may have experienced
[1200.12s]  an age-related decline.
[1201.34s]  So I want to keep an eye
[1202.36s]  on that for every test
[1203.24s]  and try to optimize it
[1204.32s]  if I can.
[1205.44s]  When considering
[1206.04s]  that androgens
[1206.76s]  decline as a group,
[1207.64s]  I think it's important
[1208.34s]  to at least include
[1209.28s]  one member of that group
[1210.36s]  as a representative,
[1211.46s]  assuming that DHEA sulfate
[1212.78s]  is representative,
[1214.76s]  so that I don't wake up
[1216.12s]  40 years from now
[1217.02s]  with all low androgens
[1218.72s]  because I haven't been
[1219.46s]  tracking it over time.
[1221.30s]  And then,
[1221.68s]  last but not least,
[1222.50s]  PSA,
[1223.10s]  prostate-specific antigen,
[1224.54s]  as a marker of
[1225.58s]  prostate cancer risk.
[1227.56s]  So relatively lower
[1228.62s]  is better.
[1229.48s]  I've tested it sporadically
[1230.76s]  over the past
[1231.42s]  about 10 years,
[1232.94s]  five tests,
[1233.84s]  and 0.28
[1234.78s]  is on the lower side
[1236.10s]  of that range.
[1237.04s]  So that's good news.
[1238.10s]  I won't be testing that
[1239.00s]  at every test going forward,
[1240.10s]  but probably about
[1240.92s]  once per year.
[1242.44s]  All right,
[1242.70s]  so as I mentioned,
[1243.74s]  what I haven't yet showed
[1244.80s]  is what's the diet
[1246.26s]  and supplement approach
[1247.24s]  that corresponds
[1247.96s]  to this test,
[1248.84s]  this 19-year
[1249.70s]  biological age reduction
[1251.18s]  relative to
[1251.80s]  chronological age.
[1253.02s]  And that'll be
[1253.52s]  in next week's video.
[1254.54s]  a week from today.
[1256.82s]  All right,
[1257.34s]  that's all for now.
