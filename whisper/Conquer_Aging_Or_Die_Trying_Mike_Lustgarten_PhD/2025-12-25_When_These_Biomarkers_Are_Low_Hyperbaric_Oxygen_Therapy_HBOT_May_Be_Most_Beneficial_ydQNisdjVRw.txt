[0.00s]  If you have deficits in red blood cells, red blood cell number, you're going to have lower
[4.22s]  hemoglobin because hemoglobin is found in red blood cells. Hemoglobin carries oxygen. Your
[8.08s]  tissues aren't going to be as properly oxygenated. Actually, your cells aren't going to be as
[12.32s]  properly oxygenated as they should be. So HBOT, within that context, you're essentially forcing
[17.22s]  oxygen into your body and potentially improving aerobic metabolism because now it has oxygen that
[22.68s]  it didn't have before. So that might be part of the reason why he says things like HBOT improves
[27.98s]  my biomarkers. Maybe it's because his hemoglobin is lower than it should be. That said, at
[33.12s]  his chronological age, his hemoglobin is, he's got to figure out how to reverse that.
