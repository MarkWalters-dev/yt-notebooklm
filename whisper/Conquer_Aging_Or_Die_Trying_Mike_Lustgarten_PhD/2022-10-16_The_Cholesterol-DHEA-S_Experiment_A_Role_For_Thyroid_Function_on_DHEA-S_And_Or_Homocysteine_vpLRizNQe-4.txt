[0.00s]  In an earlier video, we saw that relatively low DHEA sulfate is a weakness in my data.
[5.82s]  More specifically, we can see that here.
[7.74s]  So on my last blood test on August 22nd, DHEA sulfate levels were 129 micrograms per deciliter.
[14.58s]  Now, if I only focused on the reference range, I would miss this as a potential weakness in my data.
[19.26s]  So why is that?
[20.60s]  First, DHEA sulfate levels decline during aging.
[23.76s]  So they increase up until about 20 years of age.
[26.64s]  Afterwards, they decline up to 80 years old on this plot.
[30.72s]  Now, when showing my most recent data of 129 micrograms per deciliter, which is 3.5 micromolar,
[37.74s]  we can see that I'm low for my chronological age.
[40.62s]  But potentially more importantly, I have two data points from my early 30s.
[44.46s]  And when plotting that data, we can see that I was once relatively high, and now I'm relatively lower.
[49.92s]  And if you look at the two lines, the red line and the black line, it looks like they're somewhat parallel.
[54.42s]  In other words, it looks like I've experienced an age-related decline for DHEA sulfate,
[59.02s]  at least based on these three blood tests.
[61.98s]  So then, how is DHEA sulfate related to all-cause mortality risk, or ACM risk?
[67.20s]  And we can see that here, we're looking at cumulative survival, or all-cause mortality risk,
[70.96s]  on the y-axis plotted against follow-up.
[73.12s]  And this was a long study that had a 27-year follow-up, although it only had about 400 subjects.
[79.00s]  But note that the average age is pretty close to my chronological age, so this data may be
[83.54s]  directly relevant to me.
[85.52s]  So in that study, people that had DHEA sulfate levels that were less than 129 had a significantly
[90.80s]  increased all-cause mortality risk when compared with people who had higher levels of DHEA sulfate.
[96.08s]  In this case, it was more than 200 micrograms per deciliter.
[99.68s]  So from that, we can see that a DHEA sulfate level of 129 micrograms per deciliter puts me
[104.90s]  at increased all-cause mortality risk.
[106.70s]  So then, how can I raise DHEA sulfate back to youthful and or healthy levels?
[112.84s]  And note that DHEA sulfate is produced by cholesterol degradation, and we saw that starting
[117.48s]  with cholesterol, that's converted into pregnenolone, which is hydroxylated into 17-hydroxypregnenolone,
[123.08s]  which is then converted into DHEA, and then DHEA sulfated to form DHEA sulfate.
[128.62s]  So to me, it made the most sense to raise blood levels of a cholesterol, and if blood cholesterol,
[134.30s]  since that's degraded to form DHEA sulfate, I'd expect that my levels of DHEA sulfate would
[139.28s]  then increase.
[140.74s]  So note that I've tracked diet in conjunction with blood biomarkers since 2015, and so then
[145.54s]  I can see which nutrient is most strongly correlated with blood levels of cholesterol in order to
[150.70s]  affect DHEA, potentially affect DHEA sulfate levels.
[154.28s]  So in my data, and I know that there are published studies showing that dietary cholesterol doesn't
[158.86s]  impact blood levels of cholesterol, but in my data, when comparing those two metrics, dietary
[164.16s]  cholesterol and blood cholesterol, 39 blood tests since 2015, and we can see that there,
[169.26s]  blood cholesterol on the y-axis plotted against the average daily dietary cholesterol intake
[173.26s]  on the X, we can see a significant correlation between those two.
[177.10s]  In other words, when I've had a higher dietary cholesterol intake, blood levels of cholesterol
[181.64s]  are also correspondingly higher.
[184.74s]  And note that, again, this is a correlation that's not causation.
[188.28s]  So from that, that raises the hypothesis.
[190.60s]  If I increase dietary cholesterol, I should expect to see an increase in blood cholesterol,
[194.58s]  and then I'd expect to have relatively higher levels of DHEA sulfate when compared with my
[199.80s]  last test.
[200.98s]  So to test that hypothesis, I used at-home blood testing, and I used the company known as
[205.92s]  Quantify, and one reason is because their mission is to radically increase human lifespan,
[210.74s]  and if you're familiar with the name of my channel, it's to conquer aging or die trying.
[215.38s]  So our models align.
[219.36s]  All right, and if you're interested in measuring your own DHEA sulfate or other biomarkers, I
[223.38s]  have a discount link for Quantify, and that will be in the video's description.
[227.20s]  So then I have 16 blood tests.
[228.98s]  For the first 12 blood tests, dietary cholesterol, my average intake was 22 milligrams per day.
[234.44s]  And then I added eggs and then measured DHEA sulfate for the next four tests on the next
[240.38s]  day.
[240.84s]  So my average dietary cholesterol, I increased it up to about 212 milligrams per day, and
[246.82s]  we can see that the p-value when comparing those two groups, there was a significant increase
[251.30s]  for dietary cholesterol when comparing the 12 tests versus the four tests.
[255.24s]  All right, so then four at-home DHEA sulfate blood tests the day after egg intake.
[259.36s]  Let's take a look at that data to see if it worked.
[262.30s]  And we can see that here.
[263.32s]  So next morning, DHEA sulfate versus dietary cholesterol as shown there.
[267.70s]  So for the first 12 tests, with that average dietary cholesterol of 22 milligrams per day,
[272.26s]  my average DHEA sulfate was about 119 micrograms per deciliter.
[276.70s]  And then after including eggs in my diet and measuring DHEA sulfate on the very next day,
[282.84s]  we can see that my average DHEA sulfate over those four tests was 105 micrograms per deciliter.
[288.72s]  Now, besides looking at averages between the two groups, we can compare them statistically
[292.38s]  with a two-sample t-test.
[294.10s]  And when I did that, these two groups are not significantly different.
[296.80s]  In fact, one could argue there's a trend towards lower DHEA sulfate with the inclusion
[301.08s]  of more dietary cholesterol, but note that those two groups of data aren't significantly
[305.12s]  different.
[305.66s]  So there was no effect of a higher dietary cholesterol intake on my DHEA sulfate.
[311.32s]  But note that the dietary cholesterol increase didn't raise blood levels of cholesterol.
[315.74s]  And I know that because Quantify also provided that data on the same day that I also have
[320.70s]  DHEA sulfate data.
[322.58s]  So blood levels of total cholesterol for the first 12 tests, when compared with the next
[326.90s]  four tests, was 106 milligrams per deciliter for both.
[330.68s]  And the p-value was 0.46.
[332.66s]  So in other words, total cholesterol, blood levels of cholesterol didn't change as a result
[337.54s]  of having more dietary cholesterol for those four tests.
[342.40s]  So we can see that there.
[343.74s]  So in terms of addressing the hypothesis, I did increase dietary cholesterol, but that
[348.92s]  didn't affect blood levels of cholesterol.
[351.14s]  And correspondingly, there was no effect on DHEA sulfate.
[354.58s]  Now, if total cholesterol impacts DHEA sulfate, in my case, it may be different for others.
[359.22s]  I'd expect a significant correlation between those two, between total cholesterol and DHEA
[363.70s]  sulfate.
[364.18s]  If I'm going to continue with this hypothesis, should I just increase cholesterol further
[367.90s]  or just trash it and go after something else?
[370.56s]  So note that total cholesterol is not significantly correlated with DHEA sulfate over those 16 tests.
[376.90s]  So that would argue against going after increasing blood levels of cholesterol as a strategy to increase DHEA sulfate.
[384.02s]  So note that there may be a more direct way to increase DHEA sulfate.
[388.46s]  And then I noted, besides supplementation, of course, I can already hear people saying,
[392.12s]  well, just supplement, fix the problem like that, and problem solve.
[394.84s]  But that doesn't address why my DHEA sulfate is low, and it doesn't get at the root.
[399.74s]  And I want to get at the root so that I can potentially improve that situation, you know,
[404.46s]  improve the root cause rather than put a Band-Aid on the problem.
[408.58s]  So note that I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my 20s.
[411.88s]  And since then, I've been taking levothyroxine, also known as T4.
[415.72s]  So my current dose is 137.5 micrograms per day.
[419.14s]  So is there a link between thyroid function with DHEA sulfate?
[424.04s]  So there is.
[424.92s]  DHEA sulfate is decreased in hypothyroidism.
[427.46s]  And we can see that here.
[428.40s]  So this is blood levels of DHEA sulfate in people that had an average age of 37 years.
[433.68s]  And in the hypothyroid cases, people diagnosed as hypothyroid,
[437.96s]  their average DHEA sulfate was 2.57 micrograms per mil.
[443.52s]  When compared with relatively healthy controls, which had 3.38,
[446.72s]  these two groups of data were significantly different.
[449.44s]  In other words, people that were diagnosed as hypothyroid had significantly lower DHEA sulfate
[453.98s]  when compared with healthy controls.
[455.88s]  Now, one study is nice.
[457.48s]  More studies help to see if this may be a real effect or not.
[461.02s]  In a second study where they compared hypothyroid patients with healthy controls,
[465.38s]  and in this case, the age range was closer to my chronological age of about 50,
[470.06s]  we can again see that the hypothyroid patients had significantly lower levels of DHEA sulfate,
[474.88s]  red arrow, when compared with the healthy controls, green arrow.
[479.00s]  Now, note that hypothyroidism doesn't indicate if it's too much TSH,
[483.90s]  or if TSH is too high, or T4 is low, T3 is low.
[488.32s]  It doesn't indicate which aspect of being classified as hypothyroid may be related to DHEA sulfate.
[494.24s]  So relatively higher as a free T3 are significantly correlated with higher levels of DHEA sulfate
[499.62s]  as one potential factor, one potential mechanism.
[502.18s]  And we can see that here.
[503.80s]  So serum levels of DHEA sulfate were significantly correlated with FT3, which is free T3.
[510.94s]  And we can see the correlation there and the p-value being statistically significant.
[514.62s]  So in other words, the higher that the levels of free T3 were in this study,
[521.18s]  DHEA sulfate was also relatively higher.
[524.60s]  So that then raises the question, what are my levels of thyroid hormones, including free T3?
[530.48s]  What's my data?
[532.06s]  So for that, I also used at-home blood testing.
[534.90s]  And this is from a test on October 3rd, so just a couple of weeks ago.
[539.04s]  Quantify doesn't currently have a thyroid panel, so I used a different at-home blood testing company.
[544.34s]  So what's my data?
[546.46s]  So first, starting with thyroid-stimulating hormone, TSH, and thyroxin, or free T4.
[552.68s]  Both of those data were within the reference range.
[555.24s]  Now, note that if you follow my channel and watch a lot of my videos,
[559.74s]  the reference range is usually not what's optimal for health and longevity.
[563.26s]  So along those lines, what's optimal for thyroid function, including these three markers of thyroid function,
[569.14s]  will be in a future video.
[570.86s]  All right, so what about free T3, as shown there?
[573.74s]  Well, we can see that my free T3 is low, especially low relative to the reference range,
[579.40s]  regardless in terms of what's optimal.
[581.68s]  So if I increase my free T3, when considering data on the last slide,
[586.50s]  that free T3 was associated with relatively higher levels of DHEA sulfate,
[590.82s]  if I increase that, will DHEA sulfate also increase?
[593.70s]  So that's my current goal for increasing DHEA sulfate.
[597.52s]  I'm going to have to meet with my doctor and probably have to go to the endocrinologist
[600.82s]  to adjust my thyroid dose, and then we'll have to see how that turns out in terms of DHEA sulfate.
[605.76s]  Now, interestingly, adjusting my T3 or T4 dose in order to raise my T3 levels may also impact homocysteine,
[613.92s]  which if you're familiar with my data, my most recent value was 12, which is aged,
[618.18s]  which is higher than what's expected based on my chronological age.
[622.12s]  So we can see that data here.
[623.70s]  When comparing patients, subclinical hypothyroid patients, SCH is shown there.
[629.98s]  So this is where they've got elevated TSH, but normal T4, and if you look at that data here on this graph or on this plot,
[636.48s]  you can see that TSH was indeed higher in the people who had subclinical hypothyroidism,
[640.70s]  but T4 was not different when compared with healthy controls.
[644.00s]  Nonetheless, when you look at homocysteine levels in the subclinical hypothyroid group,
[649.26s]  homocysteine was significantly higher when compared with healthy controls.
[652.86s]  Now, note that this is an observational study, and, you know, again, correlation does improve causation,
[658.00s]  but we can more directly address whether thyroid function may be related to homocysteine
[662.88s]  by looking at randomized controlled trials, RCTs, that included hypothyroid patients that were treated with thyroid hormone.
[670.06s]  And we can see that data here.
[671.36s]  So homocysteine is indeed reduced in hypothyroid patients that were treated with levothyroxine,
[676.08s]  again, also known as T4.
[677.86s]  So on the y-axis, we're looking at plasma levels of homocysteine,
[681.30s]  and then we've got two groups, or actually one group, but two different situations.
[686.10s]  In the first, they were hypothyroid, and in this case, they had very poor thyroid function,
[692.20s]  where their TSH was greater than 25.
[695.02s]  So in the previous studies, it was greater than 5 for subclinical hypothyroidism.
[699.08s]  This is like full-blown hypothyroidism where the TSH is dramatically elevated.
[704.68s]  And then these patients were treated with levothyroxine in order to restore thyroid status,
[710.48s]  which is known as euthyroid, and that therapy lasted from 3 to 9 months.
[714.98s]  So in looking at the data from the left compared to the right,
[718.82s]  we can see that homocysteine values were 14.1 when they were hypothyroid,
[722.58s]  and after restoration of thyroid status, so now they're euthyroid,
[727.04s]  their homocysteine levels significantly declined to 8.2.
[730.76s]  So there's a 44% reduction for homocysteine upon restoration of thyroid hormone status.
[736.40s]  So that then raises the question,
[737.96s]  will adjusting my relatively low levels of free T3 increase DHEA sulfate and or decrease homocysteine?
[745.24s]  And I don't have that data yet, but stay tuned for that data in a future video.
[749.46s]  All right, that's all for now.
