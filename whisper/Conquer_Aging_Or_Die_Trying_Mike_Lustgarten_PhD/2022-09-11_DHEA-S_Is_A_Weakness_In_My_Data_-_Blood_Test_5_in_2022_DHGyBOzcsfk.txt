[0.00s]  In my last video, I ended by asking the question, are there weaknesses in my blood test data?
[4.96s]  And I highlighted a total cholesterol of 133 as a potential problem.
[8.96s]  So in today's video, let's start off by investigating what's optimal for total cholesterol.
[13.72s]  And we can see that here. So starting with the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality on the y-axis
[18.52s]  plotted against blood levels of cholesterol on the x, and this data is in 45 to 54-year-olds,
[25.10s]  or more specifically, 44 to 55-year-olds, which is what was included in the supplementary data for the paper.
[31.34s]  And if you're interested in looking at this paper, this and all of the papers in this video will be in the video's description.
[36.96s]  So note that this is more than 3.3 million subjects in this age range,
[41.38s]  and my chronological age is within this age range of 44 to 55, so it may be most relevant to me.
[48.44s]  So starting with the referent, which was defined as 220 to 229 for total cholesterol,
[53.06s]  and when putting my data into perspective, we can see that a total cholesterol of 133 milligrams per deciliter
[59.08s]  is associated with a more than two-fold increased all-cause mortality risk.
[63.84s]  And superficially, this is bad news.
[65.62s]  So let's take a look at the aging data for a little bit more perspective.
[69.42s]  And note that low total cholesterol is found in youth, but also in older ages, which is what we can see here.
[74.56s]  So this is the larger study based on the study on the left,
[77.74s]  and this includes total cholesterol on the y-axis plotted against age of entry on the x.
[82.40s]  So this age range goes from 18 to 88 years.
[86.48s]  So what we can see for both men and women is that low total cholesterol is found in youth,
[90.38s]  somewhere in the 160 to 170 range, depending on if you're a man or a woman.
[95.16s]  And then total cholesterol peaks somewhere around 50 for both men and women,
[98.50s]  and after which we can see then an age-related decline,
[101.86s]  such that if we extrapolate further to about 100 years old or older,
[106.46s]  and I covered this in an earlier video, and if you missed that, it'll be in the right corner,
[110.10s]  we can see that relatively low total cholesterol can also be found in advanced age, including centenarians.
[117.68s]  So how can we know if low total cholesterol is reflective of youth or aging and increased all-cause mortality risk?
[124.94s]  So low total cholesterol within the context of other youthful biomarkers
[128.52s]  is associated with a decreased all-cause mortality risk.
[131.76s]  And that's what we can see here.
[132.90s]  So on the y-axis, we've got relative risk for all-cause mortality,
[136.56s]  and this is in people with total cholesterol less than 160,
[140.20s]  and with varying levels of albumin, ALB, and HDL cholesterol, HDLC.
[145.96s]  And note that this data is in a very small study.
[148.06s]  It only included 393 people.
[150.14s]  So this may not be what actually ends up being the truth for people who have a relatively low total cholesterol.
[155.98s]  We'll need more studies in this area.
[158.04s]  But note, this study was published in 2001, and I haven't come across any other studies,
[162.20s]  including the study on the left, that adjusted their data for things like albumin, for example.
[167.20s]  So this is in 79-year-olds, and let's get into the data.
[171.38s]  So when compared with the hazard ratio of 1,
[174.00s]  when the brackets or 95% confidence interval is completely below 1,
[178.82s]  as indicated by the green arrows there,
[181.20s]  we have a significant effect, statistically significant effect.
[183.80s]  In contrast, when the 95% confidence interval overlaps with 1, as shown there,
[189.04s]  that effect is not statistically significant.
[191.78s]  So let's start off by defining the aged phenotype.
[194.82s]  And in this case, the referent actually ended up having higher all-cause mortality risk.
[200.12s]  So in that case, this was people that had a total cholesterol less than 160,
[204.72s]  and relatively low albumin and HDL.
[207.38s]  So less than 38 for albumin, and less than 47 for HDL.
[211.14s]  And the reason that's the aged phenotype is because I showed in the earlier slide
[214.86s]  that relatively low total cholesterol can be found in advanced age.
[219.06s]  So we've got total cholesterol less than 160.
[221.42s]  And then albumin and HDL decline during aging.
[224.08s]  So we see relatively lower albumin and HDL in people with advanced age.
[229.18s]  So combined, low total cholesterol, low albumin, low HDL, that's the aged phenotype.
[235.06s]  So what happens if we have relatively higher HDL within that context?
[238.64s]  And then as I mentioned, we can see that the 95% confidence interval overlaps with 1.
[243.88s]  So this is not significantly different from the referent.
[246.40s]  So we can conclude that higher HDL, relatively higher HDL, doesn't impact all-cause mortality risk
[250.96s]  when we have relatively low total cholesterol and low albumin.
[254.98s]  What about when albumin is relatively high, as shown there?
[258.16s]  And now we have a significant effect, and I've defined this as the close-to-youthful phenotype
[262.18s]  because relatively low total cholesterol and relatively higher albumin are found in youth.
[266.82s]  And we can see that 32% decreased all-cause mortality risk as indicated by the green arrow in that group.
[273.68s]  But the best data of this bunch was for people that had the youthful phenotype of low total cholesterol
[280.80s]  and relatively high albumin and HDL.
[284.06s]  And note that, again, those three would be expected to be found in people who are younger,
[288.36s]  chronologically younger, compared with people of advanced age.
[292.18s]  So for that group, we can see that we had a 62% decreased all-cause mortality risk.
[297.40s]  So you can see the hazard ratio in the middle, 0.38.
[301.08s]  So to get the 62%, you do 1 minus 0.38 and you get 0.62, which would be 62%.
[306.90s]  A 62% reduction for all-cause mortality risk for people who had relatively low total cholesterol,
[312.84s]  but high, relatively high albumin and HDL cholesterol,
[316.02s]  were compared with people who had low total cholesterol, but the aged phenotype with low
[320.90s]  albumin and low HDL.
[322.58s]  And that's what we can see there.
[324.26s]  Relatively low total cholesterol, but relatively high albumin and HDL,
[327.72s]  those people have a reduced all-cause mortality risk.
[330.38s]  So before putting my data into perspective, there's another question that must be asked,
[334.34s]  which is, how does this combination compare with higher total cholesterol for all-cause mortality risk?
[339.40s]  And they compared that in this same study.
[341.62s]  So we've got all-cause mortality risk on the y-axis plotted against years of follow-up.
[346.36s]  And in this case, they re-examined the 79-year-olds up to six years later.
[351.40s]  So now we have three cholesterol groups, but in this case, it's total cholesterol less than 160,
[356.40s]  but with the relatively youthful phenotype of higher albumin and higher HDL.
[362.66s]  And we're comparing these three groups, including the two higher cholesterol groups of 161 to 239
[367.78s]  and greater than 240.
[369.04s]  Now there's no significant difference for all-cause mortality risk.
[372.98s]  So from this, we can conclude that low total cholesterol, but relatively high albumin and HDL,
[377.94s]  which again would be expected to be found in a youthful age or at a youthful chronological age,
[384.00s]  there was no all-cause mortality risk difference versus people who had higher total cholesterol.
[388.92s]  So to put my data into perspective for blood test number five in 2022,
[392.86s]  my albumin was 48 and HDL was 44,
[396.52s]  which is the close to the youthful phenotype.
[398.86s]  If my HDL was just a bit higher at 47, my data would be in the youthful phenotype.
[404.00s]  So based on this, accordingly, I'm not worried about total cholesterol of 133,
[408.70s]  but a relatively low DHEA sulfate is a weakness in my data.
[413.56s]  And we can see that data here.
[415.04s]  I measured DHEA sulfate on this same blood test where I calculated my biological age.
[419.72s]  And we can see that, well, first we can see that my DHEA sulfate is 129 micrograms per deciliter.
[426.94s]  And just as a quick intro, DHEA sulfate is the most abundant circulating steroid in people.
[432.00s]  Now, a big part of my approach is going after the biggest fish.
[434.58s]  For example, albumin is the most abundant circulating protein.
[437.70s]  Red blood cells are one of the most abundant circulating cell types.
[441.88s]  So I think it makes the most sense to optimize the things that are the most abundant in blood first,
[446.26s]  while focusing on the things that are lesser abundant second.
[449.54s]  Now, if I only focused on the reference range, as shown on the right, of 61 to 442 micrograms per deciliter,
[455.06s]  I would miss this as a potential weakness in my data.
[457.98s]  So why do I think this is even a weakness in my data?
[460.94s]  First, DHEA sulfate levels declined during aging.
[463.78s]  And this is in a study of about 4,700 people.
[466.18s]  If anybody's come across larger studies, it looked thoroughly for larger studies.
[470.32s]  And I try to always show data for the largest studies,
[473.20s]  as they may represent the population averages more accurately relative to smaller studies.
[479.36s]  So for DHEA sulfate, we can see that it peaks around 20.
[482.68s]  And then afterwards, it declines very steadily during aging.
[485.74s]  So putting my data into perspective of 429 micrograms per deciliter,
[490.18s]  which equals 3.5 micromoles per liter,
[493.08s]  we can see that I'm relatively low for my chronological age.
[497.06s]  And note that I'd be low even for younger ages.
[499.84s]  So that would be young for a 30-year-old.
[501.46s]  And even worse, this is what I'd expect to see someone who had an older chronological age.
[505.78s]  This may be common for people in their 60s, 70s, and 80s,
[508.66s]  based on the aging-related plot.
[512.86s]  So this is only one data point, though.
[514.96s]  And as many of you may know, I have up to 39 blood tests since 2015.
[518.84s]  So is this an anomaly?
[520.46s]  I mean, is this representative of my actual DHEA sulfate level?
[524.74s]  So do I have earlier data for DHEA sulfate?
[527.50s]  And I do.
[528.30s]  But it's only from 2005.
[529.68s]  This isn't a commonly performed blood test.
[531.98s]  So for whatever reason, in 2005, I measured it twice over a two-year span.
[535.92s]  And my average over those two tests was 300 micrograms per deciliter.
[539.86s]  And if we put that data on the age-related plot, we can see that it's there.
[544.00s]  And there's definitely been a decline for my DHEA sulfate levels during aging.
[548.90s]  Now, going further with DHEA sulfate,
[552.08s]  having a level at my current level is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.
[556.68s]  And we can see that here.
[558.06s]  So we've got the cumulative survival rate on the y-axis plotted against follow-up.
[562.30s]  And in this case, it was a relatively small study, but a very long study.
[566.46s]  You can see that there was a 27-year follow-up, which is very long for when compared with other
[571.70s]  studies.
[572.34s]  And the average age of these subjects was 51, which is pretty close to my chronological age.
[576.20s]  So it may be directly relevant.
[577.38s]  So what we can see is that the group that had the lowest DHEA sulfate levels, in this case,
[583.34s]  129 or less, had the worst survival rate when compared with people who had higher levels
[589.18s]  of DHEA sulfate, in this case, more than 200 micrograms per deciliter.
[593.54s]  So my DHEA sulfate seems to be a weakness in my data.
[597.74s]  Now, as I mentioned, is this one test representative of my actual DHEA sulfate level?
[603.52s]  So I blood test up to eight times per year.
[606.22s]  Will this be representative of my year-to-year change for DHEA sulfate?
[611.32s]  So in earlier videos, I've mentioned that at-home blood testing may be the future of health
[616.00s]  optimization.
[617.02s]  And one reason for that is because you can collect a large amount of data in a short period of
[621.20s]  time.
[621.94s]  So with that in mind, I've used another at-home blood testing company to accumulate 12 blood
[627.28s]  tests using Fingerprick in contrast with the venipuncture, which is how I obtained this
[631.94s]  DHEA sulfate level of 129.
[634.34s]  So I have 12 blood tests by Fingerprick within the last two months.
[637.58s]  Now, even with my rigorous testing schedule of up to six to eight times per year, it would
[643.92s]  take me a year and a half at most just by venipuncture to accumulate 12 blood tests.
[648.20s]  So at-home blood testing may be, as I mentioned, the future of health optimization.
[653.38s]  So to get those 12 blood tests, I used a company called Quantify.
[656.50s]  And as you can see, just with a screenshot from their website, their mission is to radically
[661.36s]  increase human lifespan.
[662.84s]  So anybody that's familiar with this channel, my motto is conquer aging or die trying.
[667.30s]  So I'm happy to use this product and to continue to use it in the future.
[671.24s]  And if you're interested in using it yourself, I'll have a discount link in the video's description.
[675.60s]  So what's my data for DHEA sulfate using Fingerprick?
[679.08s]  So we can see that here.
[681.56s]  And we can see that this is actually over a seven-week period, July 9th through August
[685.16s]  27th.
[685.90s]  And again, 12 blood tests using the test Quantify, from Quantify.
[689.68s]  And we can see over those 12 tests that my average DHEA sulfate level is 119.8 micrograms
[694.82s]  per deciliter.
[695.68s]  So that's pretty close.
[696.84s]  And in the ballpark of 129.
[698.74s]  So from this, we can conclude that DHEA sulfate by Fingerprick may be as good as
[704.24s]  venipuncture for at least DHEA sulfate.
[707.52s]  So then the big question is, how will I increase DHEA sulfate?
[710.98s]  And if you remember, I started this video with cholesterol.
[713.50s]  So what does cholesterol have to do with DHEA sulfate?
[716.40s]  So DHEA sulfate is produced via cholesterol degradation.
[719.78s]  And we can see that here.
[721.06s]  So first, starting with cholesterol, and this would be a process that happens in the adrenal
[724.42s]  glands, which are located on top of the kidneys.
[726.64s]  And they happen at three different portions of the adrenal gland, as indicated by that black
[730.74s]  rectangle.
[731.78s]  So with cholesterol, after that's degraded into pregnenolone, pregnenolone is hydroxylated
[738.10s]  into 17-hydroxypregnenolone, which is then converted into DHEA.
[742.54s]  And then DHEA is sulfated into DHEA sulfated.
[745.42s]  So the formation of DHEA sulfated is just four enzymatic steps via the degradation of cholesterol.
[753.98s]  So now note that if relatively low DHEA sulfate is because of low total cholesterol, I would
[759.74s]  expect that cortisol and testosterone would also be low.
[762.94s]  And that's because 17-hydroxypregnenolone is converted via two enzymatic steps into cortisol.
[768.90s]  And DHEA is converted also by two enzymatic steps into testosterone.
[773.46s]  So what's my data?
[774.78s]  First, starting off with cortisol to see if that's true.
[778.06s]  And this blood test quantify, the company quantify also includes cortisol and testosterone.
[783.46s]  They also have a female panel specific for some female hormones.
[787.58s]  So if you're interested in that, check it out.
[789.42s]  So for 12 blood tests using quantify, my cortisol level is 12.5 micrograms per deciliter.
[795.14s]  So let's put that data into perspective by looking at the age-related changes for cortisol.
[799.94s]  And this again is from that study of about 47, more than 4,700 to 4,800 people.
[805.36s]  So cortisol is a little bit different from DHEA sulfate.
[807.54s]  We can see a small increase for cortisol during aging.
[811.88s]  And putting my data into perspective, it doesn't look like it's low.
[814.60s]  It's somewhere in the midpoint of what you'd expect for someone of my chronological age.
[818.42s]  What about earlier data?
[819.34s]  Do I have earlier data though for cortisol?
[821.46s]  And for whatever reason, back in 2005, I measured it twice.
[825.30s]  And over those two tests, my average was 18.35 micrograms per deciliter.
[830.50s]  And when putting that data onto this plot, we can see that there too, I've had a reduction
[836.66s]  for cortisol levels over the past 17 years.
[840.82s]  Now, whether three data points is actually representative of the true story, I'm going
[844.58s]  to have to measure this a lot more going forward in the future.
[847.14s]  So stay tuned for that.
[848.56s]  So we've got relatively low within my own data, DHEA sulfate and cortisol over the past
[853.40s]  17 years, despite being on only a few blood tests.
[857.46s]  What about testosterone?
[859.06s]  So what's my data?
[860.50s]  So over those 12 blood tests, so at home blood testing using the company Quantify, my
[865.30s]  testosterone level is 5.6 nanograms per deciliter.
[868.46s]  So let's put that into the aging plot as shown there.
[871.38s]  And the story for testosterone is similar to DHEA sulfate.
[874.88s]  It peaks around 20 and then declines during aging.
[877.76s]  And putting my data into perspective, although it's not low based on the overall population,
[881.98s]  you can see I'm somewhere towards the higher end of the age range for a 50 year old.
[886.84s]  I do have earlier data, but only one test in 2005.
[889.92s]  And we can see that I've also experienced a decline for testosterone.
[894.42s]  Now, what were my levels of cortisol and testosterone optimal in 2005?
[899.48s]  I don't know.
[900.52s]  But again, I'm going to continue to measure these biomarkers and see how the story plays
[904.46s]  out with the specific focus on optimizing DHEA sulfate.
[907.80s]  So just as a brief summary, we can see that I've had within my own data, age-related declines
[913.76s]  for these three biomarkers for DHEA sulfate, cortisol, and testosterone.
[919.68s]  So when considering that these hormones are produced via cholesterol, in my opinion, the
[923.66s]  first step would be to increase blood levels of cholesterol.
[926.90s]  So how can I do that?
[928.12s]  What's the best way to do that?
[929.10s]  And for those who don't know, I've tracked my diet every day with a food scale since 2015.
[934.60s]  So I have dietary data that corresponds to each blood test up to 39 blood tests.
[939.64s]  So I can see within my own data what the best way may be to optimize blood levels of cholesterol.
[945.32s]  And for me, that may be by increasing dietary cholesterol.
[948.12s]  Now, I know that I've heard people saying that dietary cholesterol doesn't raise blood cholesterol.
[953.30s]  But we can see very clearly in my data that a strong correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.7
[958.44s]  and a significant p-value, that dietary cholesterol in my case may raise my total blood cholesterol.
[964.56s]  Now, just for reference for blood test number 5 in 2022,
[967.92s]  we can see that my average daily dietary cholesterol intake was 24 milligrams per day.
[972.92s]  And that is in conjunction with a blood cholesterol of 133 milligrams per deciliter.
[978.12s]  So when considering this correlation for dietary cholesterol with blood cholesterol,
[982.88s]  it would seem that with the goal of increasing DHEA sulfate,
[986.08s]  I can easily maximize dietary cholesterol intake, which may optimize blood level or increase blood
[991.12s]  levels of cholesterol.
[992.42s]  But will I improve one biomarker, DHEA sulfate, and make others worse?
[997.06s]  So let's check that out.
[998.96s]  So here we're going to see correlations for dietary cholesterol intake with big picture biomarkers.
[1004.34s]  And for those who may not have seen this analysis on my channel, I'll just run through it real quick.
[1008.12s]  These big picture biomarkers represent many biomarkers of organ and systemic health,
[1013.66s]  including glucose, which should be in any anti-aging approach,
[1017.20s]  a marker of methylation, including homocysteine,
[1019.96s]  three markers of kidney function, three markers of liver function,
[1023.36s]  all the major lipoproteins, HDL, LDL, VLDL, and lipoprotein A,
[1027.36s]  immune-related cells and the proteins, including globulins,
[1032.18s]  red blood cell-related measures,
[1033.68s]  a marker of inflammation, high sensitivity C-reactive protein,
[1036.12s]  and overall biological age scores indicated by Levine's phenowage and aging.ai.
[1041.20s]  So we've also got some other information on this table, in this table.
[1045.18s]  The little n next to each blood test is how many blood tests that I have data for it.
[1049.18s]  So for example, for glucose, I have 37 blood tests since 2015.
[1053.12s]  The r at the top left is the correlation coefficient,
[1055.92s]  and the p-value at the right,
[1057.40s]  on the right is the measure of statistical significance,
[1059.68s]  with less than 0.05 being statistically significant.
[1063.92s]  So what's significantly correlated for,
[1066.18s]  or how does dietary cholesterol significantly correlate with these big picture biomarkers?
[1070.34s]  So a higher dietary cholesterol intake, in my data,
[1073.30s]  is significantly correlated with higher blood urea nitrogen, BUN,
[1076.66s]  higher alkaline phosphatase,
[1078.88s]  higher LDL,
[1080.06s]  higher levels of neutrophils,
[1081.36s]  a lower lymphocyte percentage,
[1083.30s]  higher levels of monocytes,
[1084.62s]  higher platelets,
[1087.32s]  higher levels of red blood cells,
[1089.72s]  and that's it.
[1090.28s]  So we've got eight significant correlations,
[1092.02s]  within my own data,
[1092.96s]  for dietary cholesterol,
[1094.16s]  with other big picture biomarkers.
[1095.72s]  And note that once I've got enough data for DHEA sulfate,
[1098.20s]  I'm going to include that on this list,
[1099.70s]  as a big picture biomarker.
[1101.16s]  So we'll expand the list by at least one.
[1103.52s]  So then the next step is,
[1104.88s]  to address,
[1105.92s]  are these significant correlations going in the right or wrong direction,
[1109.26s]  in terms of aging,
[1110.32s]  and or all cause mortality risk?
[1112.02s]  Now I've covered biomarker directionality,
[1114.88s]  in terms of aging and all cause mortality risk,
[1116.70s]  in other videos.
[1117.78s]  But just as a quick review,
[1119.40s]  for example,
[1119.96s]  blood urea nitrogen,
[1120.92s]  alkaline phosphatase,
[1122.34s]  neutrophils,
[1122.86s]  and monocytes,
[1123.56s]  increased during aging.
[1124.52s]  So that we have positive correlations,
[1126.22s]  with dietary cholesterol,
[1127.66s]  suggests that these are going in the wrong direction.
[1129.64s]  So I've given them red arrows.
[1131.32s]  If anyone's got questions,
[1132.40s]  on the other biomarkers,
[1133.38s]  and why I've given them red arrows,
[1134.84s]  going in the wrong direction,
[1136.26s]  just leave a comment,
[1137.02s]  and I'll be happy to address that.
[1138.72s]  So now that we've got a net score,
[1140.60s]  of minus eight,
[1141.38s]  so eight red arrows,
[1142.92s]  eight correlations going in the wrong direction,
[1145.02s]  in terms of aging,
[1145.70s]  and all cause mortality risk,
[1147.36s]  what do we do with that information?
[1149.14s]  So if the net score was positive,
[1150.88s]  I would eat above my average intake,
[1152.68s]  for total cholesterol,
[1153.88s]  for dietary cholesterol.
[1155.04s]  If the net score was zero,
[1156.20s]  I would eat my average intake,
[1157.34s]  since 2015,
[1158.12s]  for cholesterol.
[1159.12s]  And in this case,
[1159.98s]  because the net score is negative,
[1161.64s]  that suggests that I should eat,
[1162.76s]  below my average intake,
[1163.90s]  for dietary cholesterol.
[1165.54s]  Now since 2015,
[1166.88s]  my average dietary cholesterol intake,
[1169.20s]  is 126.4 milligrams per day.
[1172.76s]  Now just for reference,
[1173.98s]  we can see that for this most recent test,
[1176.28s]  a couple weeks ago,
[1177.10s]  it was 24 milligrams per day.
[1178.70s]  So to stay within my own rules,
[1181.02s]  to eat below my average,
[1182.76s]  I can go from 24 up to 126,
[1185.72s]  for dietary cholesterol,
[1187.14s]  in order to follow the correlations.
[1188.70s]  And I think that following the correlations,
[1190.20s]  as much as possible,
[1191.30s]  leads to the best overall biomarker data.
[1193.42s]  So my current cholesterol intake,
[1195.94s]  with the aim of increasing it,
[1197.20s]  but staying below my average intake since 2015,
[1199.46s]  is now 91.5 milligrams per day,
[1202.04s]  of dietary cholesterol.
[1203.22s]  I've done that by adding a couple of eggs per week,
[1205.98s]  while still sticking to the macros and micros,
[1208.06s]  that have resulted in this,
[1210.04s]  biological age profile,
[1211.40s]  that is somewhere in the 15 to 20 year,
[1213.16s]  younger range,
[1213.90s]  when using Levine's,
[1215.00s]  and aging.ai tests.
[1217.14s]  So then the big question is,
[1218.30s]  can going from 24,
[1219.78s]  to somewhere around 90 milligrams per day,
[1221.80s]  for dietary cholesterol,
[1222.80s]  will that increase DHEA sulfate,
[1225.16s]  but not mess up the other biomarkers?
[1226.52s]  So stay tuned for that in future videos,
[1228.52s]  we'll address that data.
[1230.54s]  All right, that's all for now.
