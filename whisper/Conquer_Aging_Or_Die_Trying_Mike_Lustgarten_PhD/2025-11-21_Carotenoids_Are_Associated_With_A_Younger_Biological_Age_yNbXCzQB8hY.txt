[0.16s]  Dietary carotenoid intake is associated with a younger biological age, which is what we'll see here.
[6.32s]  So in this study, they looked at the biological age clock that I published
[9.20s]  all over and over on this channel, PhenoAge. And then they looked at its association with
[14.10s]  dietary intake of total carotenes, which included alpha and beta carotene, but also beta-cryptoxanthin,
[20.54s]  lycopene, and lutein-plaseaxanthin. In terms of what was significant, we put up a red line
[25.14s]  at one, at a PhenoAge of one. And then where the shaded blue line is either completely above one
[31.04s]  or completely below one, we have a significant association. What we can see for each of these
[35.70s]  dietary carotenoid intake variables is that relatively low levels or relatively low intakes
[41.66s]  were associated, significantly associated with an older PhenoAge, moving in the wrong direction.
[47.60s]  And on the other hand, relatively high intakes were associated with a younger PhenoAge. And I've
[52.50s]  included the amounts, the maximal amounts, that for each of these carotenoids that the range went
[57.80s]  up to. Now there is one exception to that, beta-cryptoxanthin. With beta-cryptoxanthin,
[62.32s]  there's a sweet spot where going too low may be bad for PhenoAge. But then you can see that
[66.80s]  although the data moves in the wrong direction at higher intakes, it just loses significance in terms
[71.34s]  of a younger biological age. So there may be a sweet spot for some beta-cryptoxanthin being associated
[76.60s]  with a lower biological age relative to higher. Now to compare this against my intake, we can see that
[82.02s]  it's in the same ballpark. And it's studies like this that are one reason why. But studies like
[87.58s]  this for me are just a guide. This suggests to me that having relatively high carotenoids should be
[93.94s]  a part of one's diet if the goal is to slow or minimize changes to biological age. But because I
[100.78s]  have so many blood tests, I'm able to see what my own correlations say and then come up with my own
[106.48s]  personalized data for where each of these measures should be. Now, is that actually causation? I don't
[112.82s]  know. But it may be a part of the story.
