[0.00s]  Since we're on the topic of skin, you know, uh, and sun and what's optimal for skin health. So
[5.86s]  I haven't covered this, covered this in a video. I may though, at some point,
[9.90s]  but, uh, so astaxanthin, that's another aspect of my diet where I've been lacking. And, um,
[16.74s]  so for people who know, or don't already know, I eat fish every day and this comes almost
[21.80s]  exclusively from wild caught sardines, um, mostly for the mega three, but obviously also for the
[27.08s]  protein, right? So, um, there's no, almost, there has historically been no astaxanthin,
[33.52s]  which can come from things like salmon, which also has the omega three and protein.
[37.56s]  Uh, so why is astaxanthin important? Well, um, astaxanthin may have positive benefits on skin
[43.50s]  and emphasis on may because there are only a few clinical trials. And what I'm finding these days,
[48.52s]  a lot on the interwebs is people will take one clinical study and, you know, very few people.
[54.76s]  And this spreads like wildfire into, this is going to be great. This works, right? I mean,
[60.64s]  I see that for like, just things like hydrogen water and, you know, methylene blue. There's like
[66.64s]  a little bit of published data in randomized controlled trials, not in vitro or cells. So,
[71.78s]  so anyway, uh, emphasis on may with astaxanthin. So, uh, these are two clinical trials and what,
[79.56s]  uh, what I highlighted is in this study, and, you know, we'll link to the papers in the video
[84.28s]  description or the pin comment in the first study. They looked at on the left in which I highlighted,
[90.36s]  uh, they did a study in women where it was six milligrams per day of astaxanthin oral supplementation
[96.00s]  and two, um, what is that? Two milliliters topically of astaxanthin. So, um, now which is optimal?
[104.24s]  Is it get it from oral, you know, food supplement or getting it topically? I mean,
[110.58s]  I don't know which is optimal, probably topical, probably be best if astaxanthin really can make
[115.88s]  a dent on skin health and skin aging to put the, uh, dose in perspective. I think average
[122.86s]  astaxanthin, I mean, I got this off the internet yesterday for, uh, you know, to get four milligrams,
[128.44s]  I think that's per 100 grams of salmon. So you need, you need a pretty decent size salmon,
[135.24s]  uh, wild caught salmon, you know, I wouldn't go with the farm stuff. Um, you know, so you probably
[140.82s]  need about 200 grams per day to get eight milligrams of oral astaxanthin per day. Nonetheless,
[146.32s]  they saw positive effects on skin, uh, skin health related measures, right? So, uh, skin wrinkles,
[154.66s]  age spot size, skin texture, moisture content, which declines during aging. Uh, so, so potentially
[161.38s]  beneficial. And this was a randomized control trial. This isn't, uh, you know, association.
[164.94s]  And then in the second study that they did, it was in men and here too, you know, without going
[170.26s]  through the data, showing the data, uh, yeah, just going, you know, with the abstract, usually,
[175.14s]  usually I show data, but for now, just going through the abstract in men, uh, crows, crows,
[181.06s]  crows feet wrinkle and elasticity, and then trans epidermal, epidermal water loss, which,
[186.42s]  uh, water, uh, hydration, skin hydration declines during aging. So astaxanthin was able to improve,
[192.60s]  uh, wrinkles and elasticity and, uh, reduce the trans epidermal water loss. Now, the reason I
[200.46s]  haven't focused so much on skin is because it can be, be very tricky because if you're visually
[205.16s]  inspecting someone's skin and then looking at it under the microscope, and then you're trying to
[209.50s]  quantify what you see under the microscope, that can be very tricky. And, uh, you know,
[215.76s]  and that's just someone who's, you know, worked in a research lab and, and done microscope,
[220.12s]  microscope related studies. And now you've got to look at visual differences between, you know,
[224.54s]  a few samples. It's, it's a challenge. So with that in mind, we can see that basically in the
[229.20s]  second study, again, randomized control trial. This was looking at astaxanthin supplementation,
[234.90s]  uh, in, in response to UV induced skin deterioration in healthy people, right? So what they gave was a more
[243.76s]  physiological dose of, uh, astaxanthin, which four milligrams per day, as I mentioned,
[248.16s]  isn't a crazy amount of salmon for 10 weeks. And just going into that idea of, of, um, you know,
[254.42s]  tricky to quantify this visually, right? So this is the skin swelling. The rectangles are the skin
[259.72s]  swelling in response to the UV induced, uh, exposure. So they made the skin, you know, uh,
[266.20s]  swelling it's, it's called a wreath, erythma probably mispronouncing it, which is basically just skin,
[271.24s]  you know, redness and swelling. So this was before treatment, right? Uh, placebo and astaxanthin
[276.82s]  and then placebo, uh, you know, post, post treatment, post, post placebo treatment,
[282.62s]  and then astaxanthin post placebo treatment. So if you're going to quantify, if you just look at it
[287.40s]  visually, you'll, you could say, all right, well, dark red, light red, you know, darker red, lighter
[292.24s]  red, but you know, then is the magnitude in the astaxanthin group better than the, what happened
[298.34s]  versus placebo? Because if you look at it, it looks like there is some improvement in less swelling in
[303.30s]  the placebo group too. So this is the emphasis on may improve skin health. Uh, you know, I'm not
[310.90s]  necessarily convinced yet. I'd probably place my biggest bet on, on topical, as I mentioned,
[315.54s]  but I'd like to see more studies, um, you know, for astaxanthin on skin health going forward.
[320.08s]  But then where it may get more interesting is that there's a recently published study coming from the
[325.12s]  ITP, which is a gold standard of lifespan related studies, at least in mice. And that's because
[330.70s]  they, they look at, um, supplementation in a few different test sites and use a very large sample
[336.72s]  size to evaluate lifespan, potential lifespan related effects. So it's not a sample size of 10 mice
[342.90s]  versus 10 mice placebo versus supplement. It's like, you know, 200 plus mice per group across a few test
[348.96s]  sites. So, uh, when pooling the data and this is data in males, it didn't work in female mice.
[355.00s]  On the same diets for the same duration. When looking at median survival, this is 0.5 survival.
[361.20s]  That's the time when half the mice have died and half are still alive. When compared with the
[366.14s]  controls, which are in red, the astaxanthin treated male mice, you can see that there's a significant
[371.44s]  shift to the right. So a significant increase in median lifespan. If you look at maximal lifespan,
[376.70s]  so you can look at, you know, 20% survival here. Um, there looks like there's a significant
[382.98s]  lengthening there too, where it's pushed out, you know, a little bit. Uh, I didn't, I didn't look
[388.60s]  in to see if maximum lifespan was impacted. I like to look at 10% survival. So when 10% of the mice
[394.12s]  are still alive. And if we do that, it looks like there's, you know, they're basically overlap curves,
[398.86s]  at least in terms of median survival and in mice seems to be promising. So with that in mind, I've
[405.10s]  cut down on my salmon, uh, sardine intake, and I've started to add wild caught salmon, uh,
[411.72s]  to about a 50, 50 approach. So now I'm cooking it about once a week or once every two weeks,
[417.14s]  you know, uh, and then pre-packaging it, uh, and then, you know, eating that over for a few days,
[423.48s]  maybe it's more of a 40, 60 still sardine. So I don't know what's optimal, but some probably
[429.72s]  better than none, whether that could impact median, median lifespan or could impact skin aging and
[435.58s]  health. I don't know, but some probably better than none.
