[0.00s]  For blood test number 7 in 2025, we saw that my biological age was 37.5 years,
[6.08s]  which is 15.3 years younger than the chronological.
[9.30s]  Not too bad when considering that the maximal theoretical reduction using this clock is about 20 years.
[15.12s]  But does this clock, phenol age, does it have blind spots?
[18.76s]  And if we look at the 9 component biomarkers, we can see that they represent many organ systems,
[23.86s]  including albumin and ALP, or alkaline phosphatase,
[26.72s]  as biomarkers of liver, health, and function,
[29.32s]  creatinine, so kidney function, glucose, metabolic health, CRP, inflammation,
[34.64s]  lymphocyte percentage, and WBC, white blood cells, so immune cells,
[37.76s]  and then red blood cell related measures, MCB and the RDW.
[42.36s]  But notably absent from this list are cardiovascular disease related biomarkers.
[47.06s]  Now that doesn't mean that this clock isn't good for its association with risk of death from
[50.84s]  heart disease related mortality. In fact, the opposite.
[54.04s]  An older phenol age is significantly associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular
[57.74s]  disease related mortality. And if you missed that video, I'll link to it in the right corner.
[62.90s]  But rather than that association, I think it makes the most sense to potentially avoid any weak spots
[67.70s]  by directly measuring cardiovascular disease related biomarkers.
[71.40s]  So in today's video, we'll do a deep dive into those biomarkers, which include
[75.06s]  VLDL, LDL, lipoprotein A, HDL, ApoB, and also HSCRP.
[81.50s]  So let's jump into the data. Starting off with page one of the report with the lipid panel at the top.
[87.18s]  And note that for this list and the 36 other biomarkers that I included for this test,
[92.06s]  blood test number seven in 2025, I don't go to my doctor.
[95.22s]  I go to ultalabtest.com where I pick exactly the test that I wanted.
[99.20s]  I then bring that form to Quest Diagnostics, the lab, and then I got the results relatively quickly.
[105.04s]  So we can see that I measured on October 27th, around seven in the morning,
[108.52s]  and then had almost all of the results, not just what you see on the screen.
[111.54s]  Again, the 36 other biomarkers within about three days.
[114.98s]  So if you're into blood testing like me and you want to help support the channel,
[118.16s]  you can do that by using the affiliate link in the video description.
[121.56s]  All right, so let's go through the data. Starting off with HDL,
[124.94s]  which for this test was 69 milligrams per deciliter,
[127.64s]  which then raises the question, what's optimal?
[130.52s]  If we go based on the reference range, at least what the lab suggests,
[133.94s]  anything greater than 40, 40 milligrams per deciliter is desirable.
[138.42s]  But my interpretation of the published literature is that 50 to 69 is optimal.
[144.22s]  And based on that metric, 69 is right at the limit of that range.
[148.26s]  So we give it a green check mark as that's good news.
[151.26s]  But this is only part of the what's optimal for HDL story as HDL declines during aging.
[156.66s]  So to that means, HDL has now been greater than or equal to 50 for 20 tests in a row,
[163.28s]  with an average HDL over those 20 tests of 59 milligrams per deciliter.
[167.60s]  That's potentially important because for the previous 44 tests,
[171.18s]  each average HDL was 45 milligrams per deciliter.
[174.38s]  So lower relative to where it's been for the past 20 tests.
[178.00s]  And I've mentioned this in other videos.
[179.50s]  For those who struggle with low HDL, as I did for a long time,
[182.78s]  it is possible to increase it.
[184.80s]  But in my case, it's taken a lot of blood tests and tracking diet and supplements
[188.74s]  to try to figure out what is a part of that recipe.
[191.74s]  And clearly, after 20 tests in a row, I think I've gotten the recipe down pretty good.
[196.02s]  So based on that, I've also avoided the age-related increase.
[199.34s]  So we give that also a green check mark.
[202.32s]  All right, next up are triglycerides.
[204.34s]  So first, note that we can approximate VLDL from triglycerides
[207.66s]  by dividing triglycerides by five.
[209.84s]  All right, so what's optimal for triglycerides?
[212.94s]  If we go based on the lab's reference range,
[215.32s]  anything less than 150 milligrams per deciliter is desirable.
[218.70s]  But if we go by all-cause mortality risk,
[221.38s]  which is not reflected in the lab's reference range,
[223.86s]  less than 90 may be optimal.
[225.70s]  But my optimal range for triglycerides is actually more strict,
[229.04s]  less than 45 milligrams per deciliter.
[231.34s]  And this isn't just an arbitrary number that I picked out of the air.
[234.06s]  This is based on a study of about 4.5 million people
[236.96s]  where triglycerides less than 45 milligrams per deciliter
[239.82s]  were associated with maximally reduced risk of death
[242.40s]  from coronary heart disease-related outcomes.
[245.02s]  So that's my target, less than 45 milligrams per deciliter.
[248.54s]  Additionally, triglycerides increase during aging.
[251.44s]  So it's not just about getting triglycerides less than 45
[253.90s]  for one or a couple of tests.
[255.38s]  It's for all tests and then avoiding its age-related increase.
[258.78s]  And if you wanna actually see those data
[260.60s]  rather than me saying the numbers,
[262.32s]  I have a new Patreon tier dedicated specifically
[264.64s]  to what's optimal for biomarkers.
[266.86s]  It currently includes data for HDL, triglycerides,
[269.50s]  and 33 other biomarkers,
[271.36s]  more than two hours of video content,
[273.52s]  52 published references.
[274.86s]  And again, these aren't the reference ranges.
[276.90s]  This is my reading of the literature
[278.26s]  for what may be optimal based on the largest studies
[280.50s]  that exist for each of these biomarkers.
[282.82s]  So if you're interested in that, check it out.
[285.00s]  All right, so back to the triglyceride story.
[287.32s]  So we can see that 52 for this test is higher than 45.
[290.44s]  So I've given it a close to red.
[292.60s]  It's not totally red.
[294.02s]  Red would be bad news.
[294.92s]  I've given it a dark orange X,
[297.60s]  which slightly worse than good news.
[300.82s]  In terms of avoiding the age-related increase,
[303.28s]  let's take a look at data for the last four years since 2022,
[306.34s]  as I have 30 tests for triglycerides over that period.
[309.46s]  So in 2022, average triglycerides were 68,
[312.30s]  then 67, then 65.
[314.72s]  And thus far in 2025, with one test left to go,
[317.74s]  63 milligrams per deciliter.
[319.30s]  So this is good news in that I've got the trend
[322.42s]  for triglycerides going lower.
[324.26s]  So we give it a green check mark.
[326.46s]  But on the other hand, it's not low enough
[328.38s]  to be below my 45 milligram per deciliter target.
[331.48s]  So we give that an X, an orange X.
[334.24s]  And I'm still interested,
[335.20s]  and I'm gonna still continue to try to get
[336.72s]  my triglycerides lower.
[338.14s]  And I get some of you may be screaming or into the comments,
[341.36s]  just increase fat and cut carbs,
[343.08s]  and your TGs will be super low, less than 45.
[345.92s]  Yes, this is true.
[346.84s]  But in my case, going super high for fat
[349.46s]  and very low for carbs starts to mess with other biomarkers.
[352.60s]  So the goal isn't to make one biomarker optimal
[354.88s]  while messing up others.
[356.24s]  It's what can I do to improve the broad net of all biomarkers
[359.62s]  and minimize negative impacts on a few biomarkers.
[363.58s]  All right, next up is LDL,
[365.38s]  which for this test was 73 milligrams per deciliter.
[368.30s]  So what's optimal for LDL?
[370.12s]  If we go based on the reference range,
[372.00s]  anything less than 100 may be optimal for primary prevention.
[375.18s]  And then the lab's reference range suggests
[378.36s]  going a bit lower, less than 70,
[380.14s]  if you have preexisting CBD or other health-related conditions.
[384.04s]  Instead, my reading of the literature
[385.50s]  is that 65 to 120 may be optimal.
[388.08s]  And that's based on a study of about 4.5 million people
[390.82s]  that looked at the association for LDL
[392.82s]  with CHD mortality risk.
[395.84s]  So with that in mind, my 73 is within that range.
[398.96s]  So we give it a green check mark.
[400.62s]  But this is only part of the story.
[402.40s]  The other part of the story
[403.22s]  is resisting age-related change.
[405.04s]  So how does LDL change during aging?
[407.54s]  Well, it doesn't have a linear increase or linear decrease.
[411.06s]  It increases and then decreases during aging.
[413.90s]  So what's my data?
[415.56s]  So that's what we're going to see here,
[417.00s]  LDL versus chronological age over the past 10 years.
[419.78s]  And I have 64 tests over that 10-year period,
[422.50s]  which is what we'll see here.
[423.90s]  With LDL on the y-axis,
[425.84s]  plotted against age, chronological age on the X.
[428.10s]  Now remember, the goal is to avoid an age-related increase
[431.68s]  and then a decrease.
[434.30s]  And that's actually what we see though,
[437.20s]  an age-related increase and then a decrease.
[439.96s]  Now this isn't just my data to show this
[442.52s]  in the broader population.
[444.72s]  We can see that here in this study of 15 million people
[448.08s]  who are not taking statins.
[449.78s]  With LDL levels, average LDL levels on the y-axis,
[452.84s]  plotted against age on the X.
[454.34s]  And first, we can see even in this very large population,
[458.62s]  low LDL is found in youth,
[460.60s]  with average values for men in green and women in red
[463.32s]  around 85 to 95 milligrams per deciliter.
[467.08s]  Then we can see that LDL peaks around midlife
[469.58s]  for both men and women,
[470.84s]  and then it starts to decline.
[472.86s]  But note that the age range here only goes up to 88 years.
[478.02s]  What about older than 88 years?
[479.74s]  Again, I've said this before,
[480.88s]  the goal isn't to get to 88 and then die.
[482.66s]  The goal is to live as long as possible.
[485.34s]  So in the data that's on the What's Optimal Tier on Patreon,
[489.02s]  there is data in centenarians in large studies,
[491.78s]  relatively large studies,
[492.70s]  where LDL continues to decline.
[495.06s]  So we can see that LDL has an inverse U-shape during aging,
[498.86s]  where it starts off relatively low,
[500.60s]  peaks at midlife, and then starts to decline,
[502.78s]  such that at very old ages,
[504.46s]  it can be as low as in youth.
[506.34s]  But then the big question is,
[507.50s]  how can we know if low LDL is a sign of youth or older age?
[511.94s]  And that actually ties into my data.
[514.80s]  How would I know if my data is youthful or aged?
[518.14s]  So there are two main conditions where LDL is lower.
[522.34s]  The first is liver disease.
[524.42s]  So how would we know,
[525.84s]  or how would I know if I have liver disease?
[527.56s]  And that's what's contributing to the lower LDL
[529.66s]  over the past few years in my data.
[531.86s]  Well, one way to gauge that is by looking at liver enzymes,
[535.24s]  AST, ALT, GGT.
[536.92s]  And if you check out the data on Patreon,
[539.42s]  the full blood test report,
[540.94s]  you'll see that my AST and ALT are close to optimal or optimal
[544.04s]  with data in the high teens, low 20s.
[546.44s]  And GGT has been less than 12 for all tests,
[548.94s]  which is my reading of the literature as optimal.
[551.34s]  So this is unlikely liver disease related story
[554.18s]  for LDL being lower over the past few years in my data.
[557.92s]  On the other hand, what about cancer cachexia?
[560.14s]  Cancer cachexia is the situation
[561.68s]  where muscle and fat loss within the context of cancer.
[566.60s]  Now, when considering that cancer incidence
[568.28s]  increases during aging,
[569.64s]  and it may go undiagnosed for decades
[571.42s]  until it's actually diagnosed at late stage
[573.72s]  or at some late stage at an older age,
[576.14s]  it's possible that LDL is declining
[577.96s]  throughout that whole period.
[579.22s]  And I have a video, I'm working on a video
[581.06s]  that will show that story
[582.60s]  where LDL is low in cancer cachexia.
[585.64s]  So how would I know if I'm on that path,
[588.14s]  just subclinical levels of something growing in my body,
[591.90s]  cancer related, and I just wouldn't know.
[594.16s]  Well, there are two biomarkers
[595.40s]  that may be a part of that story, albumin and HSCRP.
[598.70s]  Within the context of cancer cachexia,
[600.80s]  albumin levels decline and HSCRP increases.
[604.12s]  Fortunately, there's no pattern of that
[605.66s]  in my data right now.
[606.74s]  So I think it's unlikely that the LDL decrease
[609.20s]  over the past few years in my data
[610.58s]  is related to either liver disease
[612.30s]  or an undiagnosed cancer
[614.38s]  that could lead to cancer cachexia.
[616.44s]  And I should note that my body weight is also stable.
[618.88s]  If I had cancer cachexia,
[619.92s]  I'd expect to see weight loss,
[621.62s]  unexplained weight loss within the past few months.
[623.66s]  And there's no pattern of that in my data either.
[626.12s]  So that my data for LDL has increased and then decreased,
[629.18s]  it's more likely related to all of the diet changes
[631.46s]  that I've been making
[632.18s]  because I've been playing around with going high fat,
[634.78s]  high monounsaturated fat, lower fiber, higher fiber.
[637.74s]  So that's likely the story that's driving LDL
[640.16s]  for now in my data.
[642.08s]  But there's more to the LDL story.
[644.60s]  And that involves lipoprotein A.
[647.40s]  So what does lipoprotein A have to do with LDL?
[650.02s]  Lipoprotein A is a subfraction of LDL,
[652.70s]  which is what we'll see here or start to see here.
[655.52s]  So in this example,
[656.34s]  total cholesterol is 150 milligrams per deciliter,
[659.28s]  50 from HDL, 30 from VLDL.
[662.20s]  And note that this is not an ideal
[663.50s]  health cardiovascular profile
[665.32s]  as VLDL is way too high.
[667.34s]  VLDL, optimal VLDL,
[668.82s]  my target is nine milligrams per deciliter.
[670.94s]  As multiplying that by five,
[672.78s]  we get the triglycerides of 45 milligrams per deciliter.
[676.26s]  And then in this situation,
[677.44s]  LDL would be 70 milligrams per deciliter.
[680.22s]  Additionally, as I mentioned,
[682.08s]  lipoprotein A is a subfraction of LDL.
[684.12s]  So within this context,
[685.20s]  lipoprotein A would be zero.
[687.38s]  Now, the reason why that's important
[688.72s]  is because lipoprotein A
[689.86s]  is six to seven times more atherogenic
[692.06s]  relative to LDL.
[693.54s]  And that's on a per particle basis.
[695.50s]  And if you missed that video,
[696.62s]  the data for that,
[697.72s]  it'll be in the right corner.
[698.82s]  So when considering that the LDL of 70
[702.26s]  and lipoprotein A of zero,
[703.72s]  that would be the least atherogenic
[705.22s]  of the profiles,
[706.42s]  the cardiovascular profiles
[707.58s]  that we're gonna see as shown here.
[709.94s]  So when lipoprotein A increases,
[712.00s]  it becomes a greater fraction
[713.54s]  of the LDL, of total LDL,
[716.24s]  whereas then LDL declines.
[718.44s]  Such that at the far right,
[720.12s]  where all of that 70 milligrams per deciliter
[722.10s]  is lipoprotein A and zero is LDL,
[725.16s]  that would be the most atherogenic profile,
[727.32s]  even for the same total cholesterol
[729.06s]  of 150 milligrams per deciliter.
[731.50s]  So it's not just about tracking LDL,
[733.44s]  it's knowing how much of your LDL
[735.54s]  is lipoprotein A.
[737.32s]  So with that in mind,
[738.22s]  what's my data?
[739.56s]  So for this test,
[740.40s]  lipoprotein A was 80 nanomolar,
[742.18s]  and now we can see that the lab has flagged it.
[744.46s]  And for those of you
[745.20s]  who are regular viewers of the channel,
[747.20s]  first, thank you.
[748.38s]  Second, you should know
[749.06s]  that this isn't an anomalous finding.
[751.84s]  My lipoprotein A is almost always
[753.70s]  at the higher end of the reference range
[755.90s]  or around that,
[757.62s]  where the reference range being 75 nanomolar,
[760.42s]  which then raises the question,
[762.10s]  what's optimal for lipoprotein A?
[764.38s]  And as you've seen already through this video,
[766.24s]  generally the reference range
[767.52s]  is not what's optimal.
[769.12s]  To determine what may be optimal
[770.90s]  for lipoprotein A,
[771.92s]  let's take a look at lifetime risk
[773.50s]  for major cardiovascular events
[775.34s]  with increasing lipoprotein A,
[777.48s]  which is what we'll see here.
[778.84s]  With that lifetime risk
[780.42s]  for ASCVD atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,
[784.38s]  and that's in percentage on the y-axis
[786.66s]  plotted against age from 40 to 80 years.
[790.14s]  And here we can see that lowest lifetime risk
[792.20s]  for having an ASCVD event
[793.88s]  was associated with lipoprotein A values
[795.90s]  that were seven milligrams per deciliter
[797.84s]  or 16 nanomolar.
[799.84s]  And to put that into a risk number,
[802.38s]  that's about 13%,
[803.74s]  a 13% lifetime risk
[805.52s]  at that lowest lipoprotein A level.
[808.18s]  Now to put my data onto this plot,
[810.82s]  it will be somewhere around there,
[812.12s]  just above the light purple,
[813.86s]  with a lifetime risk a bit higher,
[815.66s]  around 18 or 19%.
[817.26s]  Still not optimal,
[818.98s]  but far from terrible.
[820.52s]  And when I say far from terrible,
[821.68s]  and apologies to anyone
[822.58s]  who has lipoprotein A this high,
[824.56s]  but we can see that
[825.38s]  having values of 150 milligrams per deciliter
[827.76s]  or 350 nanomolar,
[829.74s]  now we can see that lifetime ASCVD risk
[832.42s]  is about two times higher
[834.32s]  relative to the lowest values.
[836.08s]  So in terms of what's optimal
[837.92s]  for lipoprotein A associated ASCVD risk,
[841.10s]  my target would be less than 16 nanomolar,
[843.88s]  not less than 75 nanomolar,
[845.74s]  which is what the lab's reference range recommends.
[848.48s]  So with that in mind,
[849.94s]  what's my data?
[850.88s]  Because is that one test representative
[852.94s]  of all lipoprotein A tests?
[855.00s]  What's my data going back 10 years?
[856.64s]  And I get that some of you are going to say
[858.74s]  lipoprotein A is genetically determined.
[860.84s]  You only measure it once.
[861.86s]  You don't have to measure it ever again.
[863.26s]  But is that really true?
[864.82s]  Is there variability in lipoprotein A data?
[867.40s]  So that's what we'll see here.
[868.72s]  This is lipoprotein A versus age
[870.50s]  over the past 10 years.
[871.92s]  And I have 36 tests over that period,
[873.82s]  not 64.
[874.82s]  As here in the States,
[875.84s]  lipoprotein A is an add-on test.
[877.60s]  You have to order it extra.
[878.82s]  It's not automatically provided
[880.12s]  on a standard lipid panel.
[881.96s]  On the y-axis,
[882.86s]  we've got lipoprotein A,
[884.10s]  and that's plotted against age on the X.
[886.44s]  And then we can see that my average
[887.84s]  over this 10-year period
[889.04s]  is about 89 nanomolar.
[891.14s]  Now, if you remember,
[892.46s]  in terms of what's optimal
[893.62s]  for lipoprotein A-associated AS-CBD risk,
[896.82s]  my 89 nanomolar is actually far
[898.86s]  from that 16 nanomolar target.
[901.06s]  So we give that an X.
[902.22s]  So that's potentially bad news.
[904.12s]  Now, if there is good news in these data,
[906.88s]  it's that more recent tests
[908.24s]  have been closer to 80 nanomolar,
[910.26s]  about 9 nanomolar less
[911.60s]  than my historical average
[913.02s]  over this 10-year period.
[914.70s]  But then taking even a step further,
[916.64s]  I've had values as low as 69 nanomolar.
[918.88s]  Now, 69 nanomolar is still far away
[921.34s]  from 16 nanomolar,
[922.86s]  but it shows that there is variability
[925.08s]  in lipoprotein A data.
[926.84s]  Just measuring it once may not be sufficient.
[929.38s]  And to highlight that point,
[930.92s]  lipoprotein A is somewhat malleable.
[933.00s]  As you can see,
[933.56s]  I've had values as high as 110 and 145 nanomolar.
[937.58s]  So imagine if I only measured once
[939.42s]  and didn't discover part of the recipe
[941.38s]  for helping to keep it as low as possible.
[944.06s]  For now, at 80 nanomolar,
[946.06s]  and potentially I intend to get it even lower,
[948.02s]  and I'm not on any of these drugs,
[950.74s]  these pharma, statins or otherwise.
[952.98s]  I know statins don't lower lipoprotein A,
[954.70s]  but other lipoprotein A lowering drugs,
[957.68s]  I'm not on any of that.
[958.62s]  This is all diet and exercise and a few supplements.
[961.66s]  But imagine if I only measured once or twice
[964.08s]  and lipoprotein A was 145 nanomolar
[966.44s]  for my whole life,
[967.86s]  whereas I could potentially keep it
[969.32s]  at 80 or 70 nanomolar
[971.54s]  after discovering the recipe.
[973.02s]  So for those who've measured it,
[975.06s]  I'd say to keep measuring it
[976.30s]  and track diet and track supplements
[977.72s]  and try to discover your own personalized recipe
[979.96s]  for helping to keep lipoprotein A relatively low.
[983.40s]  Now, there may be some good news within this story,
[986.18s]  as in my case,
[987.10s]  with lipoprotein A being at the higher end
[989.16s]  of the reference range
[989.86s]  or around the higher end of the reference range,
[992.32s]  as there are at least two variables
[994.26s]  that can help in other studies
[996.34s]  that may be able to mediate
[998.56s]  lipoprotein A-associated CBD risk,
[1000.68s]  which include high sensitivity C-reactive protein
[1003.36s]  and the waist to hip ratio, WHR.
[1006.58s]  So what's my data for that?
[1008.46s]  So for this test,
[1009.44s]  HSCRP was 0.3 milligrams per liter,
[1012.32s]  which then raises the question,
[1014.08s]  what's optimal for HSCRP?
[1016.02s]  But additionally,
[1017.06s]  what's optimal for HSCRP-mediated,
[1019.40s]  lipoprotein A-associated CBD risk?
[1022.54s]  So first, when looking at the reference range,
[1025.18s]  in terms of what's optimal for HSCRP,
[1027.68s]  their optimal is anything less
[1029.14s]  than one milligram per liter.
[1031.20s]  In contrast, there's a meta-analysis that exists
[1033.84s]  that shows that as low as possible may be optimal
[1036.70s]  with values as close to zero,
[1038.78s]  but using 0.3 milligrams per liter
[1043.18s]  as an upper cutoff for HSCRP
[1046.18s]  in association with risk of death for all causes.
[1048.12s]  So that's my optimal range.
[1050.54s]  Additionally, in terms of the HS,
[1053.14s]  what's optimal for HSCRP-mediated,
[1055.30s]  lipoprotein A-associated,
[1056.46s]  ASCBD risk in that study,
[1058.30s]  and again, that video will be in the right corner,
[1060.96s]  having HSCRP values less than two milligrams per liter
[1064.26s]  was associated with lowest risk
[1066.44s]  within the context of relatively high lipoprotein A.
[1069.44s]  So based on that metric,
[1070.68s]  also good news for this test.
[1073.08s]  But HSCRP increases during aging,
[1075.64s]  and I wanna highlight this as much as I can.
[1079.30s]  There's so much in the longevity space
[1080.98s]  where people are focused on one test per year
[1082.72s]  or two tests per year.
[1083.94s]  Is that representative of a full year average?
[1086.18s]  And then are you testing every year?
[1088.26s]  We really wanna be looking at longitudinal change
[1091.00s]  as a true rate or pace of aging.
[1093.50s]  With that in mind, HSCRP increases during aging,
[1096.26s]  so we wanna avoid that age-related increase.
[1099.02s]  And to that means, it's now 28 tests in a row,
[1102.72s]  where in my case, HSCRP is less than or equal
[1105.76s]  to the lab's detection limit, 0.3 milligrams per liter,
[1109.14s]  and this is all tests going back to January of 2022,
[1112.44s]  so for the past four years.
[1113.68s]  So here too, this is good news, not just for HSCRP,
[1117.42s]  but potentially within the context of HSCRP
[1120.16s]  being a potential mediator of lipoprotein A-associated
[1123.96s]  ASCVD risk.
[1126.16s]  All right, so what about the waist-to-hip ratio?
[1128.18s]  And that too, that video also be in the right corner.
[1131.08s]  When the waist-to-hip ratio was greater than one,
[1133.42s]  and lipoprotein A was greater than 125 nanomolar,
[1136.56s]  or 50 milligrams per deciliter,
[1138.18s]  that was associated with an increased ASCVD risk
[1140.96s]  relative to lower waist-to-hip ratios.
[1144.08s]  So in my case, my waist-to-hip ratio,
[1145.94s]  and I measured it yesterday, is 0.88.
[1148.52s]  My waist size, 30 inches, and my hip size, 34 inches.
[1152.28s]  So this too may help mediate some of the risk inherent
[1155.82s]  in lipoprotein A being relatively high, in my case,
[1159.66s]  in terms of its association with ASCVD,
[1161.98s]  or lifetime risk of having an ASCVD event.
[1165.70s]  All right, so what about APOB?
[1167.32s]  So APOB containing lipoproteins include VLDL,
[1171.68s]  lipoprotein A, and LDL.
[1173.54s]  So it's more of an integrated measure
[1175.18s]  of all three of these lipoproteins.
[1177.48s]  And I should mention that APOB is also in IDL,
[1179.96s]  but that's a very minor fraction of all lipoproteins,
[1183.60s]  and it's generally not included in a lab test report,
[1185.80s]  so I won't cover that.
[1187.12s]  But for these three lipoproteins,
[1188.72s]  we can see that they contain the APOB-100 protein,
[1191.56s]  or APOB for sure.
[1193.36s]  So what's my data?
[1195.06s]  That's what we'll see here.
[1195.86s]  APOB for this test was 69 milligrams per deciliter.
[1199.24s]  What's optimal for APOB?
[1200.80s]  So the lab reference range is less than 90,
[1203.18s]  or their optimal is less than 90,
[1204.90s]  and then they recommend going less than 80,
[1207.32s]  depending on if you have various health-related
[1209.76s]  or adverse health-related conditions.
[1211.86s]  In contrast, my data is more strict.
[1215.18s]  My reading of the literature is more strict,
[1216.94s]  and that's based on more recent publications
[1218.84s]  in large published studies
[1220.56s]  that less than 70 for APOB may be optimal,
[1223.56s]  not just if you have a pre-existing condition,
[1225.64s]  but in the general population.
[1227.74s]  And that's where it's association
[1228.68s]  with heart disease mortality and all-cause mortality.
[1232.70s]  So based on that metric, 69 for this test, good news.
[1236.40s]  But also, again, longitudinal change.
[1239.00s]  So I've only started to measure APOB
[1240.62s]  over the past two years.
[1241.88s]  I have eight tests over that span,
[1243.88s]  and average APOB over that period
[1245.44s]  is 66.5 milligrams per deciliter.
[1247.84s]  So here too, good news
[1249.14s]  based on that relatively strict APOB cutoff.
[1252.08s]  Now, as I mentioned earlier,
[1253.22s]  this is a small snapshot of what I'm measuring.
[1255.48s]  I'm not just measuring phenol age.
[1256.98s]  I'm not just measuring
[1257.72s]  the cardiovascular disease risk biomarkers,
[1260.20s]  but 36 other biomarkers.
[1262.18s]  So if you're interested in that, that's on Patreon.
[1264.72s]  I should also say that the blood test was on October 27th.
