[0.00s]  Beta-hydroxybutyrate impacts many age-related phenotypes.
[4.26s]  But first, what is beta-hydroxybutyrate?
[7.02s]  That's what we'll see here.
[8.18s]  This is its chemical structure.
[9.98s]  And as its name suggests, it includes the short-chain fatty acid butyrate, as shown there.
[15.90s]  And then, to the left of the COOH functional group, it includes three other carbons,
[21.78s]  at the alpha, beta, and gamma positions.
[24.94s]  At the beta position, it has that OH group, or a hydroxyl group.
[29.02s]  So, putting it all together, we've got beta-hydroxybutyrate.
[33.32s]  Alright, so I mentioned that beta-hydroxybutyrate impacts many age-related phenotypes.
[38.02s]  And that's what we'll see here.
[39.68s]  So, beta-hydroxybutyrate has been shown to reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance,
[45.84s]  which collectively have been shown to be good for the brain, heart, fat, muscle, kidney, and the pancreas.
[52.64s]  Additionally, beta-hydroxybutyrate is increased in animal models of longevity,
[57.18s]  which is what we'll start to see here.
[59.64s]  First, starting off with data for mice on a ketogenic diet.
[63.24s]  On the y-axis, we've got beta-hydroxybutyrate circulating levels.
[66.74s]  And apologies that the image is a bit blurry.
[68.98s]  This is a screenshot from the paper.
[70.48s]  And if anyone's interested in the paper, I'll link to it in the video's description.
[74.44s]  And then, on the x-axis, we can see that these mice were relatively old, 26 months.
[78.66s]  And then, we've got three groups.
[80.62s]  C for the control diet, LC for low-carb.
[83.32s]  And as we'll see in a minute, that was actually high-fat, just not as high-fat as the ketogenic group in K.
[89.84s]  And then, we can see for the ketogenic diet-fed mice,
[92.92s]  they had approximately two-fold higher circulating levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate when controlled with the control diet.
[99.12s]  And that's potentially important because, in this study, a ketogenic diet extended lifespan,
[104.80s]  which is what we'll see here.
[106.08s]  On the y-axis, we've got percent survival plotted against age in days.
[111.10s]  And then, in terms of those three groups, again, there were the control diet, ketogenic, and low-carb.
[116.60s]  More specifically, the control diet was 17% fat, 89% fat for the ketogenic diet,
[122.74s]  and then that low-carb diet, in quotes, was 70% fat.
[126.30s]  Still a relatively high-fat diet, just not as high-fat as the ketogenic-fed diet.
[131.58s]  But note that these were isocaloric diets.
[134.20s]  And that's potentially important because when mice are fed a ketogenic diet, they become obese.
[140.12s]  So, in order to minimize that occurrence, all of the groups were isocaloric,
[144.48s]  meaning they ate the same amount of calories.
[146.88s]  In terms of the effect on lifespan, first, let's put up a red line at 50% survival.
[152.84s]  This is median survival.
[154.56s]  This is the time when half of the mice have died, and half are still alive.
[158.08s]  So, first, at that point, 50% survival for the control diet, we can see that median lifespan was about 900 days.
[165.64s]  And this is good news because in many lifespan studies, the control strain is relatively short-lived, shorter than 900 days.
[172.96s]  And then the intervention may get the animals to 900 days.
[176.56s]  But is that really a lifespan-extending effect if the controls are supposed to have a median lifespan of 900 days?
[183.70s]  So, in this study, it's good news that the controls lived a median of 900 days.
[188.68s]  And then the ketogenic diet significantly increased or pushed lifespan out to the right, with a median lifespan of 1,000 days.
[196.20s]  Here, too, this beats the 900-day rule.
[198.56s]  And if you want more information on the 900-day rule and its importance in lifespan studies in mice, I'll link to that video in the right corner.
[206.74s]  But note that this isn't the only lifespan-extending intervention that also has an increase for circulating levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate.
[213.82s]  That's also present in calorie-restricted mice.
[217.10s]  First, starting off with the data for beta-hydroxybutyrate circulating levels, which is what we've got on the y-axis.
[222.68s]  And then we've got two different diets.
[224.88s]  RD is the regular diet, and CR is calorie-restricted mice.
[229.28s]  And here, too, just like the ketogenic diet-fed mice, we can see that calorie-restricted mice had about a two-fold increase for circulating levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate.
[238.42s]  Now, it's well known that calorie restriction extends lifespan, which is one example as shown here.
[244.38s]  And note that these data aren't from the same study.
[246.62s]  The beta-hydroxybutyrate data is from a different study relative to this CR study that I'm showing here.
[252.90s]  And if anyone's come across a study where they measured both beta-hydroxybutyrate and lifespan in the same study,
[258.58s]  please post it in the comments, and I'd be happy to give you a shout-out in a future video.
[262.60s]  Nonetheless, let's take a look at the lifespan data for calorie-restricted mice.
[266.34s]  On the y-axis, we've got survival probability.
[268.64s]  Once again, percent survival.
[270.44s]  Plotted against age, let's put up that red line at median lifespan, or 50% survival, the time when half of the mice had died and half were still alive.
[278.20s]  And then we've got our two calorie-restricted groups, 20% and 40% CR.
[282.68s]  And we can see those significant increases for lifespan for the first, for the 20% calorie-restricted mice, and then for the 40% calorie-restricted mice.
[290.84s]  But note that these are just associations.
[293.46s]  In other words, we've got data that a ketogenic diet and a calorie-restricted diet extend lifespan in association for circulating levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate.
[302.24s]  Can we get closer to causation?
[304.90s]  In other words, is beta-hydroxybutyrate related to CR's lifespan-extending effect?
[310.20s]  And in order to get closer to answering that question, we need to see that beta-hydroxybutyrate is produced by glucagon signaling, which is what we'll see here.
[317.46s]  So glucagon, starting at the top, binds to its receptor, the GCG, glucagon receptor, R, GCGR, glucagon receptor.
[326.88s]  And when it does that, it triggers an intracellular signaling cascade that leads to the production of beta-hydroxybutyrate.
[333.30s]  And this is particularly important because glucagon signaling is required for the lifespan-extending effect of calorie-restriction, which is what we'll see here.
[340.76s]  On the y-axis, we've got percent survival, and this is plotted against days alive.
[345.80s]  Let's put up that red line at median survival, 50% survival, the time when half the mice have died and half are still alive.
[352.76s]  And then we can see that for one of those groups, all of the mice were still alive.
[357.36s]  And that's calorie restriction, 15% calorie restriction.
[360.10s]  All of the mice were still alive after 550 days.
[363.58s]  And then we can also see for one of those groups that half of the mice had died.
[367.54s]  And this is the GCGR, or the glucagon receptor knockout mice.
[372.58s]  So these are calorie-restricted mice that had their glucagon receptor knocked out.
[376.78s]  And then correspondingly, there should be no intracellular glucagon signaling.
[381.16s]  And within this situation, we'd expect to see no or very low levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate.
[386.52s]  Note that calorie-restricted mice are not on a ketogenic diet, which is known to produce beta-hydroxybutyrate by increasing glucagon levels.
[394.04s]  Calorie-restricted mice, in this case, on a standard high-carb diet, in order for calorie-restricted mice to have higher levels or increased levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate,
[403.86s]  they fast for up to 22 hours a day, eating the majority of their food within a very short window, two hours.
[410.88s]  So then this raises the question of how does beta-hydroxybutyrate vary during that up to 22-hour fast?
[417.48s]  And that's a particularly important question because then it suggests that there may be an optimal fasting window or an optimal fasting duration for mice on a calorie-restricted diet
