[0.00s]  Hey everyone, today's guest is channel regular Chris Manlumis. This is episode seven of our
[5.36s]  podcast series. So with that, welcome Chris and let's get into the outline. What do we have for
[10.22s]  today? Great. So thanks for having me on again, Michael. So today we're going to talk about for
[15.70s]  topics. We're going to cover a throwdown with Simlan, Brian Johnson and myself and with some
[21.56s]  helpful context and commentary from yourself to put it all in perspective for us. And then at the
[26.28s]  end, I'll be talking about an opportunity for everyone as I start up the 2026 Unaging Challenge,
[32.40s]  following up on the 2025 Unaging Challenge that's just wrapping up this year and give people an
[38.02s]  opportunity to put into effect the habits that will give them the longest life possible.
[43.24s]  Fantastic. All right. So we start with that head to head matchup that you lined up on
[46.60s]  on your blog. You've seen Brian. Yes. So there's a lot of great stuff in here. So I've started out
[54.18s]  with Brian Johnson saying, I have the best biomarkers in the world. None can match them
[59.16s]  living nor dead. And Brian is currently 48 years old and Seamland responded with, well, that's
[67.42s]  ridiculous. I mean, biomarkers change as you age and no one has, well, virtually no one has the
[73.36s]  biomarkers of someone who's a 20 year older, but I'm 31 and I'll compare my biomarkers to yours,
[78.84s]  Brian Johnson. It did so. And about 80 or 90 percent, if I remember right, if his biomarkers were
[83.80s]  better. But the comment is, is that Seamland is about 17, 20, almost 20 years younger than
[89.62s]  Brian Johnson. So yes, his biomarkers are better. So I'm here to provide context and a different
[94.98s]  benchmark for that as someone who's 55. And in the straight matchup, well, let's see how I compare
[101.24s]  to Brian Johnson and Seamland. So we're going to group these by areas. And I'm looking forward to
[105.80s]  having some comment for you on whether we've hit the mark, overshot the mark or whether we need to
[111.18s]  improve things. So the first thing to do is just sort of like the raw strength comparison.
[115.80s]  The grip strength is one that's oftentimes considered to be one of the best indicators
[121.34s]  of overall health, especially even in old people. Sometimes, as opposed to having them actually lift
[125.90s]  a bunch of weights, they'll just have older subjects come in and compare their grip strength.
[130.74s]  Because it's an indicator not only of the muscular strength of your hand, but also because of the
[135.62s]  vein requirements in order to be able to use your hand effectively, it can be a very strong
[139.82s]  indicator of your cardiovascular fitness as well. And for this one, the three of us are all in a
[144.62s]  quite tight range. I'm slightly stronger than Brian Johnson with my one hand grip strength of
[150.64s]  60 kilograms. I can't remember the units on this. Seam is stronger than both of us, but he trains quite
[156.62s]  a bit more and has a good 20 years on us. For the bench press, this has always been a challenge for
[161.88s]  me. My bench press is not where I want it to be at merely 98 kilograms estimated one rep max.
[167.48s]  And both Brian and Sim are quite a bit higher than the Sims got a very impressive 136 kilogram bench
[173.50s]  press. I'm working on it. But for then for the squat, one rep max for that one, Brian Johnson's
[179.42s]  about 115. It doesn't seem to be part of his daily exercise. Sims at about 160 grams for his one rep max.
[188.52s]  And it doesn't seem like an exercise for him as well. That's part of his base routine. For me,
[192.38s]  this is an everyday thing. Well, actually every other week I alternate between squats and deadlifts,
[198.60s]  but 160 kilograms estimated one rep max. I'm very comfortable with it. These lifts aren't
[204.30s]  increasing probably for any of the three of us at this point. It's mostly maintenance once you've
[208.88s]  been training for five, more than five years, but I'm continuing to maintain at this level. And I'm
[213.94s]  quite happy with that.
[214.94s]  Quick notes, Chris.
[216.52s]  Yep.
[217.00s]  All right. So I'm glad you mentioned that, you know, it's kind of an unfair comparison to have
[221.16s]  Seam in there, you know, or against Seam. My first thought is, first of all, he's a beast,
[226.56s]  which in the most, you know, respectful way possible, lean, fit, dedicated to training his
[231.70s]  whole life. So it's not a fair comparison because, you know, like you said, he's 17, at least 17 years
[238.16s]  younger than Brian and, you know, 24 years younger than you. So the other thing is that, but then he's
[244.02s]  the positive control, right? Potentially. And all of his biomarkers aren't perfect, but he's got pretty
[248.70s]  good biomarkers when, you know, from what I've seen the others. So there are two other things too.
[252.72s]  So one is single time point measurements, which are important, but you know, when we're talking about
[257.52s]  aging rate, and I think a lot of people lose sight of this is they'll only measure like once,
[262.62s]  you know, maybe once a year, once every couple of years, whenever infrequently, right? So is one
[267.70s]  measurement representative of a full year average, like, you know, for the sports players,
[271.48s]  if I'm a baseball player and I had four home runs in one day, and then no home runs the rest of the
[276.24s]  year, am I the world's best baseball player or maybe just on that day, right? So at some point,
[281.16s]  we've got to, as a field, get to the, you know, and I even thought about just showing, recording all
[286.92s]  of my workouts, right? So people can see, oh, look, he did 13 pull-ups on this day in 2018. Is he still
[293.34s]  doing 13 pull-ups or is he doing 13 pull-ups every workout, or is this just,
[297.70s]  peak? And then what does the rest of the year look like, right? It's kind of that,
[300.84s]  you know, bodybuilder in season, out of season mindset. Like, are you lean and fit all year round
[306.26s]  or are you muscle beast? You know, it's what I call muscle obesity, right? Where they're
[312.68s]  gigantic and big, and then they lean down, right? So, all right, that's another side of it. And then
[317.48s]  also, so you guys differ in terms of body weight. So normalizing to body weight, you know, strength per
[324.24s]  unit mass probably has some value if you're really going to do a head-to-head matchup,
[328.80s]  because I think, what's your, what's your body weight? I'm a 71 kilograms. Yeah. I think seam is
[333.72s]  in the same ballpark, but Brian's a bit smaller than that. Maybe five kgs, but still in the same
[339.82s]  ballpark, but normalize it to strength, normalize the body, strength, normalize the body mass could
[343.82s]  be important. Actually have one more, one more thought. So the other thing too, is I believe all
[348.32s]  of you guys, you know, these are your one RMs. Actually have two more thoughts. My gosh.
[353.86s]  Keep going, keep going. The spigot that is my mind, right? So, so bench press, you know,
[358.76s]  there's gotta be standardized limits because I don't know if you've ever seen like some of these people
[362.42s]  they'll post their TikToks and, you know, the official Olympic lift is, you know, the bar's gotta
[367.32s]  touch the chest, but then sometimes the person will arch their back tremendously. So they're moving the bar
[371.82s]  this much, but that's an official bench press, right? So, you know, some of the bench press is
[377.18s]  hard to, you know, mock, but, you know, but for something like a squat, someone doing a quarter
[382.28s]  rep versus a half rep versus ass to grass, you know what I'm saying? So seeing it can be beneficial
[387.84s]  there. And then the other thing I think to note, the last, this is my last, uh, my last thought on
[392.64s]  this one. Grip strength is pretty easy. You know, it's, you can't mess that one up, but, and grip
[397.28s]  strength is, I'd argue grip strength may be the most important biomarker on this, on this
[401.80s]  short list, not of all biomarkers when it comes to strength and function as you know, is the
[407.50s]  training for longevity, is it bench press? I mean, if you bench press, what all you're going to be
[412.62s]  good at is pushing stuff away from your body. And if you do a squat, all you're going to be good at
[417.04s]  is basically, you know, sitting, I mean, you're lowering the weight to a seated position, right?
[422.32s]  What about, you could make the argument, all right, picking stuff up, stuff up off, off the floor,
[426.18s]  maybe a squat would help, right? But, and I'm on it with these compound movements. They're part of my
[430.52s]  approach to, you know, a bench press deadlift, but you know, flexibility, you know, being able to pick
[435.80s]  something up from the floor, being able to do a lunge split squat, you know, things that are
[441.18s]  more functional movement based where flexibility and strength through a full range of motion,
[447.06s]  you know, so someone's got an outrageously high one arm squat, but then can't touch their toes.
[451.96s]  And I'm not, I'm not saying I know your flexibility isn't the greatest, but I'm not trying to pinpoint
[456.66s]  you. I mean, I think this is a broader, so for me, the long, the training for longevity isn't just about
[462.18s]  peak strength, maintaining peak strength, but also the ability to do functional movements. And I don't
[467.10s]  know how we would, how we would measure that. Do we have some yoga or Pilates instructor come in and
[471.94s]  test us all? So anyway, just something to think about. Well, one of the interesting things,
[476.38s]  actually, I mean, it, it's funny because that exact example you give of being able to touch your toes.
[481.12s]  Um, but until I got my squat into proper form, it was doing full reps down to below the crease.
[488.08s]  I wasn't able to touch my toes, but now that I've got full range of motion in my squats,
[492.38s]  now that flexibility has come. So in some ways, these are, are brought together. My latest challenge
[498.04s]  is not on this list, uh, cause not many people are trying to do it. I'm trying to work on doing
[502.02s]  a muscle up. I just started about two months ago. So muscle up is where you, you pull yourself
[506.86s]  up to the bar and then continue beyond that to do a dip to get fully above the bar. It's a,
[512.04s]  it's a mixture of a lot of technique, but the real thing is that there's a whole range of muscle in
[516.76s]  there that you never exercise doing bench press or lat presses or chin-ups in the gym. So it requires
[523.08s]  you not only to be able to get to this motion, which I can do around 10 or 10 or 14 chin-ups,
[528.66s]  but then from there to get from that to, to moving down to this level, to getting to where you're here
[535.10s]  is an exercise. It's really never done in normal exercise, unless you're a gymnast or something.
[539.50s]  Um, so in some ways it's very challenging for me, despite being able to 160 kilogram rep,
[544.88s]  14, 10 or 12 or 14 chin-ups, I'm starting at zero trying to do a muscle up cause it's a
[550.00s]  different range that I've never practiced before. But I'm finding that doing that is giving me a lot
[554.12s]  more ab, uh, abdominal, uh, exercise and other things and, and a lot more functional range that I
[560.36s]  never had touched before. So it is, it is definitely interesting that it like can be quite different
[564.96s]  for them. But I'm still of the feeling that basically you need to get the big stuff. And I
[569.20s]  generally feel that the physical exercise is more important than worrying about the flexibility.
[575.28s]  Although to the point though, I say that, and yet I do my, um, Tabata kind of exercise where I'm doing
[581.26s]  30 seconds of a high intensity, actually 20 seconds of high intensity exercise, but I'm always doing
[587.00s]  something very different for that, like jumping jacks or mountain climbers or burpees or something,
[591.88s]  which is then giving me that kind of a full body thing. At one point, as, uh, I got around 50 or
[597.46s]  so, I started to get what they call in Japan, 50 year old shoulder, uh, which is to say, because you
[602.10s]  haven't been doing this motion very much, your shoulder now has kind of lost some, um, range of
[607.76s]  motion and, uh, went through some exercises. I have a post on it in my blog, if you want to hear more
[612.64s]  about it or if this is something that's useful for you. But it was a series of just exercises of kind
[616.80s]  to bring that back into it and then did that for a period of a month or two. And then it just
[621.10s]  vanished and I've been fine since, but I've continued to do those kinds of, uh, functional
[626.18s]  movements, if you will, even though it's only four minutes, a Tabata workout is only four minutes long,
[631.38s]  two or three times a week. And that's had a huge difference in what I feel in my ability just to do
[636.16s]  whatever's required of me. So I can apply the strength that I have with my grip strength and
[640.18s]  my bench press and other things. Yeah. Nice. Uh, so just, uh, just a push back on the
[645.50s]  flexibility. I'm not saying that we all need to be, you know, uh, super uber flexible. It's just,
[651.24s]  you know, flexible for functional activity of daily living, you know, things. So, and within that too,
[658.30s]  and so I get what you're saying that the burpees and squats and deadlifts, you're going to have a
[663.78s]  greater flexibility than, than as if you never did that. But even, even training those movements,
[668.74s]  like, you know, I've seen it where I've trained, you know, I worked as a fitness trainer,
[672.04s]  you know, 20 years ago and I trained a 75 year old couple and they couldn't bend.
[676.98s]  I mean, their, their range of motion to bend getting close to the floor was so terrible that
[683.32s]  I can't, and getting out of bed, make that makes getting out of bed hard, forget picking stuff up
[688.30s]  off the floor, you know? So, um, I'm not saying to train like an old person, but at the same point,
[693.74s]  you know, if we're not trying to take my perspective is if we're, if we're not trying to,
[696.92s]  you know, optimize strength or full range of motion for functional stuff, in addition to the big
[701.68s]  stuff, we're shortchanging it. So also too, the muscle up is great, but there too, you know,
[706.20s]  it's like, I want to do part of me has that, I want to do these quote unquote fun, fancy things,
[711.84s]  but then I'm like, what do I care that I can do? You know? So even, even there too, it's like
[717.58s]  the technique of it, you know, you do the pull up. So some people will do the pull up and then they
[721.64s]  kind of push their way up to do that, you know, but then there are the gymnast types that it's
[726.00s]  one consecutive movement. And it's, they're just like, they're just, they're just like bouncing.
[731.20s]  It's so fluid, but functionally, I don't see the value. Like, so I don't, I don't spend the time,
[736.84s]  you know, to do, even though I should say as I'm doing my pull ups and I don't know,
[740.72s]  maybe this is just, you know, we're born from the same litter, the same generational litter.
[744.96s]  And we have a similar mindset for this, but lately when I've been doing my, my pull ups,
[749.94s]  you know, when considering that the muscle up, it's a real muscle up, a full muscle up is
[755.80s]  one consecutive movement, not to, not to squirm up. As I'm doing that first pull up,
[760.72s]  I'm thinking about, all right, I'm going to do it. So, so I don't know if I get there by accident,
[766.44s]  I get there, but if not, I'm content to just do, you know, high quality reps.
[770.40s]  Yeah. No, you're totally right. The muscle up is going to help me for nothing except for
[774.42s]  I'm being able to do a muscle up. It's kind of bragging, right? So yeah, I don't think it's
[779.18s]  functional, but it's fun. Yeah. At some point, at some point, you know, as I mentioned earlier,
[783.94s]  I think if people, if we're going to really compare strength and VO two max and all this stuff,
[788.24s]  people have to post videos, not just one video, but like week after week, just like we can watch
[793.46s]  the baseball players every day and then assess this, this means the better player versus this
[797.66s]  one over a full year. You know, I think that's the, and that's kind of my general comment for
[802.06s]  the head to head matchup is, you know, I want to see more than just one test. I want to see test,
[805.92s]  the test, the test consistency over time.
[808.08s]  Well, let's, let's keep working through the one test that we've got for now. I can provide some
[813.24s]  context on the other measurements and things, which I'll add in. So then now we start to get
[817.74s]  into some more, actually, this one started actually coming to the story of why I'm doing lifting or
[822.36s]  some of the health stuff that I'm doing at all when we talk about body composition. So the first one,
[826.44s]  I probably should have written this out is bone mineral density. So BMD, and this is grams per
[832.36s]  centimeter squared. And I come in in like last place on this one and far last. And this actually is a
[837.80s]  great story for me because I had a DEXA scan done, which you've done as well, where they do a scan and
[844.40s]  tell you what your body fat is, your muscle is, and also your bone density is. And when I did this,
[849.92s]  the answer was my bone density was poor. It was on borderline, I think that would have been around
[856.00s]  19 when I was around 45 years old. And the conclusion at that time is, okay, 45 year old person,
[863.54s]  you are already on borderline osteopenia, which is the one step above osteoporosis, where you need
[870.46s]  to be careful, you don't break a hip or a bone or something. And at 45, that's too early to be in
[875.14s]  that situation. I was there with my brother, and he got flying grades on it, his bone density was fine.
[881.18s]  And the reason is, is he'd always been lifting weights, and I never had. So I did the research. I mean,
[886.36s]  it wasn't just like, okay, he lifts weight, I don't, therefore I will. And lifting weights is one of
[890.38s]  the key determinants of what your bone mass density is, bone mineral density is. So I then
[895.30s]  changed from that. And that's when I started lifting weights regularly every week. So I'm now
[900.94s]  no longer osteopenic borderline, I'm now just below around 40 percentile or so, but well within the green
[908.36s]  range. I think both Sim and Brian Johnson had been lifting from a younger age, probably Sim had been
[914.46s]  doing the lifting, but Brian Johnson also was significantly larger before he decided to become
[919.60s]  unhealthy. He was quite overweight. And that is one of the things that carrying the extra weight
[923.84s]  is another way that you can have higher bone density. I've always been fairly lean. So while I'm
[929.32s]  distant third on this one, I'm happy to be third because I'm at least within the green zone on this
[934.08s]  one, which wasn't where I was when I started. Do you remember, Chris, do you remember what your
[938.18s]  bone BMD was at 45 versus now the actual number? No, I don't remember what that one was. It was
[945.54s]  significantly less. This is like even like if they just look at age irrelevant. So it actually
[952.26s]  increased significantly as I added in free weights and other things and serious gym time.
[957.72s]  So for me, that's a more important number knowing that you've not only resisted, you know,
[962.74s]  age related decline, or you could say, I don't want to say sedentary cause, but you know, your
[967.56s]  lack of strength training or less strength training then that you've reversed that because BMD declines
[972.62s]  during aging for me that you've resisted that and actually improved it over the past 10 years when
[977.22s]  it should be getting worse is potentially more valuable than people who have already high.
[982.60s]  We don't know if they started off higher and they've already come down. Right. I mean,
[985.80s]  and probably not, but you know, so I wouldn't, I wouldn't look at this as, you know, they're
[989.90s]  killing me in BMD. It's the other side of it is you've resisted age related change. That's a win
[994.54s]  in your own, you know, that, that, that's kind of the reason I don't, you know, and I know,
[998.80s]  I know I mentioned this where I was like, I don't care about head to head
[1001.72s]  matchups against other people. It's me against me against aging.
[1005.22s]  So pardon me. I'm, I'm looking this up. Of course, I have all of this online so I can,
[1009.10s]  um, uh, let's see, so I can find out what it was at the very first one. It would have
[1013.98s]  been 2014. Uh, no, it would have been, yeah, 2014. And I'm not, let's see here. We'll just
[1019.70s]  go through this and let me just take a look. It was a 1.128 at the time. So not that much,
[1026.34s]  uh, less, uh, but the different, the real important thing is that is now 11 years ago
[1031.72s]  and my net bone mass density is much higher. You can see it also when you look at the picture
[1036.76s]  of the actual DEXA scan, cause they give you sort of like a, here's your density through your body.
[1040.84s]  And I looked ghostly from the waist up, like my upper body had significantly lower bone mass density
[1047.06s]  to it. And now I've evened that up and overall increased it on average. So I'm quite proud of it.
[1052.22s]  As I said, it's pulled me off of what was a borderline and like a few, uh, hundreds of a
[1057.22s]  point on this make quite a bit of a difference. So the right direction. Yeah. And even if it was
[1061.60s]  stable over 11 years, also a win, you know? So yeah, it doesn't have to be the highest of the high,
[1067.78s]  you know, you don't have to have a 400 pound bench press, but are you resisting age related change
[1071.98s]  and even making a small improvement? That's a win. Yeah. And the, on the visceral fat, uh,
[1076.44s]  going on to the next one here as well, uh, SEMA is trained on this one quite specifically and,
[1080.86s]  and deliberately. And as you say, he's a bit of a beast. Uh, he's in the gym, uh, longer than I
[1085.56s]  would consider to be healthy, actually longer than he would consider to be healthy by his own
[1089.20s]  book. At the same time, he's 31 years old. It's fine. He's not going to fall over at this point,
[1094.06s]  especially given all the other things that he does, but I have a little bit less, uh,
[1098.10s]  visceral fat than Brian Johnson, despite having a few years on him. So then moving on to go ahead.
[1103.50s]  Going back real quick. So I think this is an important point because most people,
[1107.84s]  even if they're focused on, so when you think about the eat real food and exercise approach,
[1111.44s]  which is great, that'll get most people to 85, 90, maybe even 95. And a few people beyond that,
[1117.08s]  this is the silent, you know, aging right here, BMD, visceral fat, muscle mass, you know,
[1122.96s]  the body weight may stay the same, but the composition, body composition changes less,
[1127.72s]  less muscle mass, higher fat and visceral fat, less bone density. So I see this as essential in the
[1133.82s]  longevity testing hierarchy, top tier Dexa, you know, some measure consistent measure of body
[1139.72s]  composition and visceral fat may not seem like a big deal. You know, you just lower overall body fat.
[1144.80s]  You should have low visceral fat, but at least in rats, when you remove visceral fat, they live
[1149.54s]  longer and you know, it's like 20% longer. So visceral fat's a big one. Now in terms of the absolute
[1155.00s]  numbers for you guys, and again, you know, seeing being 17 to 24 years younger is fantastic, you know,
[1160.66s]  fantastic for his visceral fat and he purposely stays lean. Your, your data and Brian's data is
[1165.66s]  far from terrible. I mean, average values in 20 year olds is about where your data is. Both of your
[1170.96s]  data is half, half a pound. So 200 and so, 200 or so grams. The other side of that though, is,
[1177.26s]  is having 200 grams of visceral fat worse than seem only having a quarter kg, you know, a hundred
[1183.40s]  grams. And one way to assess that is, you know, so visceral fat is going to impact things like
[1187.82s]  liver health. So if you have a lot of visceral fat around your liver, fatty liver, you're going
[1191.86s]  to have higher triglycerides, worse metabolic health, including glucose and HbA1c. So if at
[1197.36s]  yours and Brian's level for visceral fat, if your triglycerides are less than 45, if your HbA1c is five,
[1205.36s]  it's not bad. Right. And so, um, and even if it's slightly on the higher side, I mean, both,
[1210.68s]  both of your data is in the outstanding range. So.
[1213.82s]  Yeah. I'm, I'm very happy to, we'll get to all of those figures that you just talked about,
[1217.82s]  like, uh, so the next one is, uh, is to talk about the hormones. Hormones, uh, I think that it's,
[1223.52s]  uh, much overdiagnosed. It seems to be kind of like trendy right now to get, um, testosterone,
[1228.96s]  uh, supplementation. Uh, I don't do any of that. Just work out at the gym and do the exercise stuff.
[1235.40s]  On these things, I think I was generally in the middle. Uh, testosterone was a little,
[1240.04s]  total was a little lower, but free testosterone between Brian Johnson and Sim. Um, sex hormone binding
[1246.62s]  globulin. I'm not sure I'm getting that quite right. You can correct me on that. Then I'm the
[1250.62s]  highest on that one considered like lowers considered to be better for that. And then DHEA,
[1254.68s]  I'm in the middle of them, but I don't, uh, I think these are in a normal range. Um,
[1259.14s]  there's no concern for me, but I don't have too much to say about this comments.
[1263.62s]  Yeah. So total testosterone. So, you know, and this goes to my general point to age related change,
[1269.00s]  less than 300 is associated with an increased all cause mortality risk.
[1272.64s]  How much above that is optimal is very debatable. I mean, I don't know that 900 is better than 700
[1278.22s]  is better than 500 in terms of mortality risk. There isn't any data on that, but resisting that
[1282.56s]  age related change is huge, right? So was your data once 700 now it's 500. I don't know. Right.
[1288.50s]  That's the big thing. Um, right. And I, I don't do the testing often enough to know whether that was
[1293.48s]  just variation or whether that's an age related decline. Yeah. Um, so also I, I can't get this
[1299.08s]  tested in Japan where I live. So I'm always sort of, uh, jet lagged to some degree and testosterone
[1305.24s]  varies a fair amount, uh, based on what time of the day when you test it highest in the morning and
[1310.18s]  lower in the later on. Um, so I'm always kind of like, okay, is this, is this a comparable number
[1316.34s]  when I go back and maybe measure it the first day after I get back and I'm very jet lagged from the
[1320.56s]  States cause I can get this tested in the States, but not here. So it's, um, yeah, I, I actually,
[1325.82s]  I definitely could use more data on this one to know where it's going.
[1329.62s]  Free testosterone is an interesting one because you know, it should track with total testosterone.
[1333.68s]  So if total T is low, free T will be low, but things like calorie restriction, lower
[1338.14s]  androgens overall, including free testosterone, but there's a lower limit there. Now you guys
[1343.24s]  aren't close to that lower limit. The lower limits is about five, five picograms per mil,
[1347.60s]  uh, being below that associated with an increased all cause mortality risk. But knowing that calorie
[1352.40s]  restriction lowers free testosterone and knowing the calorie restriction is like the gold standard
[1356.52s]  for longevity, you know, uh, at least in animal models, it raises that balance of is the, is
[1361.72s]  lower free T and even lower total T, not necessarily 500, but not below 300 is, is that pathological
[1368.20s]  or is that a sign of pro longevity? And to that point, SHBG, both, all of you guys are in, you
[1374.24s]  know, a quote unquote, what I would consider normal, but calorie restriction dramatically increases
[1378.78s]  SHBG to values greater than a hundred. So now that may not seem like a big deal, but SHBG binds
[1384.98s]  to total testosterone thereby reducing it in blood, which would then potentially lower free T. Now in
[1390.86s]  the calorie restricted state, as I mentioned, I don't know that that's a big deal, but SHBG increases
[1395.74s]  during aging and higher SHBG just during aging is associated with metabolic syndrome. So now you've got
[1402.38s]  this dichotomy of, okay, well CR increases SHBG, but that's a pro longevity potential thing. And then
[1408.62s]  you've got the average population where SHBG increases not on CR and that's associated with
[1413.18s]  metabolic syndrome. So this isn't as easy of a story as, as I think most people put out there.
[1418.52s]  Um, and then in terms of DHEA, I don't track that, but I track it's sulfated form DHEA sulfate,
[1423.78s]  which is a neurosteroid and, uh, declines during aging, just like testosterone. And that's actually,
[1429.20s]  you know, a biomarker of adrenal function. So, um, that's a big one to me that I'm tracking
[1434.12s]  consistently, you know, so. Yeah. All right. Yeah. I mean, it's, um, all, all things are,
[1439.06s]  are okay here. It's hard to sort of see where the big picture is on that, but as then as we come to
[1443.76s]  liver function and actually I've had a more recent test of these and my results have improved further
[1448.94s]  on these. Um, not sure what the issue was at the time, but this, um, for me, honestly, I don't have
[1453.88s]  that much to say about this. Uh, when they give me these tests, um, I also get an ultrasound as part
[1458.92s]  of them where they could look for fatty liver directly, right? They can then actually see sort of the fat
[1463.12s]  constant by the reflection or something. Not sure if it's reflection or what it is, but the ultrasound,
[1467.76s]  but my liver is healthy. Uh, these ones, by the way, are some of the, um, uh, you talk about the
[1473.34s]  history of it. When I ran the marathon, uh, was, I was training for the marathon, I should say.
[1478.32s]  These were all disasters. They were all like my AST, ALT, and GTG, or I think it was my AST and ALT
[1484.66s]  were both of them were like over 70, which is significantly outside, like 50 or below is kind of where it's
[1490.14s]  considered to be normal. So, um, they were very much affected by the overtraining or the overexertion
[1496.04s]  that, uh, was part of the practicing for the marathon. But within a month or so afterwards, I think they were
[1500.96s]  back within the range that they should be. I, I mean, aside from kind of knowing where I fall between,
[1506.04s]  uh, the three of us on these, cause I looked it up, uh, some of it with, uh, help from some of the reference
[1510.86s]  ranges that you have, I don't really know which of these are better or worse of them. So I'm open to comment.
[1516.18s]  How, how do these look? A couple of things. One, that's a great point about, uh, training
[1520.88s]  impacting liver biomarkers. So before every test I standardized when the last workout is before the
[1527.48s]  blood test to minimize that potential impact of training or overtraining on the biomarker. So
[1532.58s]  if the blood test is on a Monday at it's, it's a Friday workout, no later than a Friday workout,
[1538.26s]  Monday or Tuesday test Friday workout. So I've got three to four days because if, if training is going
[1542.94s]  to negatively impact the biomarkers, how can I see if other stuff, diet supplements, et cetera,
[1547.06s]  can move the needle. So I think that's an important point now in Brian and, and seems case. I mean,
[1551.84s]  I don't think they, it doesn't look like they did a hard workout the day before testing, but
[1555.12s]  for most people who are new to this, I'd recommend standardizing when that last workout is. And that may
[1560.52s]  be some of the pattern in your data, especially when considering your ultrasound on your liver.
[1564.54s]  And I think you're going to show triglyceride data, uh, which also links into fatty liver.
[1568.84s]  Your triglycerides are super low or low, which would suggest, you know, great liver health,
[1572.74s]  but in terms of what's optimal, AST, ALT, CMM, Brian would be closest. So high teens, low twenties.
[1579.20s]  Um, and when I say optimal, this is in terms of all cause mortality risk in study of 16.6 million
[1584.74s]  people, GGT less than 12, and also GGT increases during aging. So unfortunately you just hear,
[1591.90s]  I mean, it's probably training related. I find it hard to believe you'd be that far out, but they've
[1596.58s]  got you beat there. ALP less than 48. So they're pretty close to that. You, uh, Brian,
[1602.28s]  for whatever reason is off the charts. Well, not off the charts, but he's far away from it.
[1606.54s]  Yeah. High. And that's based on a meta analysis of, uh, 9 million people, about 9 million people.
[1612.94s]  Bilirubin is an interesting one because it's a, it's a biomarker basically of red,
[1618.32s]  red blood cell degradation. So hemoglobin is degraded into heme and then heme is degraded
[1623.42s]  by, by a series of steps into bilirubin. So at younger ages, the data is where Brian and
[1628.62s]  heme's values are, but in centenarians, bilirubin is often one or around that or higher.
[1635.00s]  So, and that's in association with, you know, longevity and reduced all cause mortality risk.
[1640.46s]  So, you know, on the one hand, you've got bilirubin relatively low levels is more likely
[1644.58s]  to be found in youth, but there's something also about bilirubin, whether it's an antioxidant
[1648.88s]  or it's neuroprotective, whatever the mechanism may be where at, at advanced ages, having higher
[1655.08s]  levels would be beneficial. I don't think having values out at one though, at your age would be
[1659.40s]  a good thing. I'd be aiming for Brian and, and seems values are. Um, and then in terms of albumin,
[1665.06s]  actually, I think your data is the best of the bunch. I mean, higher is generally better here
[1669.20s]  to though albumin declines during aging. And for those who don't know, albumin, albumin may seem
[1673.44s]  like an obscure biomarker relative to like glucose or triglycerides, but albumin's concentration
[1678.54s]  in blood is around where you guys have five grams per deciliter or 5,000 milligrams per deciliter.
[1686.22s]  Glucose at best, 80 milligrams per deciliter. So albumin is 60 times more concentrated in blood.
[1692.92s]  Even if you take cholesterol, 200 milligrams per deciliter, you know, it's a 25 X more concentrated
[1698.62s]  in blood. So when we think about the biggest trees in the blood forest, albumin is a big tree in that
[1703.28s]  forest. And, uh, at least in terms of concentration. So 4.5 to 4.8 or a bit higher is my optimal range.
[1710.76s]  You guys are all pretty close to that, but it declines during aging. So, uh, you know,
[1714.76s]  your data there would be the best of the bunch for only comparing one data point.
[1718.24s]  Oh, interesting. Okay. Right. And, and, uh, then in the kidney function, this one is always,
[1722.66s]  uh, kind of a bit of a challenge for me. And, and a lot of it goes to what you're talking about,
[1726.74s]  about standardizing around your workout times. In some of my old tests, for example,
[1730.60s]  I've gone and done a big workout on Sunday and then gotten my blood tested on Monday. Um, so EGFR,
[1736.56s]  as, um, I'm sure you're, uh, I know, you know, is, uh, basically very heavily influenced by the
[1743.08s]  creatinine, which can be produced by a workout. And, uh, oftentimes my creatinine, they'll tell me
[1748.20s]  that it's too high. I have sympathy here for Brian Johnson at 1.21, having a higher creatinine because
[1753.78s]  he's doing, uh, gym lifting pretty much every day. And then the EGFR, which is your effective
[1760.04s]  global femular rate or something, global femular rate? Glomerular. Glomerular. Thank you.
[1767.62s]  Fibulation rate. Filtration rate. Um, then that's calculated off your creatinine. So if you're
[1772.60s]  doing the lifting, then they're going to say your kidneys are bad, which is not the case. Um, so
[1776.64s]  that's why I have the cystatin C at the bottom, below that. Um, and cystatin C is one, correct me,
[1781.92s]  it goes up. No, it goes down as you age, right? Up. It goes up as you age, right? Yes. So, uh,
[1789.18s]  my, uh, cystatin C being a little bit less than Brian Johnson, but both of us are in the fine range.
[1794.80s]  So, um, Seem was saying that he thought that Brian Johnson had kidney problems. I would say no. I think
[1800.38s]  he's basically has higher creatinine because of the amount of workout that he's doing. And he probably
[1805.26s]  didn't take an appropriate break maybe before he did his blood test, which will then give him a poor
[1809.56s]  EGFR. But then the cystatin C, which is consistent with his age, maybe slightly, uh, higher than you
[1815.96s]  would want. It seems to be saying that his kidneys are fine. And then all of us are coming in with a
[1820.10s]  reasonable, um, uh, bun rating, I would say. Yeah. So I'd actually agree with Seem. Uh, and, uh,
[1827.26s]  so exercise could impact kidney function. I don't know if Brian's supplementing with creatine,
[1832.52s]  which could increase creatine. He is. Yeah. Oh, so that, so that could be a part of his creatinine
[1837.88s]  being relatively high. That 1.21 is way too high. But again, I don't know if that's creatine on its
[1843.04s]  own or, you know, and then creatine is proportional to muscle mass. So creatine can be higher. But if
[1849.02s]  we use that metric and Seem has probably got both you guys beat and me by far in terms of muscle mass
[1854.28s]  and density, his creatine should be off the charts, but it's not, um, EGFR plays no value on because
[1859.80s]  that, uh, algorithm, that equation is based on creatine and age chronological age. So, um,
[1867.76s]  if your creatine is relatively high, EGFR is going to be relatively low and they have EGFR equations based on
[1872.92s]  cystatin C also. So rather than using an equation that, so you could, you could have low creatine
[1879.00s]  and just because your chronological age is increasing, EGFR is going to be decreasing.
[1883.58s]  So I don't like those. I place no value in EGFR. It's, I want the actual data. So now if we're
[1890.38s]  going to assess Brian's kidney function, that's cystatin C does provide more insight because
[1895.02s]  cystatin C is, um, thought to be not proportional to muscle mass, less influenced by muscle mass in terms
[1901.14s]  of what's optimal there, less than 0.7. So lowest all cause mortality risk increases during aging.
[1907.00s]  I don't know where Brian's data was aside from this test, but when you put those two values together,
[1912.22s]  the creatine, even though it could be influenced by creatine and cystatin C 0.87 is way too high.
[1917.88s]  Now cystatin C can be impacted by diet. I know that because my cystatin C has trended upward from around
[1924.30s]  0.7 to closer to 0.8789, but then making a dietary change, I'm able to bend it back down closer to 0.7.
[1930.94s]  So, you know, it, it goes to this idea of, you know, should we, and I know Brian has always said
[1937.06s]  things like, you know, my team and I designed this diet and that's why I'm eating X, Y, and Z. Well,
[1942.52s]  your biomarkers are saying that stuff in your diet may be able to move the needle in directions to
[1947.74s]  improve your biomarkers. Are you looking into that? So, uh, I don't know what it is in his case,
[1952.00s]  because, you know, in my case, it's, um, whatever reason, sad fat, coconut butter,
[1956.76s]  cacao beans, I cut that out. All of a sudden, cystatin C reversed that six, six, five or six
[1962.00s]  blood test trend 0.74 0.75 back in that range, still a bit outside of optimal that 0.7, but, um,
[1968.28s]  cystatin C and create creatinine would suggest that Brian does have some optimal suboptimal kidney
[1972.54s]  function. Additionally, during aging, when kidney function declines, blood urea, nitrogen, or urea
[1977.34s]  will be, will increase. So urea and blood is derived exclusively from nitrogen containing compounds,
[1985.08s]  specifically amino acids coming from proteins. So even if your kidney function is normal,
[1989.82s]  if your protein intake is too high, or if your protein intake is high, you'll have high bun.
[1995.20s]  Yeah. Just, just because of protein degradation, you're just not using all of it. So then you could
[1999.96s]  say, Oh, well, maybe Brian has a very high protein intake. Well, he doesn't eat meat. I don't know if
[2004.26s]  he's supplementing with a pea protein or other vegan proteins, but it's, I find it hard to believe
[2009.88s]  that his protein intake is going to be so high and higher than seem in yours, that that would be a
[2015.56s]  cause for a higher than expected bun based on kidney function. The other side of that is his protein
[2021.24s]  intake is probably a bit lower than you guys. And his kidney function is probably a bit suboptimal
[2025.76s]  as the data suggests thereby leading to a higher than expected bun. So now bun on its own may not
[2030.98s]  seem like a big deal. So what it's urea's urea circulating in blood, but when considering that it
[2035.72s]  increases during aging and also, I, and I don't know what the value would be for everybody, but in,
[2041.00s]  in cell culture, high levels of urea degrade tight junctions. So in the intestine you have,
[2048.92s]  you know, it's a tube and then you have intestinal epithelial cells basically that make the inside of
[2053.54s]  that tube. Those epithelial cells are connected by tight junctions. So if you have high circulating
[2057.44s]  levels of urea in blood, the intestine is, is, it gets a blood supply. Urea can degrade those tight
[2063.92s]  junctions, making it easier for stuff inside the intestinal lumen, poop, microbes, microbial products,
[2069.82s]  whatever it may be to leak into the blood and activate the immune system. So how high bun has to be
[2075.52s]  to get there? Does it have to be 25, 30 is found in very old people. I don't know, but on bun, I lean
[2081.08s]  towards, you know, lower being better, you know, values where you've got it 12 or a bit less. Now just to add
[2087.48s]  one more bit of context to bun can be indeed too low because it's produced by the liver as a part of
[2094.40s]  the urea cycle. So for people who have liver disorders, bun can be very low five, six, you
[2100.56s]  know, milligrams per deciliter. This is a very rare case though, where you've got to have extreme
[2105.66s]  liver failure for that to be the case. 12 in your case is probably not liver failure or liver disease
[2110.64s]  or whatever, but it's just something to think about. Oh, my bun is seven. Well, okay. Is that because
[2115.90s]  you're not making it because something's going on with your liver or is this just a very low protein
[2120.76s]  intake? So anyway, long story short, I would agree with scene's assessment on this, that
[2124.94s]  Ryan's got some kidney related issues going on and it's probably correctable by diet. It's just a
[2130.44s]  matter of figuring out which aspects to move around to try to get that going in the right direction.
[2135.86s]  Yeah. His diet is quite atypical, I think. And so I wouldn't be surprised if there was something in
[2140.98s]  there that was causing a bit of issue. And like for all of these kidney function things,
[2145.08s]  despite his being a bit younger than myself, he's the worst on all four of these. So, okay.
[2152.06s]  Right. So as we jump in then and look at inflammation, and this is one where I'm able to
[2158.46s]  basically my inflammation never been measured as in they'd never been able to find it. We have high
[2163.76s]  sensitivity CRP here and they get down to 0.1 milligram per liter. And they basically always
[2171.30s]  tell me we can't detect any, it's below that. And then Brian has about 0.3. And then under the
[2177.16s]  inflammation, also I put the white blood cell count. I felt that fit best here, but I'm not
[2181.48s]  really that familiar with what these ranges mean. So I'll leave it for you to commentary.
[2186.62s]  Yeah. So HSCRP, all three of you guys, fantastic. It's even more fantastic that your data is
[2192.28s]  as close to zero as possible. Meta analysis shows that less than 0.3 may be optimal. So the lower,
[2199.72s]  the better for HSCRP increases during aging, higher levels associated with increased all-cause
[2204.00s]  mortality. Is there better, is it better for it to be 0.3 versus 0.05 milligrams per liter? I don't
[2210.16s]  know, but avoiding that age-related change and making sure that it stays relatively low essential.
[2215.16s]  Now for white blood cells, I find no value in looking at the absolute number because they're
[2220.62s]  not a homogeneous group of cells. In other words, up to about 97%, 95% or more for white blood cells
[2229.16s]  are neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes. Neutrophils and monocytes increase during aging,
[2233.96s]  lymphocytes decrease during aging. So your white blood cell counts could be stable and you can have
[2238.24s]  divergent things going on at the same time. So I find no value in looking at the absolute number of
[2243.76s]  white blood cells. But if we did, 3.5 to 6 would be my optimal. So Brian's would be a bit too low,
[2251.00s]  but then we could take it even a step further because people often say like, your optimal ranges
[2258.26s]  are based on sick populations. Well, first of all, I'm looking at the studies that have millions of
[2262.50s]  people, if they exist, if not millions and thousands, hundreds of thousands of people,
[2265.96s]  the biggest studies that exist, large population-based averages. Could you make a case that less
[2270.20s]  than my quote-unquote optimal range, 3.5 to 6 is optimal at the individual level for certain people?
[2275.82s]  Yeah, potentially. So could Brian's 3.1 be optimal, even though it's a bit lower than the 3.5? It could
[2282.24s]  be, but you know, it goes back to this division of the neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes.
[2288.70s]  If for example, his lymphocytes are less than a thousand, so that would be 1.0 of the 3.1. And then
[2295.64s]  his neutrophils and monocytes are say 2,000. Neutrophils and monocytes would be pretty close
[2300.18s]  to optimal in that context, but his lymphocytes being a thousand would be far away from optimal.
[2306.16s]  And we could even, I know we talked about this a bit before, but you could even subdivide the
[2310.28s]  lymphocytes into CD4, CD8, which is what's known as an immune health grade. So 1,000 lymphocytes will
[2317.24s]  be subdivided into T-cell, and I know I'm going to lose people here because of lost meat. We get into the
[2322.62s]  weeds, but this is where the beauty is. We've got to really understand that the depths and the
[2327.02s]  mechanism of our biomarkers. So the lymphocytes getting further subdivided into T-cells, B-cells,
[2331.88s]  and K-cells. If you don't have enough of certain of those cell types to fight off infection,
[2336.74s]  you're going to be more likely to get infections, stay infected for longer, increase your risk of
[2341.58s]  death from infectious mortality, and all cause mortality risk is a part of that story. So even
[2346.66s]  if his neutrophils and monocytes were quote unquote optimal, but lymphocytes were too low leading
[2351.26s]  to a worse immune health grade based on CD4, CD8, 3.1 may not be optimal. So we would need more
[2357.38s]  context to really properly evaluate if that's quote unquote optimal. But in terms of the Lusk
[2363.26s]  Garden definition of optimal, CIM and your data would probably be closer to optimal than Brian's.
[2368.46s]  I think we have some more detail on the red blood cells, but I don't think we have that neutrophil
[2373.06s]  kind of a breakdown, unfortunately. So, right. I mean, here we are with some more of the blood
[2378.58s]  counts. I mean, we have lymphocyte here breakdown. And for these as well, I'm not quite sure sort of
[2384.14s]  like how to read them. I do know that like on the hemoglobin, more is better. And I'm on the top of
[2389.70s]  this one. For the RDW, the red blood cell distribution width, if I remember correctly, this one is sort of
[2396.50s]  like you want them to have them as regularly sized as possible. And this one, mine are slightly more,
[2400.86s]  less regular than CIM and Brian. Brian coming out number one on this one.
[2404.58s]  And then the platelets or the MCV and the platelets were all comparable to these,
[2409.64s]  although I have a slightly higher platelets than the others. And then the lymphocyte percentage,
[2413.58s]  which I have is the lowest of the three of us. And you said that was important. So,
[2418.12s]  I know this is something you've been studying. So, what do you make of this?
[2422.26s]  Yeah. So, hemoglobin, 14 to 16 for men, quote unquote optimal, but 14 is not better than 15.9.
[2430.20s]  Sorry, I should say 15.9. That's the upper range. Your 15.9 is right on that border because once it's
[2435.78s]  above 16, that's a bit too high. It's associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk. Brian's
[2440.18s]  would be reason for concern for me. First, it's below that 14 to 15.9, quote unquote optimal range
[2447.26s]  based on all-cause mortality risk. But then as you mentioned, also declines during aging. And,
[2451.42s]  you know, this might be one reason why I think he mentioned something about HBOT. He's been doing
[2456.66s]  HBOT and HBOT has improved biomarkers. Well, hemoglobin carries oxygen. And if you have deficits,
[2462.72s]  well, first of all, if you have deficits in red blood cells, red blood cell number,
[2466.40s]  you're going to have lower hemoglobin because hemoglobin is found in red blood cells. Hemoglobin
[2470.38s]  carries oxygen. Your tissues aren't going to be as properly oxygenated, actually in your cells,
[2475.22s]  aren't going to be as properly oxygenated as they should be. So, HBOT within that context,
[2479.48s]  you're essentially forcing oxygen into your body and potentially improving aerobic metabolism because now
[2485.36s]  it has oxygen that it didn't have before. So, that might be part of the reason why he says things
[2490.38s]  like HBOT improves my biomarkers. Maybe it's because his hemoglobin is lower than it should be.
[2495.72s]  That said, at his chronological age, his hemoglobin is, he's got to figure out how to reverse that.
[2502.20s]  That's going in the wrong direction. Now, for the RDW, your data is a bit too high. Optimal is either
[2508.02s]  11.4, 11.5 to 12.5. So, RDW there too increases during aging, higher levels. I think once it gets to 13.7,
[2516.90s]  now we're talking all-cause mortality starts to increase. So, we've got that optimal that's up to about 12.5
[2522.26s]  and then 12.5 to 13.6, it's not significantly different than that optimal range, but then once it goes above 13.7,
[2528.30s]  now we're talking higher risk. So, RDW, it just, for people who don't know, it seems like an obscure biomarker.
[2533.94s]  It's the top predictor of Dr. Morgan Levine's biological age, clock pheno age, or the biggest
[2540.22s]  contributor to it. So, if your RDW is relatively high, your quote-unquote biological age using that
[2544.46s]  blood-based biomarker test is going to come in higher than it should be. That's just one easy way
[2548.62s]  to assess that it's something to, it's not just an obscure biomarker on a blood test report. MCV is the
[2554.98s]  average volume of your red blood cells. So, in youth, red blood cell volume is relatively small. And then
[2561.10s]  red blood cells are all, as you mentioned, homogeneous in size or in volume. So, they're
[2565.50s]  all pretty small, which that's the youthful phenotype for red blood cells. But then during aging,
[2569.56s]  that changes where the red blood cells volume starts to increase. MCV correspondingly starts to increase.
[2574.70s]  So, here too, your and Brian data would be too high. Seam is right on the money with this. My target is
[2581.02s]  close to 90. And I should say not to make this about me and to interject my stuff here, but I've actually
[2586.48s]  seen my MCV trending higher too, with my latest data being around 96. Way too high. Seam is the
[2593.04s]  champion on me.
[2594.54s]  96 seems fine to me. I don't know what you're talking about, Michael.
[2598.70s]  It's just the published data, you know? So, platelets is a J or U-shaped curve with values
[2605.68s]  around 200 being optimal. But if we look at what the all-cause mortality data is, 200 to 300 is
[2611.36s]  optimal. Lowest all-cause mortality risk. So, seam would be best here, but you could make the
[2616.38s]  argument that closest to 200 may be optimal based on the lowest portion of the J or U-shaped curve.
[2621.58s]  So, you could be actually closest to optimal. 165 would be too low. You know? So, I'd put up a red
[2627.66s]  flag on Brian. MCH is the average hemoglobin found in red blood cells. I don't track that. I don't see
[2633.06s]  the importance. That's not to say it's not important, but I see other biomarkers. You know? So, when we
[2637.50s]  think about red blood cells, most people, you know, just to bring it back to glucose and cholesterol,
[2642.76s]  right? They think of metabolic health as the most important biomarkers. But red blood cells are the
[2648.18s]  most abundant cell type in the human body, human cell type, by far. It's not even close. So, then,
[2654.22s]  so, so tracking total red blood cell numbers, hemoglobin, which is found in red blood cells,
[2658.64s]  as I mentioned, declines during aging, the MCV, their volume, and then the variability in their volume,
[2664.10s]  the RDW are the, for me, the four most important measures to be tracking with respect to red blood
[2669.00s]  cells and overall red blood cell, you know, health and, you know, function, functionality,
[2674.22s]  essentially. So, now, last step, lymphocyte percentage, I would have put that in the white
[2679.36s]  blood cell, you know, potentially inflammation. But, but here we can kind of address that,
[2684.40s]  that question of, is Brian's 3.1, is that potentially too low? Because his, his 38% lymphocytes,
[2692.50s]  so if you do 38.38 times 3.1, so now we're looking at a total lymphocyte count that's probably,
[2699.12s]  so what is that, four, 1300, 1300 lymphocytes. So, if we just look at CD4 and CD8, they should
[2705.02s]  probably be about 800 and 400, but then that doesn't include B cell or NK cells. So, if your
[2711.54s]  CD4s aren't greater than 800, now you're in immune health grade two, which is immune health grade one
[2717.38s]  is most likely to be found in young people, seems age. So, this would suggest his total lymphocytes
[2722.28s]  are on the lower side and not a part of the youngest immune health grade. Now, is that the,
[2728.72s]  the, the, is that for all of his tests? Is this just one test? You know, we'd have to get more data
[2733.72s]  to find out. Hmm, right. Okay. So, it does seem to track then. Hmm. Well, he's living a quite ascetic
[2741.70s]  life, so probably, maybe. Okay. Um, let's see. In the lipid panel, this one's going to be
[2746.92s]  interesting, I think. Uh, my, uh, uh, numbers in this are quite far out of range in several places.
[2753.74s]  Um, so we start out with the APOB, um, which is sort of an LDL, um, correlate. And, uh, for this one,
[2760.98s]  uh, my numbers are basically a bit, uh, higher than the other two. Uh, I think I probably eat a
[2767.58s]  messier diet. Although I know Sim, uh, is not vegan, uh, not vegetarian. He does eat meat from
[2772.90s]  time to time. I have friends who love to do barbecue and I love to eat the barbecue. So,
[2777.62s]  um, I do have red meat from time to time, uh, and also have, uh, milk with my coffee, uh, every day.
[2784.12s]  Um, then on the APOA one, and this is a, an HDL correlate, uh, I'm off the charts on this one.
[2790.38s]  So, usually they'll look at APOA one and HDL and say, well, it should be high and over 40 or so for
[2796.80s]  HDL is good. Um, but I'm way at the 227. Um, on the HDLC, uh, you can see there that as opposed to
[2804.90s]  being over 40, I'm 113. I mean, I think it actually is okay. Um, I can go ahead and jump ahead to the
[2812.52s]  next one. There are three things that can raise your HDLs, um, or your APOA one, uh, one is, uh,
[2819.00s]  over is strength training. Uh, the second one is alcohol consumption. And the third one is walking
[2824.72s]  and other exercise. And I do all three of those. Um, my strength training, I do it for about 30,
[2831.04s]  about an hour or so a week. Um, right within range, healthy range, not doing too much, not doing too
[2836.54s]  little. Uh, for the alcohol consumption, I have about, I have exactly one drink of about 200,
[2841.66s]  uh, milliliters of wine at night, uh, every day. Um, but two or three days a week, I'll go out with
[2848.16s]  friends and have three or four drinks. Um, so that maybe is a little bit of an increase,
[2852.96s]  but I don't consider myself a heavy drinker. Um, but then on the walking, I am absolutely a heavy
[2858.52s]  walker. So I have a walking desk, uh, in some of our earlier videos, I walked throughout the entire
[2863.92s]  video. I'll walk 20,000, 30,000 steps a day without really noticing it. And, um, there's a chart here.
[2871.56s]  We'll, I'll jump ahead to this, um, where basically we can see that the more steps that you walk,
[2876.60s]  the higher HDL is. And this is pretty much a linear correlation, right? So you can see here
[2882.22s]  that basically my, uh, 20,000 steps a day are causing my high HDLs. So given that we know that,
[2890.80s]  uh, more steps is actually, um, although there's a diminishing return after about 10 or 12,000 steps
[2897.20s]  where you're not getting much more benefit from it, we know at least it's not, uh, it doesn't have a U
[2902.02s]  shape curve or it doesn't become bad for you at any point that we've seen in the charts.
[2905.80s]  So I think my HDL, even though very high above the range, in fact, I went to an, an HDL calculator
[2912.26s]  to figure out what was sort of a healthy range before. And I plugged in 113 from my HDL and it
[2917.54s]  bounced right back at me with an error saying invalid answer, please change your HDL value,
[2922.96s]  which is a little, um, a little bit frustrating, but, um, I think that it's, it's fine given that I
[2928.86s]  know the cause of it, which is the walking steps as opposed to having an alcohol problem or,
[2933.60s]  uh, lifting more than an hour a week, which I think is the optimum level. Uh, total cholesterol,
[2939.60s]  given the HDL then is, uh, above what would be normal. Um, but that is mostly the HDL content.
[2945.98s]  Uh, the triglycerides here, um, as you noted before are quite low for me. In fact, my recent test,
[2951.94s]  they came back as 38. Um, so they've even dropped down from the 54 ahead of the time. And the LPA1,
[2957.48s]  which you've, uh, talked about quite interestingly in some of your videos as being a mostly genetic
[2962.28s]  thing, although you've been able to move yours, uh, materially. Um, I have good genetics for this
[2967.02s]  one at a 12.3, which gives me a good hope that all of these are going to be fine.
[2972.16s]  Yeah. So our weight, so I guess we, I want to start at total cholesterol. Um, so total cholesterol for me
[2978.50s]  is kind of like the white blood cell story because total cholesterol is not homogeneous. You've got,
[2983.60s]  you know, HDL going in one direction, cardioprotective versus, um, the ApoB containing
[2988.58s]  lipoproteins, LDL, lipoprotein A, VLDL going in the other. So I find no value in looking at total
[2994.00s]  cholesterol, the individual lipoproteins and ApoB, I find the most value. So, um, so that's one.
[2999.86s]  So two, if you can go forward to the, uh, HDL, if you can go forward one slide,
[3004.80s]  if you look at extrapolation of the trend line, even up to 20,000 steps per day,
[3010.32s]  that's probably about 1.6 millimolar on average, right? So, um, one millimolar is about 40 milligrams
[3017.66s]  per deciliter, which means that if you're walking 20,000 steps per day, the average expected HDL based
[3022.70s]  on this plot, and you can even see the, the gray is the 95% confidence interval. So at the highest
[3027.92s]  you'd expect to see HDL 65, 70. So I don't know that this is the major factor in your case for higher
[3034.28s]  HDL. It may be a part of that story, but based on this, your HDL would be 50 milligrams per deciliter
[3041.62s]  lower. Now, can you go, can you go back? So unfortunately, yeah, go ahead.
[3046.32s]  No, no. So I was going to say, um, yeah, so, um, I have all three of those factors. So as you say,
[3051.70s]  like that in and of itself is not enough to explain it. Although then I figured that if you add on top
[3056.90s]  of that, uh, regular moderate alcohol consumption, and then on top of that, I do an hour of weight
[3062.54s]  lifting, but as we've talked about before, it's pretty hardcore. It's a full on squats and all,
[3067.48s]  all the exercise, the entire exercise time is based on, uh, multi muscle movements, but.
[3072.58s]  So your weight weightlifting may be a part of the story where for whatever reason, you're
[3076.94s]  sensitive to producing more HDL within that context, but, and I'm not happy to say it, but,
[3082.44s]  and I don't know how much alcohol is contributing to it, but how would you know when HDL is indeed too
[3087.36s]  high? So if you look at the all cause mortality data, it's a J or U shaped curve, actually probably
[3092.86s]  closer to U shape, whereas you mentioned less than 40 higher risk. Then once you get above 70,
[3097.74s]  also higher risk. So, um, APOA1 tracks with the HDL story because APOA1 is found almost exclusively
[3105.08s]  on HDL. It can be freely floating in plasma, but if it's in blood, it's almost exclusively coming from
[3111.36s]  HDL. And I, I know that not just because of the, you know, published mechanism and that it's, you know,
[3117.44s]  found on HDL, but I've measured APOA1 and HDL and looked at the correlation over seven tests
[3122.86s]  and the correlation coefficient is greater than 0.9. So I, I actually stopped measuring APOA1
[3128.04s]  and just, uh, I'm only focused on HDL. There's no need to measure them both. So if you look at the
[3132.64s]  quote unquote optimal range for HDL, 50 to 69 men and women, this is a study of like 12 million people
[3138.42s]  or more. Um, I don't remember the exact actual number. It was greater than 10 million, but so,
[3142.88s]  okay, let's bypass that. Let's look at APOA1. Well, in a small study, I think this study was about
[3147.22s]  300,000 people. All cause mortality for APOA1 was lowest for 150 to 180 milligrams per
[3152.76s]  desolated. All right. What about greater than 180? Well, although lowest risk was that 150 to 180,
[3157.86s]  all cause mortality risk went away at greater than 180. So you essentially lost the lower,
[3165.36s]  lowering of all cause mortality risk at values greater than 180. So in your case, I'd say that's
[3170.16s]  the best case scenario. I don't think your HDL is going to be associated with a higher all cause
[3173.94s]  mortality risk when considering APOA1, but there's another factor to consider. So HDL, high HDL,
[3180.32s]  you know, cardio, cardio protective. So then why, or in within what context with high HDL be
[3186.80s]  potentially bad for health and or longevity? Well, we're considering that as you mentioned,
[3191.22s]  alcohol can raise it and knowing that, and I'm not saying you're an alcoholic by no means. I'm not
[3194.88s]  saying that I'm sure you're not moderate alcohol intake, but, um, for people who are alcoholics,
[3199.76s]  HDL is dramatically high. And within that context, they've got damage to liver enzymes. GGT is
[3205.96s]  relatively high ASD, ALT. So could that be a part of your story where maybe you wouldn't die from
[3211.58s]  cardiovascular disease, but maybe some liver related issues. Could you clean up your liver
[3215.78s]  related issues with train, you know, not blood testing the day before the hard workout. And now
[3221.00s]  GGT is less than 12, ASD, ALT closer to the, you know, low twenties. And then the HDL story doesn't
[3227.30s]  become a liver health story. It's just, okay, well it's maybe it's a bit too much wine where I'm losing
[3232.86s]  the lowering of all cause mortality risk just being outside of that one 80. So, so that would
[3237.14s]  be the context for that, uh, April B less than 70. So it's interesting because if you look at blood
[3242.70s]  test reports, they'll say like less than 80 for primary prevention, you know, so these are people
[3247.16s]  who have, uh, or, or, or diagnosed CBD less than 80, less than 70 for primary prevention. They get really
[3253.16s]  strict once people have preexisting CBD. But if you look at, um, studies in the general population,
[3258.66s]  less than 76 lowest CHD mortality risk, and then all cause mortality data actually less than 70.
[3265.90s]  So these are people who don't have preexisting CBD. So the reference ranges are behind, behind the
[3270.70s]  times. Now here too, this is a bit, you know, Brian's a bit of a juicing here. You know, he's,
[3276.46s]  he's on some PDs where he's taking a statin. So his 70 right at that quote unquote, lust garden
[3281.74s]  optimal he he's juicing, right? He's taking, uh, you know, a statin to lower it. And would that be as
[3287.64s]  beneficial if he could do it naturally? I know seems not on a statin. So I'd actually place the
[3291.58s]  greatest value on seems 58 relative to Brian. You'd be a bit too high. Now you could say, all right,
[3297.50s]  if, if, if optimal is 70 and you know, potentially the slowest progression of CBD is going to be, uh,
[3303.66s]  less than 70, what's the CBD, what's the atherosclerosis progression rate for someone at 80 or 90 versus
[3309.32s]  70. Is it 1% per year, 0.1% per year, but even at a very slow rate, you know, ideally we want it to be
[3316.60s]  flat at the lowest, right? So trying to get it lower than 70 would be optimal. And I, it's easily,
[3322.46s]  you know, you mentioned eating barbecue and I think it's probably full fat dairy that's going in that
[3327.38s]  coffee. Uh, you know, it's not, oh, it's low fat. So April B is pretty easy to reduce for most people.
[3334.90s]  Um, sad fat, higher sad fat will increase it, but then there's, there are published RCTs where if you
[3341.36s]  increase soluble fiber and total fiber intake, super high, April B comes down very fast within
[3346.66s]  two weeks. So cutting sad fat and increasing fiber intake, how high people may need, may need to go.
[3352.28s]  Is that from 30 grams of fiber to 40 grams, probably not may have to double it or go even higher. But
[3357.72s]  for people who are struggling with April B it's, it's a relatively easy biomarker to move the needle on.
[3363.44s]  Um, triglycerides, I mentioned less than 45. If you go by all cause mortality data, less than 90 would
[3369.42s]  be optimal. The reference range has less than one 50, but if you look at CHD mortality risk,
[3374.44s]  it's less than 45. So here too, it's, it's, it's 55 materially worse than 45. Is that a 1 0.1%,
[3382.70s]  you know, over time increase for atherosclerosis progression. I don't know, but my target is
[3388.66s]  getting it to less than 45. I'm in the ballpark of where you and, and, uh, Brian are 55, 60, uh,
[3394.70s]  depending on my diet composition, if it's higher carb actually goes to 70. So, uh, I'm still
[3399.24s]  working on the recipe to get it consistently less than 45 and lipoprotein a last but not least,
[3403.70s]  even though it's, as you mentioned, it's genetic marker and thought to be, you know, resistant to
[3407.82s]  change. From my experience, as you mentioned, it's definitely malleable. How low you can get
[3412.60s]  is debatable though. I've never had values where Brian being the high end of this range is in terms
[3418.10s]  of what's optimal there. Although lower should be better. Um, there are published studies where it's
[3423.84s]  just not associated with all cause mortality risk. But on the other hand, there are studies showing
[3428.34s]  that it's six to seven times more atherogenic than LDL and triglycerides are approximately two
[3434.38s]  times more atherogenic than LDL. So the way I'm thinking about this now is so APL-B consists of
[3440.60s]  LDL, lipoprotein A, VLDL, and IDL. IDL is almost never measured. It's a very small fraction. So we can
[3447.92s]  essentially boil APL-B down into those first three, LDL, lipoprotein A, um, VLDL. So if your
[3455.64s]  APL-B is less than 70 quote unquote optimum, if the major fraction of that is coming from
[3460.50s]  lipoprotein A and VLDL or triglycerides, so triglycerides divided by five is a very close
[3466.12s]  approximation to VLDL. So if your APL-B is coming almost exclusively from lipoprotein A and VLDL
[3472.36s]  and less from LDL, that's actually going to be a worse cardiovascular disease profile,
[3477.52s]  even at very low APL-B. So making sure that it's not just about low APL-B,
[3484.28s]  it's making sure that lipoprotein A is as low as you can get it, VLDL as low as you can get it.
[3489.04s]  And then within the context of low APL-B, higher, relatively higher LDL. So easier said than done,
[3494.86s]  my lipoprotein A is higher than it should be actually even higher than Brian's. Um,
[3499.50s]  because that's in millimolar, my millimolar is like 80, 75, 80 consistently, but my, you know,
[3505.06s]  so, so I've got to work on figuring out how to get that even lower, but, but all right,
[3509.64s]  just to add a little more context. So fortunately there is stuff for people like me and you guys
[3514.38s]  aren't in this boat. Um, you know, your, uh, seam is the best of the bunch there, but so even if
[3519.42s]  someone's got relatively high lipoprotein A, 75, 80, uh, nanomolar or more having HSCRP less than
[3525.42s]  two milligrams per liter, not 0.2 that, uh, essentially the, uh, CHD mortality risk goes away.
[3531.32s]  So, but if you've got high HSCRP, the risk increases based on CHD risk based on lipoprotein A,
[3538.06s]  and then also the waist to hip ratio. So when waist to hip ratio is less than 0.93,
[3543.18s]  it's not associated with an increased risk of lipoprotein A associated CBD outcomes. But for
[3548.12s]  people who had a waist to hip ratio greater than one, and I've got a video commenting on,
[3551.76s]  actually, I released it today. Uh, it's on YouTube today, but, um, but so for people who have a
[3558.22s]  waist to hip ratio greater than one, lipoprotein A higher than 50 milligrams per deciliter, which
[3563.58s]  would be 125 nanomolar way off the charts compared to you, the three of you guys that's associated
[3568.50s]  with an increased CBD mortality, uh, outcome risk. Whereas people with lipoprotein A less than 50
[3574.10s]  milligrams per deciliter and 125 nanomolar with a waist to hip ratio less than 0.93, no association
[3579.98s]  with CBD mortality related outcomes. So there may be for people who have hot, relatively high lipoprotein
[3586.06s]  A ways to modulate that risk by keeping inflammation low and waist to hip ratio low.
[3591.42s]  But anyway, context. Yeah, that's, uh, it's interesting. I hadn't, uh, thought of doing
[3596.96s]  sort of the math to break down below the, uh, cholesterol. I mean, the thing everyone sees is
[3601.78s]  the LDL and the HDL and then breaking that into the LPA, um, out of the LDL. Interesting.
[3607.74s]  Yeah. This is hard. This is why I get paid the big bucks. You know, it's, uh,
[3610.58s]  yes. Yeah. Get into the numbers deeper, deeper and, you know, get more correlations.
[3615.70s]  Okay. Uh, so let's see, um, uh, continuing on sort of metabolic, metabolic health. So I find this
[3622.44s]  one interesting and this is actually one of my, um, wishes for Levine's age, uh, calculator,
[3628.78s]  which you use, uh, very effectively. Uh, unfortunately the data set that he, my understanding
[3633.12s]  is the data set that he used to calculate his, uh, make his calculator with only had fasting glucose.
[3639.22s]  It didn't have HbA1c available for all of the data points. Um, because HbA1c is, I'm sure you're
[3646.94s]  aware, is a longer indicator of sort of your overall, uh, blood sugar level. So I'm, I'm quite,
[3652.30s]  uh, happy with this one. Uh, although, uh, Brian's team and myself are all in quite a tight range around
[3658.26s]  the pretty optimal level of 5.1%. Um, fasting glucose, um, 86, kind of generally useful here.
[3666.50s]  On homocysteum, a bit higher on this one. I know that yourself and some other people have done some
[3670.78s]  interventions with, uh, vitamin B, if I remember correctly, to lower this. Honestly, I, I haven't
[3676.86s]  really tried to address this or do anything with it. Um, so I'm kind of just let it as it is. I
[3682.12s]  figured my LPA1 and the other things that I had would be enough to protect from the CVD,
[3686.32s]  which is to understand what this is the concern for. And then for the uric acid, uh,
[3690.72s]  Seam and I are about the same in this one, uh, Brian Johnson. Although it's not exactly clear
[3695.22s]  whether lower is better on this one. I think it's more of a range than anything else.
[3698.94s]  All right. Wait. So HBA1C, uh, five to 6% based on, uh, lowest all cause mortality risk,
[3705.16s]  but then lower is found in youth increases during aging as close to five as possible.
[3710.06s]  So all three of you guys pretty great. Even seems 4.9. I'm not, I'm not going to,
[3714.82s]  you know, nitpick over 4.9 versus 5.0. Probably fantastic. I see more value in HBA1C,
[3720.34s]  as you mentioned, just because it's a longer term marker up to about 120 days. And I say up to,
[3724.46s]  because that's an average, right? Red blood cells can live shorter than 120 days and they can live
[3728.46s]  longer, um, which can affect HBA1C measurements. So I see that as a better measure than fasting
[3733.36s]  glucose. So I'm not worried about Brian's 97 because his HBA1C is 5.1 optimal for glucose,
[3739.64s]  80 to 94 being closer to 80 being optimal. So, you know, I see, yeah, Brian's 5.1 is probably okay
[3746.86s]  within that 97 context. Homocysteine in your case, I'd, I'd be, that'd be something I'd be trying to
[3751.84s]  reduce. So even though, so the argument against homocysteine lowering is that whenever I raise it
[3757.14s]  as a biomarker, people are like, well, look at primary prevention trials that try to lower
[3760.74s]  homocysteine. It didn't improve CBD related outcomes. And then my retort to that is, okay,
[3766.02s]  yeah, in the short term, but CBD is a long-term process. You know, these intervention trials,
[3770.20s]  maybe they're six months, a year, two months at most, are you really impacting CBD related outcomes?
[3775.28s]  If you're reducing homocysteine for a, you know, up to a two-year period, but it's been elevated for
[3780.46s]  30 years when CBD has happened, right? So, so that's one side of that story. The other is that
[3784.72s]  it's in, uh, in vitro in cell, in cell culture models, it's neurotoxic and it causes, uh, endothelial
[3791.98s]  cell senescence. So this is a big one in my mind. The question of how to reduce it is not, not so
[3796.88s]  simple. Most people, every time I make homocysteine video, I get comments like trimethylglycine,
[3802.44s]  uh, betaine, you know, that, that brings it down for me and it could work, you know? Um, but that's
[3808.06s]  not the only place to look because there are many ways to lower homocysteine. In my case, I've
[3812.10s]  supplemented with four or up to five grams per day, no dent on homocysteine. So figuring out where the
[3818.34s]  weak link is in that methylation chain, it's not just, it may not just be about B vitamins. It could
[3823.34s]  be, you know, uh, other methyl donors are lacking that are not donating that methyl group to homocysteine to
[3828.84s]  convert it into methine. So, um, yeah, my target is actually closer to where SEMA is at around five.
[3834.26s]  Um, and then uric acid, uh, you mentioned, you know, not knowing if, if, uh, uh, I think you said
[3839.04s]  something like that, what's optimal there for longevity. So there's a study that was done on
[3843.42s]  the odds of living to a hundred years in association with uric acid levels. And actually 4.2 was right at
[3849.20s]  that cutoff. So values less than 4.2 milligrams per deciliter were associated with about a twofold
[3855.32s]  higher odds. Now, granted, this was like 4% versus 2% of living to a hundred, but still it's people who
[3861.94s]  had uric acid levels of less than 4.2 had a higher odds of living to a hundred. Now, you know, this may
[3867.16s]  actually be good news for, uh, Brian because he's got values of 4.2 uric acid levels are inversely
[3873.42s]  proportional to EGFR. So worse kidney function, uric acid should increase. So if Brian does have some
[3879.36s]  amount of poor kidney function, I'd expect higher than expected uric acid levels. The other side of that
[3884.08s]  is uric acid levels can increase with a high meat diet, even alcohol, which I know are not a part
[3889.26s]  of Brian's diet, which may suggest that maybe limiting the dietary precursors for uric acid or
[3894.92s]  helping him keep it low, even within the context of suboptimal kidney function. But yeah, 5.2, 5.1
[3901.54s]  is far from terrible. I mean, it's associated with lowest all cause mortality risk, but less than 4.2 is
[3906.40s]  my target based on the centenarian data. Okay. Yeah. I'm not sure how to, to move this, um, one. I'm
[3911.94s]  quite happy with the HbA1c. That's one of my, uh, key metrics, um, along with the Hscrp,
[3918.10s]  the overall inflammation, the HbA1c is the metabolic health. I think these are fundamental.
[3922.96s]  Um, then in the, sort of once again, taking a step away from the direct blood tests on the
[3928.06s]  VO2max, all three of us are quite exceptional on these things. Um, to see him at 66, although he's a
[3935.08s]  younger chap, younger lad. Mine is currently, uh, 58, 48. The last time I checked it, uh, which was when I just,
[3941.94s]  was having a trip back to the States where there's good machines there available for testing it.
[3945.92s]  Although when I was training for the marathon, it was 61.5. Um, so, uh, when I'm in, uh, full on,
[3953.42s]  uh, giving it all I've got, it's quite a bit higher than this. Uh, it's not necessary. And I'm quite
[3958.08s]  happy with a day to day of 58. My blood pressure at a 121 over 78, uh, is a little higher than I'd
[3965.10s]  like it to be. I've been working with taking potassium to lower this cause I don't want to eat vegetables
[3971.94s]  resting heart rate. Uh, all of us are quite low, uh, heart rate variability at the time was 50.
[3977.26s]  Since I did this test now, it's more like around in the 60, 70 rate, uh, as it sort of increased.
[3982.92s]  Um, I don't know, just as I've, uh, been tuning my overall fitness and reducing the number of days
[3987.84s]  that I work out. As you know, this is quite responsive to whether you're overloaded in your
[3991.54s]  training or not.
[3992.60s]  Yeah. So most of this is great news. So VO2max, you know, I get it's important,
[3999.20s]  you know, declines during aging, but here too, when you think about what we're actually looking
[4003.06s]  at, it's your maximum ability to consume oxygen under physiologic stress. I just don't know how
[4009.00s]  functionally related that is to just everyday life, right? Sure. Sure. If you're trying to run
[4014.18s]  for hours or run for miles important, but you know, we're not operating at VO2 max. Now you could say,
[4020.36s]  all right, it declines during aging. If you live long enough, your VO2 max will decline to the point
[4024.14s]  where you can't breathe and you can't make any energy. Yep. Okay.
[4027.26s]  Yeah. So, so for sure. But if you look at, if you look at all cause mortality data,
[4031.72s]  it's like greater than anything, greater than 50 is lowest risk is having a VO2 max of 65,
[4037.54s]  better than 50 maybe. Um, but even the, the groups, you know, that were close to 50, 40 to 50,
[4043.74s]  you know, all cause mortality risk was still dramatically reduced relative to someone who's
[4047.42s]  sedentary. So I think here too, just like the, uh, you know, bench press and, and other strength
[4052.36s]  measures, the absolute number, as long as you're above 40, 40 ish, not that important in my, in my
[4057.52s]  opinion, but resisting age related change, uh, a big part of that story. Also too, you know, what VO2 max
[4063.18s]  doesn't really capture is, you know, like sprinting or reaction time. I mean, granted you'd expect
[4068.12s]  someone with a high VO2 max to be able to, you know, sprint relatively fast, but they're not necessarily
[4072.92s]  similar because you know, the marathon runners are not in a hundred meter dash, right? It's two
[4077.84s]  different types of athlete and even body types, you know, sprinting may not seem like a big deal,
[4081.54s]  but if you're walking down the street and your reaction time is poor because of old age and you
[4085.56s]  can't move out of the way. So anyway, I see value in, in not just VO2 max, but other aspects of,
[4091.04s]  of, uh, anaerobic fitness to BP one 20 over 80 is associated with lowest risk. There is obviously
[4097.56s]  data in younger people where average blood pressure is a hundred over 60, but here to avoiding
[4102.18s]  age related change is important, which goes beyond one test, you know, one test measurement,
[4105.82s]  you know, was your data one 15 over 75 and now it's one 20 over 80, right? I mean,
[4110.36s]  that's a big one. And blood pressure is I'm measuring it. I've measured it the last three
[4113.90s]  days in a row. I'm measuring it at least, you know, 10 times a month. I really have to increase my,
[4118.08s]  my 10 times a month may not seem like a lot, or it may seem like a lot to some people, but
[4121.84s]  my dad is, uh, 83 and he just started blood pressure meds. So I may have some genetic
[4128.52s]  predisposition to, uh, you know, it, and my averages have been about one 20 over 80, uh,
[4135.32s]  more recently. So this is a big one. And most people aren't thinking about it in terms of CBD
[4139.70s]  risk. You know, they're thinking about lipoproteins and insulin sensitivity, but people who have,
[4145.50s]  uh, there, there's a study I haven't, I haven't made a video about yet, but BP is on that list for,
[4151.06s]  um, you know, most likely related to having a CBD event is having relatively high blood pressure
[4156.96s]  and it doesn't have to be one 50 over a hundred. It can be one 30 over 80 increases risk. So BP is a
[4162.12s]  big one and it's easy to measure. It's, I get that it's time consuming and it sucks to have to sit
[4166.16s]  there for 30 minutes, relax for 10 minutes, measure it every couple of minutes to take an average.
[4170.24s]  But I mean, it's, it's, it's an easy biomarker to measure.
[4173.70s]  Yeah. I can't, I can't, I can't, uh, like I just find it to be too boring. I do like a five minute
[4178.68s]  waiting thing and then take my blood pressure and wait a minute and take it again. Although, um, uh,
[4183.38s]  one of the things that I've talked about on my blog, I mean, I think there's a definite cheat code
[4186.92s]  for blood pressure. Um, it's about three times as effective to increase your potassium as it is
[4192.52s]  to decrease salt. And, uh, they've been saying decreased salt for blood pressure for decades,
[4197.44s]  ever since the DASH study came out, which, um, if you follow the literature, the DASH study was a
[4204.00s]  huge outlier in the effectiveness they had of that. That was not able to be replicated in the amount of,
[4210.60s]  uh, reduction in salt they had versus the blood pressure, uh, results. But, uh, I find it to be much
[4215.74s]  more effective to increase the potassium intake, which you can do, uh, natural sources would be
[4220.34s]  like bananas and other things, but also you can get a powder that you can just take, um, in dosage
[4225.56s]  that then gets you to the few grams or so that you would need a day to reduce it. And I found that
[4229.94s]  takes down my blood pressure by about five off of the, uh, the, uh, systolic number and two or so off
[4236.62s]  of the diastolic. And my blood pressure is already in good range. I think those effect would be greater
[4241.00s]  if you had a higher blood pressure to start with. So carry on, you were about to talk about
[4244.94s]  resting heart rate. No way. So that that's good. That's a great point. So increasing potassium and
[4249.40s]  lowering sodium is probably the lowest hanging fruit. So just along those lines though, note that
[4253.70s]  my average potassium intake, cause my diet is abundant in vegetables and especially potassium
[4259.38s]  containing vegetables. When I'm talking about like, I don't want to spend my whole day eating
[4263.64s]  fruits and vegetables. Wait a minute. That's what Mike does every day. You know me. I don't, I don't get,
[4268.58s]  I don't get triggered, but, um, so I'm on 7,000 milligrams on average, about 7,000 milligrams
[4273.94s]  of potassium per day. The AHA American Heart Association, I mean, their recommendation is like
[4278.58s]  4,800 milligrams per day. And I've actually been a lot higher for potassium, but, and that's on the
[4283.62s]  context of around 2,200 milligrams of sodium per day. So I'm, I'm at AHA or better targets and yet
[4291.16s]  blood pressure is not a hundred over 60. So there may be, that would always be the first place to
[4294.76s]  start increased potassium, lower sodium. And if you look at the published studies, it's right in line
[4298.38s]  with what you said of higher sodium diets, even very high five, six grams per day. If you cut that
[4303.54s]  down, like to, uh, you know, the lowest end of the sodium intake range, the, it's only about a five
[4308.88s]  mm HG difference, you know, for very high versus very low. So it's right in line with what you're
[4313.34s]  saying. Some people may get a bigger impact than that, but there too, I've been playing with my sodium
[4318.44s]  intake because I've gone a bit higher intentionally, 2,700. Now I'm cutting it back down 22. And I may go back
[4324.56s]  down to 1,800 because sodium is a part of the sodium can impact the stress response, including
[4329.74s]  norepinephrine. So if your sodium intakes are actually too low, like 1300 per day, norepinephrine
[4335.96s]  can be higher. And why that's important is because norepinephrine is a marker of chronic stress.
[4341.34s]  Norepinephrine negatively impacts the next two values on the list, resting heart rate and heart
[4344.70s]  rate variability. So then it raises the question of how much sodium intake is optimal for lowering
[4350.52s]  systemic levels of norepinephrine and potentially allowing for highest heart rate variability and
[4355.92s]  lower resting heart rate, but without messing up blood pressure. So I've been doing that experiment,
[4360.16s]  my blood pressure, I'd rather have the blood pressure improvements and, you know, keep it on
[4364.36s]  the lower side. So, okay. So resting heart rate is an interesting one because inverse U during aging,
[4369.12s]  relatively low in youth and older ages, it couldn't be hard to discern with a peak at midlife.
[4374.68s]  So heart rate variability breaks that tie. So HRV is very high in youth and then it declines
[4380.20s]  pretty steadily over, over a lifespan. So at older ages, you'd expect to see a relatively low
[4386.30s]  resting heart rate, but a low HRV. Whereas at younger ages and fit people, very high HRV,
[4392.34s]  very low resting heart rate. I mean, seems data is a perfect example of that. So now people then often
[4398.74s]  say, oh, it's genetic. My HRV is terrible. It's always been terrible. It can be improved. Can you get
[4404.50s]  your HRV from 50 to 90? I mean, I know you saw changes during marathon training. And as you mentioned,
[4410.76s]  balancing activity versus rest, it goes up. It's for me, it's not so much the absolute numbers are
[4415.98s]  important. High HRV, low resting heart rate. It's important, but moving it within one's own genetic
[4421.80s]  maximum. So if you're starting off with an HRV of 35, if you can get that to 60, maybe you can't get it to
[4427.42s]  a hundred within the context of a low resting heart rate, but figuring out that recipe to get it there.
[4432.46s]  And then also avoiding the age-related change. So lowering your resting heart rate over time,
[4437.30s]  but improving your HRV, getting it closest to that more youthful profile. And I know we've talked
[4443.32s]  about this in previous pods, but the idea of how is it that exercise is good for average,
[4450.42s]  but not maximal lifespan. And I think chronic overtraining is a part of that phenotype or
[4455.72s]  getting the exercise prescription slightly wrong. Because when you think about function predicting
[4461.10s]  health span, which should predict longevity, if you're overdoing exercise by a bit,
[4466.36s]  and you've got chronically, you're chronically stressed, whether through norepinephrine or lower
[4471.36s]  HRV and higher resting heart rate, I'd imagine that's going to be bad for some measure of
[4475.92s]  lifespan. Is that a one or two year change? Is that a 10 year change? I don't know.
[4479.74s]  But if we can keep HRV high and resting heart rate low function as high as possible, my bet,
[4485.40s]  and there's no published data on this, nobody's done a study on it. This is my speculation,
[4488.50s]  is that we'd be able to push the longevity promoting effects of exercise from just an
[4493.56s]  increase in average to closer to the maximal. So I look at HRV resting heart rate as essential
[4498.76s]  in this equation. I think that's a perfect segue here as we look at sort of the, well, here we go to the
[4505.18s]  aging biomarkers. So afterwards, I'll talk about the exercise. But before we get to that, this is
[4511.38s]  something that I honestly don't put a whole lot of weight on, although the phenotype reduction,
[4516.18s]  which you're doing extending at is at the bottom of this. The Dunnenden pace, I mean,
[4522.40s]  Sim also has kind of cast some shade on this. And I have to agree with him on this is that it's,
[4526.96s]  it's, it's kind of a manufactured benchmark that then they measure against. And the people who make
[4534.06s]  the Dunnenden pace themselves say that we find no benefit of doing exercise or eating a healthy diet on
[4540.74s]  our own metric. So that for me, I'm like, okay, those are the most powerful things that we have.
[4545.32s]  If you say that your metric shows them to be of no use, I have no use for your metric. And it's
[4551.18s]  quite expensive. It's around like, I don't know, several hundred dollars to take. I've done it twice.
[4555.94s]  The first time I was at 0.8. I was like, okay, well, the second time was at 0.98. I don't know why
[4562.46s]  there seems to be a lot of variability in it. Brian Johnson takes this a lot. He puts quite a bit of,
[4567.80s]  he's got the Olympics and stuff that he competes on. Telomere length, I don't know. I mean,
[4572.48s]  it's supposed to be more is supposed to be better, but mine is quite low, but that's the,
[4577.42s]  it's supposed to be a cancer prevention marker or something that goes down as you age for sure,
[4582.48s]  but I don't know. The phenolage reduction, this then is tracking back into some of the things I
[4587.62s]  think are quite important, like the, I mean, not the HbA1c like I would prefer, but the glucose,
[4592.70s]  the CRP, which is the inflammation marker, the albumin, which you mentioned, the red blood cell
[4597.76s]  distribution width and other things. So I think it's useful, although many of the things that I've
[4602.40s]  talked about here would not be affected or reflected in that at all. And I think are quite
[4606.58s]  important, like the VO2 max or grip strength and other things.
[4610.18s]  Yeah. So, so the epigenetics, that's an interesting one, right? Because when you think about genetics,
[4615.74s]  genetics is the prediction for what can happen. Epigenetics is one step above that, where you're not
[4621.54s]  looking at the genetics, you're looking at methylation marks on your genome, which then determine
[4626.18s]  if genes are turned on or off. So there too, it's a prediction. It's not a measure of what's
[4631.98s]  actually happening in terms of the, what's actually happening, how they derive the algorithm.
[4636.04s]  It's a epigen, it's an epigenetic prediction of 19 clinical chemistry biomarkers, including
[4641.42s]  HSCRP, HbA1c, ApoB, waist to hip ratio, oral health. So, but it's still a prediction of actual biomarkers.
[4651.18s]  So I measured Donita Pace. I used True Diagnostics and I love their company. I love their leadership.
[4657.86s]  It's not a knock on them. I got, I got tired of looking the prediction of real stuff and I'm just
[4663.22s]  focused on the real stuff. So I added HbA1c into the approach, you know, for basically the same cost,
[4668.30s]  I added the actual biomarkers. Now in your case, so in terms of how good or not that it is,
[4674.88s]  you know, so Matt Kaberlein and Seam have kind of poo-pooed on epigenetic testing as a whole, but
[4681.00s]  it's important to know that all epigenetic tests are not the same. There are many epigenetic tests
[4685.80s]  that exist that are not based in published literature that are just giving you a biological
[4691.30s]  age. And this isn't just epigenetic clocks. It's other clocks too, that companies are using. And
[4695.08s]  they'll say, even Whoop has a, your biological age is X. Well, what is that based on? Show me your
[4700.18s]  algorithm, publish the data. Let's see how good it is because if someone's epigenetic or any biological
[4705.82s]  age test is not significantly correlated with chronological age, for example, Dunedin-Pace's
[4711.54s]  correlation with chronological age is only like 0.3, very weak. Whereas Pheno age, which includes
[4716.28s]  said nine clinical chemistry biomarkers, its correlation is like 0.94 to 0.96. But now the other
[4722.16s]  side of that equation is, is your biological age test associated with risk of death for all causes?
[4727.74s]  For Dunedin-Pace and Pheno age, this is true. But then even there, there's a scale. If you take all
[4733.02s]  of the biological age tests, how strongly or not do they correlate with all cause mortality risk and
[4738.66s]  or chronological age? So for something like Horvath, Horvath's methylation clocks, they strongly
[4744.34s]  correlate and are the strongest correlates of chronological age, but they are weakly correlated
[4749.56s]  with all cause mortality risk. Dunedin-Pace is consistently strongly correlated or relatively higher,
[4756.20s]  has a higher effect size for all cause mortality risk relative to Horvath. But Grim age, which I'm
[4762.44s]  sure most people don't know anything about. It sounds like an obscure name. Also an epigenetic test
[4766.66s]  is consistently in head-to-head matchups versus Dunedin-Pace. And even against Pheno age,
[4771.74s]  the clinical chemistry blood biomarker based test that I always talk about, Grim age better than them
[4777.66s]  all. So, but Pheno age is in the same ballpark. And actually Dunedin-Pace is probably top three.
[4782.38s]  If we, if we're going to make a top three biological age test for all cause mortality risk, those three
[4786.36s]  are in the boat. But Grim age is far and beyond consistently the best. Now, then that raises the
[4792.12s]  question. All right, we know what the biomarkers are in Pheno age and I'm measuring it. You're
[4795.82s]  measuring it. We know what the biomarkers are in Dunedin-Pace and you're measuring most of them.
[4799.52s]  What are the biomarkers in Grim age? So most of those are not on a clinical chemistry,
[4804.42s]  blood-based biomarker test, except for Cystatin C. So if we look at the seven, or actually it's
[4810.44s]  now nine biomarkers that are in Grim age. So Grim age has a version one and version two.
[4814.66s]  Version two now includes HSCRP and HbA1c. So we're covering that base. But for the six of the
[4822.00s]  seven other biomarkers, not including Cystatin C, they're not stuff you find on a standard blood
[4827.06s]  chemistry panel. And then also of those six of the seven biomarkers, they contribute more or less
[4832.84s]  strongly to the overall Grim age algorithm. In other words, just like the RDW is a major predictor
[4837.40s]  of Pheno age, which in your case is bringing your data down and making it look older than it is.
[4842.44s]  Some of Grim age's biomarkers are actually more strongly correlated with the overall Grim age
[4848.04s]  algorithm. And this goes just to the idea of, can we measure the actual biomarkers relative to the
[4851.86s]  predicted? So long story short there, Cystatin C is a strong contributor to the Grim age algorithm.
[4857.18s]  So essential in my mind, essential biomarker for tracking quote unquote longevity and overall health.
[4862.60s]  But there's another that I'm tracking regularly, which is beta two microglobulin. That's another
[4867.86s]  one of the nine Grim age version 2.0 biomarkers that has a correlation of greater than 0.8 as a
[4874.90s]  predictor of the overall Grim age algorithm. It includes other proteins that are less strongly,
[4879.70s]  less strongly related. There is one that I wish I could measure, which is GDF 15, which is like 0.9,
[4885.16s]  not commercially available. But when it comes to the epigenetic tests, I agree mostly with Matt
[4889.74s]  Haberlein's assessment, especially the ones he went over in his video for most epigenetic tests
[4893.86s]  being rubbish because the ones he covered in that test were pretty much rubbish. There is a
[4898.54s]  difference between all epigenetic tests in terms of telomere length. That's also a methylation based
[4903.18s]  estimation of telomere length for that. I wouldn't worry about the absolute number, but avoiding age
[4907.44s]  related change for whatever that metric is measuring, because it's still, it's still a prediction,
[4912.20s]  epigenetic prediction of an actual number. But for the phenol age, this is an important one because,
[4917.44s]  you know, and I hate to say it, but you know, for someone like Brian, who says he's got the best
[4922.14s]  biomarkers in the world, bro, you got to do better. Your phenol age is terrible and his RDW is fantastic.
[4928.36s]  So it's not an RDW problem. You know, and it's not a hard one. And I get you're in the same boat as him,
[4933.88s]  but your RDW is a bit high right now, but he, he, you don't proclaim to have the best biomarkers
[4938.18s]  aside from this video. He's been saying it for a while. So, you know, and there is a longevity
[4943.98s]  world cup and I don't want to say I'm currently leading it, but once I got in there.
[4947.76s]  You're currently leading it though.
[4949.14s]  Yeah, I am currently leading it though. And if you rank my data every year going back years,
[4954.18s]  I still be top 10. So here too, it's not just about the absolute number. It's,
[4959.06s]  this is a composite of nine actual biomarkers. So if you are not, if you're, if you're resisting age
[4964.48s]  related change for all, all of those nine, I'm more interested in the overall number over time.
[4970.10s]  Where is your quote unquote phenol age seven, 10 years later compared to where you started.
[4974.88s]  And if it's the same, well, you're, you're not, you're, you've potentially slowed aging rate for
[4979.78s]  at least those biomarkers, right? Does that translate into better health? Well, having a younger
[4984.24s]  phenol age is associated with a lower risk of death for all causes. So that's a positive.
[4988.72s]  That clock will increase by 0.9 years for every one year of chronological age. So if you fast forward
[4994.92s]  10 years, you should be nine years older. But if you've minimized that where there's no age
[4999.52s]  related increase, well, you've increased your biomarkers and potentially slowed aging rate. So
[5003.12s]  I'm more interested in long-term trends. And I have a video I just posted on Patreon yesterday that
[5008.76s]  won't make it to YouTube for about maybe about a month, um, where I show that data seven years of
[5013.90s]  phenol age, how am I doing in resisting age related change or not? How well am I doing?
[5017.76s]  So it's not just about the one test. Um, it's, it's about long-term trends, right? A true pace of
[5023.04s]  aging, not, not one test. Yeah, it's been a, it's been an interesting one. That was one of the ones
[5027.08s]  that I started with was the pheno age and then punching into there actually, cause you provided
[5030.90s]  online and, uh, immediately put in my data on that one. Yeah. It's a, I have these as deltas in here,
[5036.52s]  as I think they should be, because as you mentioned, it sort of just will go up with your age,
[5040.42s]  uh, cause it's part of the formula. Yeah. So, uh, a quick note, Chris, that, so, uh,
[5046.46s]  I, my adding the free Excel spreadsheet is now outdated because I guess if you just go on grok on X
[5053.58s]  and you type in calculate my pheno age, done easy. Don't have to do it. Yeah. Huh? Cool.
[5060.54s]  I mean, Hmm. I'm going to do that now. Next. But you've got to ask it for the corrected version
[5066.16s]  because there was an error in the, uh, you know, we've got, maybe we're not outdated. The Excel
[5071.56s]  version has the updated algorithm. There was confusion about the algorithm for better or worse,
[5076.14s]  but, uh, yeah, you've got to, you know, with all things LLMs, you've got to give it the right
[5079.82s]  question, you know, and ask, tell it to have the corrected version. And check it.
[5085.10s]  So this is, uh, the next one here I think is, uh, the key for me at least. Um, well, as you
[5090.64s]  mentioned, my, my numbers haven't been the best on everything. Um, as far as the amount of effort
[5095.66s]  that I put into it, and this is what I optimize for, um, uh, I'm quite happy with it. So as far as
[5101.72s]  the weekly workout hours, um, both Brian Johnson and Seam spend about six hours a week, uh, working out,
[5109.10s]  uh, Brian literally works out for an hour every day, except for Sunday. Um, and then Seam, when I
[5115.36s]  added the times together, came out to about six hours as well. And my, uh, whole intent behind this
[5120.04s]  is I go to the gym once a week for, um, about 40 minutes, um, do one hit workout for about 20 minutes
[5127.10s]  and one run for about 30 minutes. And as far as my straight up workout time, that's all that I do for
[5133.14s]  the entire week. Um, so the payoff I think has been fantastic for this amount of effort.
[5137.90s]  On the daily steps, this is where I, uh, bring up the, uh, bring the thunder because with my
[5142.98s]  walking desk and other things, and I think this is one of the most important things, the benefit that
[5147.08s]  you can get for it, I think this is one of the reasons why my CRP, my inflammation is so low,
[5151.40s]  is because of the amount of walking that I do. And I'm able to do it while I'm doing, uh,
[5156.98s]  computer stuff, working on my computer. Daily supplements as well. I mentioned the only
[5160.92s]  thing I'm taking really is potassium, um, which is quite a mild, uh, simple, uh, uh, vitamin,
[5167.88s]  um, that you could get with, uh, any bananas or anything. Whereas, uh, seems taking about 15 of
[5173.76s]  them. He has a number of them. I'm glycine, uh, taurine, uh, creatine, other things. And then Brian
[5181.78s]  Johnson has over a hundred of them and many of which he actually sells in pills that you can buy.
[5186.28s]  Um, I don't think that the evidence is conclusive on these drugs. And I think that the majority of
[5191.48s]  the benefit is available from the exercise and the diet stuff. Similarly, on the monthly cost,
[5196.08s]  Brian brags about spending, uh, $2 million a year on his health coming to $170,000 per month. Uh,
[5203.92s]  Seem, I think is, uh, paying more than that when I add up to the estimated costs for his supplements.
[5209.02s]  This is my estimate for his number, not his own. Uh, he doesn't publish these numbers. And for myself,
[5213.74s]  I have a $60 gym membership, uh, which enables me to do those squats and bench press that I do.
[5219.86s]  And the potassium is basically a wash. So there's virtually no expense put on my health.
[5225.26s]  Couldn't you technically add the steps? So that's about seven ish hours of walking.
[5230.08s]  Wouldn't you technically add that to your weekly workout hours?
[5232.96s]  So it's a workout and it's, I mean, it's not aerobic or anything for me. Um, that is,
[5237.78s]  that is one of the things that I kind of, uh, slide under the table, if you will. But, uh, also I
[5242.42s]  haven't added that in for the other people as well. Although I think actually, although I think
[5246.16s]  Sim does a certain amount of walking, maybe around 8,000 to 10,000 steps. Brian Johnson,
[5251.32s]  as far as I can tell from having read his stuff, doesn't walk any appreciable amount over an average
[5256.26s]  American, which is going to be around 4,000 to 6,000 steps. He does things like on the weekend where
[5261.94s]  he'll climb up a mountain, but that's clearly aerobic. He's doing it, um, with rooking and with
[5267.10s]  heavy weights and he's going up at speed, which isn't really the point of walking. You can't, uh,
[5271.86s]  speed run the walking to get the benefits out of it. Uh, the benefits of walking is the long time.
[5277.00s]  It's about an hour and a half to two hours of walking a day just to get 10,000 to 12,000 steps.
[5282.00s]  So you're right. Um, if I include those, uh, daily steps into the workout hours, then I am the worst
[5289.46s]  of this because that's, uh, two hours per day. It's going to be around 15 to 18 hours of, uh,
[5296.02s]  walking per week. But for me, that's time on my computer, uh, when I can be writing emails,
[5300.68s]  uh, responding to emails, uh, reading things as well, reading studies. So I don't consider it to
[5306.74s]  be extra time. Yeah. So I, and I think walking is great exercise. Don't get me wrong, but, uh,
[5312.20s]  you know, it's that it's, there are other ways to get that cardiovascular stimulus that are not,
[5316.46s]  that are lost because they're not technically taking steps. For example, it's not, it's not
[5320.78s]  cardiovascular though. Um, there's, uh, I, I make a distinction between it. I mean, it's low physical
[5326.36s]  activity, uh, low intensity physical activity, but you shouldn't be out of breath at all. I mean,
[5330.88s]  it depends for some people if walking is cardiovascular activity, I'm usually, uh, thinking
[5335.62s]  of people for whom it is no longer, there's no, uh, effort to do so. Ah, but even if your resting
[5341.86s]  heart rate is 50 or 60, and if you're going for a walk, you're resting heart, your, your,
[5345.96s]  your heart rate during that walk is going to increase. Maybe it's up to, if you're highly
[5349.34s]  fit, maybe it goes to 75, 85, 90, that's a cardiovascular stimulus. It's not a, you're
[5354.68s]  not doing a hard, hard quote unquote workout, but there is going to be a benefit for a low,
[5359.30s]  you know, a high volume, low intensity walking, you know, but anyway, my point around that is
[5363.68s]  the one reason I don't focus on steps is, you know, there are other low to moderate intensity
[5369.94s]  exercises that are beneficial for, for cardiovascular health, um, that don't have to be walking.
[5375.46s]  Like, you know, my workouts are right now, 75 minutes circuit rating based I'm getting, you
[5380.72s]  know, my average heart rate, which is an underestimate by whoop is around 120 beats per minute. It may
[5385.86s]  be a bit higher 130 because whoop is known to underestimate heart rate during workouts. So I'm
[5390.20s]  getting a 75 minute cardiovascular stimulus. I mean, which is pretty much if you translate 75
[5395.10s]  minutes, whole body elevated heart rate for that time, that's, you know, an eight mile run. If we,
[5400.66s]  if we, or so, if we tracked it over at worst, that's a slow pace, right? So if I track steps,
[5406.86s]  I would never get that because I'm not walking anywhere. I'm just moving. I'm distributing it
[5411.26s]  everywhere. Another thing also is like, if we put my steps on this list, I'd probably be
[5416.20s]  just as low as Brian, you know, I, I walking is a part of my approach. Don't get me wrong. But for
[5421.48s]  example, for the past two days, I've been doing some, uh, chainsawing, you know, cutting down trees.
[5426.44s]  Nice. I mean, yeah, it's okay. For me, it's exercise. It's a nice workout, but I'm not going
[5431.62s]  anywhere and I am getting a cardiovascular stimulus. When I look at the data, it's a stress
[5435.58s]  trace that looks like I'm doing, and I have to be careful to modulate that. Otherwise it'll start to
[5440.06s]  negatively impact my HRV arresting heart rate recovery. But there are other things we can do
[5444.60s]  activity wise. It doesn't just have to be steps. You know, it can be in a variety of ways to get that
[5449.04s]  cardiovascular stimulus. All right. I have one more note about this is the monthly cost. Brian's is
[5453.84s]  dramatically, uh, under, because if you just factor in, I think he took 26 Dunedin pace tests in a year
[5461.56s]  or some outrageous number. Um, you know, because he's trying to get his lowest number ever, right?
[5466.88s]  So he's taking, he's, you know, taking the tests as many times and it's a 200 plus dollar test. So
[5472.14s]  that's at least twice per month. That's $400 a month just on Dunedin test. Now I get, you've got it for
[5478.40s]  supplements, but we can add at least $400 to that cost. Plus what about the cost of having your own
[5483.28s]  HBOT and doing all the stem cell therapies and all the other therapies? I mean, the cost is off
[5487.44s]  the charts. So, um, also the point I want to make is with all those supplements, that phenol age is still
[5493.44s]  not great. Right. So, you know, and I, I like Brian, I appreciate him. You know, I'm not the type
[5500.42s]  to ruin someone's spotlight to shade them for their spotlight. I'm not that guy, but constructive
[5506.60s]  criticism, you know, for, for someone that claims to have a team of, we do this for this reason and this,
[5511.70s]  for this reason. Well, what are those hundreds of supplements doing? You know, are you actually
[5515.42s]  moving the needle on, uh, more things than not? I'd like to see some correlations, you know, between,
[5520.10s]  you know, supplements and biomarkers and, you know, planned approach. He did, he's been doing that for
[5525.82s]  psilocybin. I mean, he heavily has documented that I'm awaiting the blood test, you know, data,
[5531.12s]  and I'm sure that there are going to be some, uh, over exaggerations based on pre because you would
[5537.30s]  need to do that experiment five times. Show me some five, at least five tests baseline and five tests
[5541.84s]  with, without psilocybin. But, uh, yeah, I mean for, for a hundred supplements, it's a lot to be
[5546.88s]  taking to have a nine year younger phenol age. And that just shows you can't biohack your way to
[5551.88s]  having quote unquote optimal biomarkers for at least those nine. So not, not with the, uh,
[5557.56s]  supplements. Those are going to have a very indirect if like, yeah, it does. I don't think that,
[5561.50s]  but we chose the path doesn't really get that way. It could, but you know, it's maybe that they're
[5566.58s]  just not targeting the right supplements or some supplements are just, you know, doing more harm
[5571.24s]  than good in some cases. So, and which would those be? Okay. Hmm. Well, that brings us to the end of
[5577.88s]  this one. Right. So we're going to, uh, jump straight now into the, uh, unaging challenge.
[5583.74s]  Um, so I've talked about this a few times, uh, on your podcast. Uh, it's been an exciting journey. So,
[5589.40s]  uh, we're just wrapping up now the, we're in the last month of the 2025 unaging challenge.
[5595.10s]  We started with about 130 people, uh, who registered for the challenge. It's a free challenge
[5600.02s]  and I've been watching it go steadily through and I must say the numbers have dropped significantly.
[5605.02s]  So I would say that it's living up to the challenge name. It's not easy to do the things,
[5610.72s]  although the time, as I've mentioned, is not that significant, um, is not that much of your week.
[5615.60s]  It's about an hour and a half of, uh, exercise time per week. And that's not including the walking.
[5621.06s]  Don't spoil that. But the actual gym time is only about an hour and a half.
[5624.64s]  And in return for that, you get about an approximated estimated extra 20 years of life
[5630.54s]  taking you to nearly the centenarian level on an average, according to the actuarial tables
[5636.38s]  and the observational tables. There's no guarantee on that. You won't get any money back. It's not going
[5640.52s]  to cure cancer. Uh, but it will give you a significant health increase. At the end of it now,
[5644.66s]  we already still have around, around 10 or 20 people who are still continuing the challenge.
[5649.52s]  And we've made some improvements to it, uh, in the clarity, the emails, uh, the support structure
[5654.98s]  that we set up for it. So we're doing the 2026 challenge. So to talk about some of the things
[5659.58s]  that they did in the challenge last year, oops, that's the wrong way. So, uh, people had about
[5664.06s]  a 65% increase overall in strength. Uh, this is a very blended figure. So for some of these people,
[5669.82s]  they were beginners and had a doubling or more. It's hard to say because they're just starting
[5674.40s]  to lift weights, but even the experienced people myself, when I did it with the early adopters,
[5678.54s]  I grew in about 10%, uh, strength from doing more intensive stuff, as well as taking the creatine,
[5684.00s]  which I don't take regularly, but for special occasions and for really building bulk, it's a
[5688.28s]  great way to do it in a shorter period of time. But what I, the way I like to think of it though,
[5692.32s]  is you put all the people together who did the strength challenge part of the unaging challenge
[5696.78s]  and all of the amount of weight that they lifted in kilograms, it was enough actually to
[5701.28s]  lift a fully loaded semi between all of us. So this is our joint effort in, uh, moving heavy
[5708.72s]  objects, picking them off, off the floor or pushing them away from the bench. And, uh,
[5713.24s]  through the challenge, we go through and let people customize and work out the best way to do
[5717.36s]  an exercise for you and make sure that people are doing it at the level that's appropriate for them.
[5722.00s]  It's for people who are beginners who are also trainers can learn ways to treat their own, uh,
[5726.72s]  routine and other things and weightlifting routine to get the most effective one for the least amount
[5731.44s]  of time. So then after that, we go through a walking challenge and see how far people can walk and get
[5736.96s]  closer to that 12,000 steps, which I think is ideal per day. And between the entire team, uh, we walked,
[5743.20s]  uh, 11 million steps over a period of three months, which is enough to have walked from Anchorage,
[5748.16s]  Alaska down to Miami, Florida and, uh, enjoy the beautiful beaches down there. So we'll continue to do
[5754.32s]  these things. Part of the whole idea of the unaging challenge is not only that you learn to do some
[5758.24s]  things yourself and you track it. So it's a challenge. This makes sure that you're doing it,
[5761.92s]  but we put people into groups together, uh, teams that are then visible on a semi-private level.
[5767.92s]  So you can see what the other people are doing. Uh, not only are you accountable to yourself for
[5772.48s]  doing the challenge and doing the steps or the weightlifting, but also other people will be able to
[5776.80s]  see and you can compare trade notes. We have a discord that we set up to do for it and weekly
[5781.52s]  emails that go with these are the goals for the week. Best of luck. Here's how things are going.
[5785.92s]  And sort of in that line, here's the, uh, the group of people who were the early adopters, uh,
[5790.80s]  for the unaging challenge. These are friends of mine, uh, from around Tokyo who did it. We had around
[5796.00s]  25 people who did it in the very first batch. And I can tell you, it's one of the most rewarding
[5800.72s]  things to have worked with the people I know and to have worked through the program and have
[5805.28s]  actually seen the transformation. Uh, my birthday is around September. And so then when I had a
[5811.20s]  birthday party and had a bunch of people come over, it was very apparent that these people were
[5815.04s]  more fit and in better shape than they had been than we started at the beginning of the year.
[5819.60s]  So, uh, enrollment is free. Uh, it's open now on my website at unaging.com. If you'd like to
[5826.24s]  participate in the 2026 unaging challenge, welcome. Uh, you can come by yourself or you can come with
[5832.56s]  other people. There's a place in the forum. If you'd like to be placed with, uh, another group of
[5837.12s]  people, uh, I had some people from my high school, several who have continued all the way through to
[5841.36s]  the end, uh, who've done it with me or with my other friends or with a group of other people,
[5845.28s]  all is welcome and, uh, make 2026 the year that you, uh, achieve your health goals.
[5851.68s]  Anything you want to add or say about that, Michael?
[5853.84s]  Michael No, I think it's great. I think it's great that, uh, 25 people is a lot, you know, and,
[5859.12s]  and, uh, anything, any, anything intended on improving people's health through lifestyle.
[5866.96s]  It's great. Like we don't have to wait for published trials. I mean, you're,
[5869.92s]  you recruited a big enough group to potentially positively impact, you know, a lot of people. So
[5875.36s]  I think it's great. Um, I think in an earlier in the, one of the earlier
[5879.20s]  unaging challenges, you showed some, uh, biomarker data, maybe HRV or something like that. So are
[5884.88s]  there plans to include at least HRV resting heart rate and, or maybe even like, you know,
[5889.60s]  blood tests, because that would be really interesting to see, you know, blood pressure
[5894.00s]  function, even blood pressure. If you have everyone come in for a blood pressure reading, you know,
[5897.76s]  a couple of days in a row before starting, and then, you know, a month in two months in and really,
[5902.72s]  you know, looking at something that would change over time, uh, to show that it's not just fitness,
[5907.28s]  it's also the stuff on the inside that's potentially improving. I think, I don't know. Are there any
[5911.52s]  plans to do some of that? So, um, the only, uh, device that, uh, we regularly ask for is the HRV
[5918.48s]  and the resting heart rate and also the VO2 max as measured by a wearable. And we leave that to
[5922.96s]  people to determine for themselves what they want to use for the wearable. Uh, we had one person who
[5927.36s]  said, I'm not sure for the walking thing. I don't have a pedometer. I'm not sure I can do this. And
[5930.80s]  then she's like, wait, my phone counts my step. It's fine. I got this. So, uh, we want to be as,
[5938.48s]  um, as free for people to pick their own thing. Uh, many people have done exactly what you said,
[5943.60s]  where they've tested it, but we haven't recorded all of that data. Uh, one is that I don't want that
[5948.32s]  much personal data. Um, although we do go through with the amount of weight lifting that's been done
[5954.24s]  and the resting heart rate and the other things that we can see the benefit over time. And, uh,
[5958.32s]  some of the things have been surprising. Like some people have said that they've had the best sleep,
[5962.80s]  uh, from the resting, from the unaging challenge that they've had in years. Specifically, the walking
[5968.80s]  seems to have a huge help with that. One of the other people in it said that, um, they're able to
[5972.80s]  sleep in the same room with their wife again because their snoring has greatly been reduced by
[5977.04s]  doing the unaging challenge. Um, it's not a weight loss program. There are other things, uh, for that.
[5983.36s]  It's more on overall health and longevity. Although several of the people on it have found that they've
[5988.16s]  been losing weight if they've just kind of taken a different focus for it. Um, the last, uh, quarter
[5993.20s]  of the challenge is called the unaging plate challenge, where then we take a look at diet
[5997.04s]  and just see what it would be to take, uh, a simple framework that give you the steps that you
[6002.00s]  need to make sure that you're getting a healthy diet to take out, uh, put in the big winners and
[6007.28s]  take out the big losers so that you can have a healthier life. And we track all of it meticulously
[6012.24s]  on if you eat this food, it costs you this many minutes of life or gains you this many minutes of life.
[6017.44s]  So it's, uh, it's very much numbers based. Um, but it's, uh, more so about the team and coming
[6022.88s]  through together and doing the best thing to improve for yourself. We don't have a leaderboard
[6027.76s]  on it because the leaderboard is what we achieve together and how much life we save on it. So
[6032.96s]  I'm very happy with it. Uh, very proud of it. And I hope that more people participate in it this year.
[6037.84s]  Nice. And then, so is the intention to have it relatively small because what happens,
[6043.28s]  what happens, uh, at some point because I'm going to be doing this forever or as long as my forever
[6049.36s]  is. And you too, I'm sure in terms of health and, you know, longevity optimization. So I can only
[6054.64s]  imagine that. So in 20 in this year, were there more people for this version of the unaging challenge?
[6059.60s]  Weren't there more people than last time? We've, uh, we've, uh, operationalized it and, um,
[6065.52s]  the teams are always small. So the teams are around 10 to 20 or people. So per team for a couple of
[6070.64s]  reasons, just, um, one thing is to keep sort of the information a little bit tighter. And so that
[6075.12s]  it's a group of people that you could say, okay, you sort of recognize, um, but we can scale up to a
[6079.68s]  larger number of teams. Uh, we, with my initial early adopters group, we had just one team of about
[6085.44s]  20 people or so. Um, but then when we did the challenge, we started out with 14 different
[6089.76s]  teams of people. Actually. Yeah. I think we had about 14 different teams. So we'll continue to
[6093.92s]  increase the number of teams. Uh, we're also looking at the input mechanism to see if we can
[6097.84s]  make it a little simpler, uh, and make it a little bit more intuitive eventually. Um, probably we'll
[6103.44s]  make it into an app if it continues to be popular and we continue to increase the numbers. Uh, and then
[6108.00s]  that will give us a lot more ability to sort of pull some of that data stuff to make it perhaps more
[6111.84s]  rigorous on the reporting side. Nice. So it could be a global movement, right? At some point,
[6117.44s]  if it gets big enough, I know I'm, you know, this is a delusional, or grander, right? Right. But
[6125.20s]  you never know with these things. So, and the intention is good. The intention is to do,
[6128.88s]  you know, to improve people's health. So, so do people have to be in Japan? Is this a Japan
[6133.20s]  local only? Not at all. Uh, we have someone doing it right now at Antarctica. So no, uh,
[6139.12s]  you can be wherever you are. Uh, it works with the materials that you have at hand. Um, for the
[6143.36s]  weightlifting, uh, portion of it, you do need to find a place where you can lift heavy objects.
[6147.36s]  Um, but many people have done that in their own houses, uh, or with their own home gyms or with
[6153.04s]  straps and other things. So no, there's no, uh, geographic requirement for it. Open to all.
[6157.28s]  I guess the, uh, Antarctica, we can find out about the, uh, alien bases, right?
[6162.24s]  I'm joking. He's taking it up now, sending messages.
[6165.52s]  I'm like, I'm like 99% joking. There's like these internet memes of, uh, you know,
[6170.96s]  there are aliens in Antarctica and us studying this and this and that. So anyway,
[6177.44s]  thanks, Chris. This is great. Uh, I appreciate having you on. You're always great to,
[6181.28s]  we could go for hours. So yeah, this is, this has been great. And, uh,
[6184.16s]  thanks for being on today. Yeah. Great. Thank you so much for the opportunity and all the feedback on,
[6188.64s]  uh, the biomarkers and things, uh, lots of stuff to think about. Always a pleasure, Michael.
[6195.52s]  Thank you.
