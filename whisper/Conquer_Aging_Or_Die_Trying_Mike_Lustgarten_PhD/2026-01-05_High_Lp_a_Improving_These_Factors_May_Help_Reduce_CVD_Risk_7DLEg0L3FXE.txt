[0.00s]  Even if someone's got relatively high lipoprotein A, 75, 80 nanomolar or more, having HSCRP less
[6.30s]  than two milligrams per liter, not 0.2, that essentially the CHD mortality risk goes away.
[12.42s]  But if you've got high HSCRP, the risk increases based on CHD risk based on lipoprotein A.
[19.16s]  And then also the waist to hip ratio. So when waist to hip ratio is less than 0.93,
[24.60s]  it's not associated with an increased risk of lipoprotein A associated CBD outcomes. But for
[29.26s]  people who had a waist to hip ratio greater than one, and I've got a video commenting on,
[32.88s]  actually I released it today. It's on YouTube today. But so for people who have a waist to hip
[39.70s]  ratio greater than one, lipoprotein A higher than 50 milligrams per deciliter, which would be 125
[45.60s]  nanomolar way off the charts compared to the three of you guys, that's associated with an increased CBD
[50.86s]  mortality outcome risk. Whereas people with lipoprotein A less than 50 milligrams per
[55.84s]  deciliter and 125 nanomolar with a waist to hip ratio less than 0.93, no association with CBD
[61.56s]  mortality related outcomes. So there may be for people who have hot, relatively high lipoprotein A
[67.34s]  ways to modulate that risk by keeping inflammation low and waist to hip ratio low.
[72.38s]  So I'm going to go ahead to the doctor. So I think with Dr.
