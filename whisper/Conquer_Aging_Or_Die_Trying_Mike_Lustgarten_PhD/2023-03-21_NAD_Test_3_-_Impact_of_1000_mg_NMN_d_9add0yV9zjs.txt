[0.32s]  What's my intracellular level of NAD? To sort that out, on January 23rd of 2023, I sent blood for
[7.26s]  analysis to Ginfinity Precision Medicine, and we saw that my NAD level was 25.6 micromolar,
[13.60s]  which then raises the question, is that value youthful or aged? So when using Ginfinity's data
[19.36s]  for how NAD levels change during aging, we saw that it was in the aged category. So with that
[25.32s]  in mind, I supplemented with 300 milligrams per day of NMN for the next 21 days as soon as get
[29.90s]  it, as soon as I got the data after test number one, retesting on February 21st of 2023. And if
[36.02s]  you're interested in why I used NMN instead of Niacin, I covered that in an earlier video, which
[40.72s]  will be in the right corner. So then using 300 milligrams per day of NMN, we saw that my intracellular
[46.24s]  level of NAD was essentially the same, 25.3 micromolar. So no effect. So I decided to further
[53.20s]  increase NMN going with one gram per day or 1000 milligrams of NMN per day for one week.
[59.90s]  And I retested on March 5th of 2023. So what was the impact on NAD? And here we can see that I
[66.82s]  finally got an increase for my intracellular level of NAD as it went up to 39.3 micromolar.
[72.52s]  And now I would be close in the close to youthful range as values greater than 40 micromolar would
[78.20s]  be expected to be found in people younger than 30 years old. But now for the caveats. First,
[83.38s]  a higher NAD level, because I sent these data on the same day that I did a full blood panel,
[88.74s]  there was no change for blood biomarker-based biological age, including Levine's test and
[94.66s]  aging.ai. In contrary to an earlier hypothesis that I pitched in a separate video where I thought
[101.28s]  that having higher NAD could potentially impact DHEA sulfate, there was no impact on DHEA sulfate
[106.82s]  as it was 129 micrograms per deciliter, which is within the range of where it usually is.
[112.50s]  But if there is a reason for hope, it's possible that higher NAD impacted my epigenetic age as I
[118.94s]  sent blood for epigenetic analysis to True Diagnostic on the same day that I did this test. So it's
[124.18s]  possible that having higher NAD impacted my epigenetic age. So I don't yet have that data. I expect to have
[129.52s]  it either late this month or early in April. So stay tuned for that update video coming soon.
[135.22s]  All right, that's all for now. If you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging,
