[0.40s]  Trimethylamine N-oxide, which is otherwise known as TMAO, is bad for health.
[6.12s]  And that's what we'll see here.
[7.80s]  So TMAO negatively impacts the kidney, brain, high blood pressure, heart failure, peripheral
[13.68s]  vascular disease, and also atherosclerosis.
[17.24s]  So in today's video, we'll take a deep dive into which factors impact plasma levels of
[21.56s]  TMAO.
[22.56s]  Additionally, later in the video, what's my data, as I have 21 tests tracking this important
[28.12s]  biomarker.
[29.28s]  But for now, let's take a look at which foods contain TMAO.
[33.16s]  TMAO is found in fish.
[34.98s]  And that's what we'll see here.
[36.50s]  On the y-axis, we've got the concentration of TMAO and its precursor metabolite, TMA or
[41.84s]  trimethylamine.
[42.84s]  And I'll have more on that mechanism coming up in just a bit.
[46.48s]  And on the x-axis, we've got many different fish types.
[49.94s]  So in terms of where the highest content of TMAO and TMA is found, it's in cod, lobster
[56.04s]  and orange ruffey.
[57.40s]  But what about fish types that are commonly consumed by those of us in the longevity community?
[61.58s]  For example, salmon.
[62.92s]  Well, we can see that farm-raised salmon is very low for its content of TMAO and TMA.
[68.84s]  But I wouldn't recommend that anybody consume farm-raised salmon.
[72.10s]  I'd prefer to get the wild-caught version.
[74.34s]  Where there, we can see that it has more TMA plus TMAO relative to farm-raised salmon.
[80.26s]  When considering that TMAO is found in fish, that would suggest that fish may be associated
[85.60s]  with some of those adverse health-related outcomes for TMAO that I just showed in the previous slide.
[90.78s]  So for now, let's take a look at one of those associations and ask the question, is fish intake
[96.50s]  associated with Alzheimer's disease incident risk?
[99.26s]  And that's what we'll see here.
[100.88s]  This is a meta-analysis of 11 studies.
[103.50s]  And on the y-axis, we've got relative risk for a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease plotted
[108.84s]  against fish intake in grams per day.
[110.80s]  In terms of what's significant, we put up a red line at a hazard ratio of one.
[115.10s]  So with the dashed black lines, if they are completely below one or completely above one,
[120.02s]  we have a significant association.
[122.26s]  And what we can see is that for both low and high intakes of fish, there was no significant
[127.22s]  association for fish intake with Alzheimer's disease incident risk.
[131.00s]  If anything, at intermediate intakes of around 70 grams per day, we can see that the upper
[135.82s]  bound of that 95% confidence interval, the dashed black line, almost overlaps with that
[141.06s]  hazard ratio of one.
[141.90s]  In other words, it's a close to significant association for a lower Alzheimer's disease
[146.66s]  incident risk in association with about 70 grams of fish intake per day.
[150.96s]  But it overlaps with that red line, so it's not a significant association.
[154.92s]  So from these data, we can see that fish intake is not associated with Alzheimer's disease
[159.90s]  incident risk.
[160.76s]  So this would argue against TMAO coming from fish being related to maybe some of those
[165.80s]  adverse health related outcomes that I showed on the previous slide.
[169.50s]  On the other hand, gut bacteria produce trimethylamine, which is what we'll see here.
[174.58s]  So starting off in the intestine, dietary precursors including betaine, choline, and ergothionine,
[179.84s]  but also carnitine and its derived metabolite, gamma-butyrobetaine, are converted by gut bacterial
[186.16s]  enzymes into TMA or trimethylamine.
[189.58s]  TMA then travels through the blood to the liver, where it is converted, actually oxidized by the
[195.08s]  liver into trimethylamine N-oxide or TMAO.
[199.28s]  So with that in mind, which foods contain these TMAO precursors?
[204.44s]  Well, for the first three, carnitine, choline, and betaine, they're found in beef, eggs, and
[209.50s]  shrimp.
[209.78s]  And I should say some of you probably not probably yelling at me, this guy's anti-meat.
[213.78s]  No, that's not at all what I'm about to go through.
[216.72s]  I'm going to say actually the opposite.
[218.22s]  These foods have been unfairly villainized for their potential role in TMAO formation,
[223.74s]  and I'll show why that's the case in a minute.
[226.42s]  And that's because, in part, because betaine is also found in non-meat-containing foods,
[231.44s]  including beets.
[232.76s]  And ergothionine is found in high abundance in mushrooms.
[235.60s]  So if the TMAO story being found in blood was as simple as eat less meat, well, what about
[241.68s]  vegans who are eating no meat but are eating lots of mushrooms and lots of beets?
[246.56s]  Potentially, that could be converted into TMA and correspondingly TMAO2.
[251.84s]  So the gut bacteria TMAO story isn't as simple as reducing intake of these specific foods,
[257.74s]  and we'll see why that's true in a second.
[260.12s]  For that, we'll take a look at which factors impact gut bacterial trimethylamine production.
[265.30s]  And a main factor that controls whether or not TMAO is produced is the pH in the gut lumen.
[271.94s]  So the gut lumen is the inside of the tube that is the intestine.
[275.52s]  And under normal conditions, it should be acidic, not alkaline.
[279.42s]  However, when the pH inside of the gut lumen becomes more alkaline,
[283.46s]  that leads to the growth of pathogenic bacteria,
[286.22s]  which produce TMA, which is then correspondingly oxidized to TMAO in the liver.
[291.54s]  Those pathogenic bacteria don't just produce TMA and correspondingly TMAO.
[296.04s]  They also produce other metabolites that are bad for health,
[298.72s]  including endoxyl sulfate, IS, and pericresol sulfate, PCS.
[302.98s]  And I've covered those other metabolites, those other gut bacteria-derived metabolites,
[306.90s]  in videos on the channel, and I'll link to a couple of them in the right corner.
[310.44s]  So once they're produced inside of the gut lumen, they can then diffuse, as shown here,
[315.54s]  in between the spaces for epithelial cells, which are normally connected by tight junctions,
[320.30s]  which would be disrupted in this case, and then they can be found in the blood.
[325.20s]  Now, the importance of that lumen pH rise being a significant contributor to TMAO production
[331.08s]  is that fecal pH increases during aging, which is what we'll see here.
[335.50s]  So on the y-axis, we've got fecal pH, and then we've got three groups.
[339.74s]  CE is centenarian, older, and then young subjects.
[343.80s]  And what we can see is that when compared with the young subjects,
[346.58s]  centenarians had significantly higher fecal pH relative to young.
[351.18s]  And if we're looking at the actual numbers, the average fecal pH in the centenarians was 8,
[355.82s]  and it was 7 in the young subjects.
[358.00s]  Now, you could say 8 versus 7, so what?
[359.96s]  That's not a big pH difference, but pH is a log scale, which means that the pH in the centenarians
[365.94s]  was 10 times less acidic relative to the younger subjects.
[370.28s]  So with that in mind, which factors impact lumen pH?
[374.24s]  Well, a major factor is fecal levels of short-chain fatty acids, or SCFAs.
[380.58s]  These SCFAs include acetate, propionate, and butyrate, which can be produced by high-fiber diet,
[386.38s]  but also exercise training.
[387.94s]  So if someone is eating a relatively low-fiber diet and lots of meat,
[392.38s]  we could expect to see high levels of TMAO.
[395.54s]  Alternatively, if someone is not doing any exercise training,
[398.92s]  we could expect to see relatively low levels of fecal short-chain fatty acids
[402.68s]  and correspondingly high levels of TMAO.
[405.42s]  Now, I should mention there's more to that story.
[407.10s]  It also involves kidney function and removing TMAO,
[409.76s]  but a major part of this story is acidification of the gut lumen
[413.78s]  and limiting the growth of bacteria that can produce TMA in the first place.
[417.94s]  All right, so now that we've defined how TMAO is produced,
[421.84s]  what's optimal?
[422.90s]  Can we put a specific number on plasma levels of TMAO?
[426.20s]  So that's what we'll see here.
[427.66s]  This is a meta-analysis of 10 studies that looked at relative risk,
[431.22s]  or risk of death for all causes, plotted against plasma levels of TMAO.
[435.24s]  In terms of what was significant, we put up that red line at a hazard ratio of 1 again,
[439.86s]  and now when the shaded blue region is completely above 1 or completely below 1,
[444.66s]  we have a significant association.
[446.66s]  And we can see that that's first true at lower levels when TMAO was less than 2 micromolar,
[451.80s]  as the shaded blue region is completely below that hazard ratio of 1.
[455.58s]  On the other hand, when TMAO levels reached greater than 4 micromolar,
[459.98s]  that was significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.
[463.62s]  But this is just half of the equation for defining what may be optimal for plasma levels of TMAO.
[469.26s]  The other side of the equation is how does TMAO change during aging,
[473.10s]  which is what we'll see here.
[474.82s]  Plasma levels of TMAO in young, middle-aged, and older, MA-O groups.
[481.02s]  For the young subjects, they were 20 to 27 years old,
[483.90s]  and for the middle-aged to older, they were 50 to 79 years old.
[486.96s]  So first, we can see that 2 micromolar value pops up again as the average value found in youth,
[492.52s]  which then approximately tripled in the middle-aged and older group.
[496.66s]  So in terms of defining what's optimal for TMAO when putting these two pieces of data together,
[501.90s]  first, less than 2 micromolar as the target, as that was consistent across both of these studies,
[507.44s]  but then also avoiding the age-related increase.
[509.96s]  Now, note that TMAO can be tracked.
[512.30s]  This isn't just a health and longevity news channel.
[515.18s]  This is also a health optimization channel.
[517.72s]  So TMAO can be tracked.
[519.26s]  And with that in mind, I've been using at-home metabolomics with the kit shown here,
[522.68s]  IOLO's at-home metabolomics kit, which, including TMAO, has 623 metabolites.
[529.06s]  So if you want to use this kit yourself, discount link in the video's description.
[532.94s]  All right, so what's my data?
[534.84s]  That's what we'll see here.
[535.80s]  This is plasma levels of TMAO over the past three years, from 2023 to 2025.
[541.42s]  And again, I have 21 tests over this three-year period.
[544.70s]  So when I first started tracking in 2023, over five tests, average TMAO was 7.3 micromolar.
[550.94s]  Over nine tests in 2024, a bit better to six micromolar, average six micromolar.
[556.72s]  And then after the first seven tests, I'm waiting on test results for test number eight.
[560.70s]  After the first seven tests in 2025, average TMAO is 4.6 micromolar.
[566.32s]  All right, so how can we put this into the context of what's optimal?
[569.80s]  Well, half of that equation was avoiding the age-related increase.
[573.54s]  So for at least this three-year period, this is good news.
[576.88s]  But the other side of the what's optimal is less than two micromolar.
[580.90s]  And unfortunately, with average values for all three of these years, that's a fail.
[586.08s]  I haven't been able to do that yet.
[587.82s]  But there's good news, potentially good news in this story, where I may have
[591.48s]  discovered what the recipe is for helping to keep it low in my case.
[595.66s]  As we can see that I've been able to achieve relatively low levels of TMAO below that
[600.80s]  two micromolar target for at least two of these 21 tests.
[604.76s]  And note that for two additional recent tests, it was a bit closer to four micromolar on the
[610.34s]  right track towards getting it to less than two micromolar.
[614.10s]  But is this random variability, just random test-to-test variability, or am I doing something?
[619.70s]  So with that in mind, how can I reduce, how can I further reduce and keep it
[622.86s]  below that two micromolar target?
[625.00s]  How can I reduce plasma levels of TMAO?
[627.28s]  So for now, we're going to take a look at correlations between diet with plasma levels of TMAO.
[632.94s]  And for those who may be unfamiliar, I've weighed almost all of my food with a food scale
[637.58s]  since 2015.
[638.70s]  So for the past 10 years, probably 99% or more, all of it with a food scale.
[643.72s]  I then take that data, enter it into a diet tracking app, Chronometer.
[647.54s]  And if you want to use Chronometer yourself, there's a discount link in the video description.
[651.52s]  I then pull the Chronometer data into a spreadsheet.
[654.98s]  So now each test has an average dietary intake that is lined up together.
[659.86s]  So with enough tests, because I have tracked dietary intake, I can look at correlations.
[664.82s]  And that's what we're going to see here with the top portion of the correlations for diet
[668.78s]  versus TMAO as shown there.
[671.00s]  And note that if you want to see the full correlation list, I have a specific tier on Patreon,
[676.42s]  a correlations tier that doesn't just include correlations for diet with TMAO, but all of
[681.64s]  those 623 metabolomic metabolites.
[684.44s]  But then also 25 to 30 standard clinical chemistry biomarkers that I test eight times per year.
[690.80s]  So if you're interested in that, check it out.
[692.96s]  All right.
[693.20s]  So on this list, we've got the lowercase r, which is the correlation coefficient.
[697.10s]  And then to the right, we've got the p-value where I've used less than 0.05, nominally
[701.84s]  significant as the significance threshold.
[704.58s]  In terms of what's significant and atop the list, we see garlic and there's a negative
[708.74s]  correlation there.
[709.50s]  So what that means is, or what that suggests is that relatively higher intakes of garlic,
[713.96s]  in my case, the recipe may be different for others.
[716.48s]  I'd encourage tracking your own data to try to discover your own personalized recipe.
[721.06s]  Relatively higher intakes of garlic are significantly correlated with lower levels of TMAO.
[726.32s]  Now note that I said correlation.
[728.28s]  I am not at all implying causation.
[730.22s]  The only way to test causation is to actually do the experiment.
[733.46s]  And I'll have more on that in a minute.
[735.64s]  But garlic isn't the only inverse correlation with TMAO on this list.
[739.82s]  We can see that there are many others, including zinc, avocado, nutmeg, celery, non-fat yogurt,
[745.88s]  mufo or monounsaturated fatty acids, olives, and black pepper.
[750.20s]  Now, I also don't know which, if any of these, are actually causative.
[754.22s]  So what I generally try to do is to follow as many on the list as possible with the goal
[758.34s]  of moving a biomarker in the quote unquote right direction and away from age-related trends.
[763.48s]  But note that there are also positive correlations on this table, including banana, dates, and salt.
[771.06s]  So what that suggests is when intakes of these foods are relatively higher,
[774.84s]  that's significantly correlated with higher levels of TMAO.
[777.68s]  And that will be data moving in the wrong direction.
[780.78s]  All right.
[780.96s]  So in terms of interventions that I made for test number 22,
[784.04s]  I decided to follow or specifically decided to follow the garlic correlation.
[788.08s]  But what the table shows isn't how much garlic that I should actually add to try to make a dent
[793.68s]  on plasma levels of TMAO.
[795.66s]  So let's take a look at the plot for garlic versus TMAO as shown here.
[800.38s]  With TMAO on the waxes, now the average daily garlic intake that corresponds to each one of these
[806.06s]  blood tests on the X.
[807.88s]  So first we can see that significant inverse correlation.
[810.68s]  So higher levels of garlic significantly correlated with lower levels of TMAO.
[814.14s]  And then if we're going to extrapolate based on that trend line to reach that two micromolar
[819.24s]  target or lower, we can see that I'd have to achieve or predicted I'd have to achieve garlic
[825.68s]  intakes of around my highest intake of 3.5 grams per day.
[829.84s]  So with that in mind, I aimed higher for test number 22.
[833.24s]  Test number 21 was taken at the end of October.
[835.82s]  Test number 22 was taken in December, late December.
[839.20s]  And there were 60 days in between those tests.
[841.50s]  And my average garlic intake over that 60 day period was 2.9 grams per day.
[846.86s]  Now granted, not as high as 3.5 grams per day.
[849.58s]  But if we take a look at the plot, we can see that I don't have any data within that range.
[854.42s]  2.7 to about 3.5 grams of garlic per day.
[858.20s]  So at worst, it'll help fill in the plot to see if this is a real correlation or not.
[863.74s]  Now if 2.9 grams of garlic per day doesn't make a dent on TMAO,
[868.36s]  its correlation will weaken, other correlations will strengthen,
[871.04s]  and then I'll continue to follow the top correlations with the goal of keeping TMAO
[875.32s]  as low as possible and avoiding its age-related increase.
[879.30s]  Now I should mention too that for the 7-day period before testing,
[882.98s]  I actually averaged a lot more garlic, 5.7 grams per day.
[887.18s]  So whether it takes 60 days of eating 2.9 grams per day,
[890.98s]  or only 7 days of eating close to 6 grams per day,
[894.40s]  we'll find out for test number 22.
[896.28s]  In terms of did it work, when I sent that test for analysis,
[900.16s]  that was for a December 26 test, 2025,
[903.50s]  and it takes about a month for those results to come in,
[906.00s]  which are then posted first on Patreon.
[908.10s]  So if you're interested in that, check it out.
[910.18s]  If you've ever wondered what's optimal for biomarkers,
[912.56s]  well I have a new Patreon tier dedicated specifically to that.
[915.90s]  It currently includes the 35 biomarkers shown here,
[918.78s]  more than 2 hours of video content,
[920.88s]  52 published references,
[922.50s]  and these aren't the reference ranges which you can get from any LLM these days.
[925.96s]  This is what may be optimal based on how each of these biomarkers changes during aging,
[930.14s]  and their associations, and or their associations with all-cause mortality risk,
[934.04s]  in the largest studies that exist.
