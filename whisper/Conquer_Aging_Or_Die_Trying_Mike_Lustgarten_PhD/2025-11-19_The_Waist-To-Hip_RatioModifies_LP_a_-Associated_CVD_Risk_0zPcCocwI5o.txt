[0.48s]  Lipoprotein A is six times more atherogenic than LDL, and that's what we'll see here.
[5.72s]  On the y-axis, we've got the genetic effect on CHD, or coronary heart disease risk,
[11.40s]  and that's plotted against the genetic effect on ApoB, and more specifically,
[16.08s]  when ApoB is attached to either LDL or lipoprotein A.
[20.16s]  So when compared with risk when ApoB comes from LDL, as shown there,
[24.58s]  risk when ApoB comes from lipoprotein A is six times higher relative to LDL,
[30.20s]  which again goes back to the initial premise of lipoprotein A is six times more atherogenic than LDL.
[36.98s]  So there may be ways to reduce this risk, and one way may include high-sensitivity C-reactive protein,
[43.14s]  specifically low levels, as that mediates lipoprotein A-associated CBD risk,
[49.24s]  and I covered that in an earlier video, and if you missed it, it'll be in the right corner.
[52.84s]  But there may be another way to reduce lipoprotein A-associated cardiovascular disease risk,
[59.82s]  and that way involves the waist-to-hip ratio, which modifies lipoprotein A-associated CBD risk,
[66.56s]  which is what we'll see here.
[68.36s]  On the y-axis, we've got the cumulative incidence of having an ASCVD event,
[73.80s]  so atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease event.
[77.00s]  And for ASCVD events, they included myocardial infarction, so having a heart attack,
[83.00s]  having to be resuscitated from cardiac arrest, so when the heart stops beating,
[87.00s]  coronary heart disease, angina, which is chest pain, or stroke.
[91.12s]  And then that was plotted against follow-up time in years, up to 20 years later,
[95.72s]  after the initial assessment of lipoprotein A and the waist-to-hip ratio.
[99.86s]  All right, so now we can ask that question.
[102.88s]  Is lipoprotein A-associated ASCVD risk higher in people with a relatively low waist-to-hip ratio?
[109.76s]  We're going to have two groups for lipoprotein A, lower than 50 milligrams per deciliter,
[114.68s]  which is quote-unquote low in blue, and relatively high lipoprotein A in red,
[119.36s]  greater than 50 milligrams per deciliter.
[121.76s]  And in terms of the waist-to-hip ratio,
[123.62s]  it included people with an average waist-to-hip ratio of 0.83.
[128.58s]  In terms of the cumulative incident curves, the blue and the red lines,
[132.40s]  we can see that they overlap,
[134.18s]  such that there was no significant difference between the cumulative incident rate
[137.80s]  for people that had high or low lipoprotein A in conjunction with a low waist-to-hip ratio.
[143.84s]  So from this, we can conclude that CVD risk is not relatively higher in people
[148.22s]  who have a high lipoprotein A relative to low lipoprotein A and a low waist-to-hip ratio.
[154.74s]  All right, so these were the lowest waist-to-hip ratios in the study.
[158.80s]  What about at higher waist-to-hip ratios?
[161.62s]  So now we're going to take a look at data for people who had an average waist-to-hip ratio of 0.93.
[167.04s]  Again, same setup, low lipoprotein A in blue, relatively high in red.
[171.82s]  And then here too, we can see that the cumulative incident rates for AS-CVD events over that 20-year span
[178.72s]  overlapped.
[179.96s]  In other words, there was no significant difference between cumulative incident rates
[183.98s]  whether someone had low or high lipoprotein A and a relatively low waist-to-hip ratio with an average of 0.93.
[191.72s]  So from this, here too, we can conclude that CVD risk is not relatively higher in people
[196.66s]  with relatively high lipoprotein A greater than 50 mg per deciliter
[200.80s]  and an intermediate waist-to-hip ratio.
[204.42s]  All right, so how high can we go for the waist-to-hip ratio?
[207.02s]  And is this effect still significant?
[209.46s]  So now we're going to take a look at data for people who had an average waist-to-hip ratio of 1.0.
[214.72s]  And when compared with the low lipoprotein A group,
[217.48s]  now we can see that there is indeed some separation for cumulative incident rates.
[221.30s]  And you can see by the log rank p-value, they are significantly different.
[225.98s]  In other words, people who had a relatively high lipoprotein A,
[229.32s]  greater than 50 mg per deciliter,
[231.70s]  and for both groups that had a waist-to-hip ratio of 1.0,
[236.42s]  their cumulative incident rates of having an ASCVD event was significantly higher
[241.56s]  than people who had low lipoprotein A,
[243.78s]  less than 50 mg per deciliter,
[245.84s]  and also that 1.0 average waist-to-hip ratio.
[248.98s]  So from these data, we can see that CVD risk is indeed higher in people who have a high,
[254.88s]  relatively high lipoprotein A,
[256.58s]  greater than or equal to 50 mg per deciliter,
[258.94s]  and a high waist-to-hip ratio.
[261.80s]  So what does this all mean?
[264.00s]  Well, if your lipoprotein A is greater than 50 mg per deciliter,
[267.90s]  get lean.
[268.76s]  And what that'll do is it'll reduce waist circumference,
[272.02s]  which is one part of the waist-to-hip ratio.
[273.96s]  The other part is hip.
[276.14s]  So in order to maximize or optimize hip circumference,
[280.12s]  regular strength training,
[281.30s]  including squats, deadlifts, and other compound movements,
[284.50s]  would help resist any age-related decline for hip circumference.
[288.10s]  And the goal there should then be to get the waist-to-hip ratio to less than 0.93
[293.22s]  if one has a lipoprotein A value that's greater than 50 mg per deciliter,
[297.82s]  as waist-to-hip ratio is less than 0.93.
[300.24s]  We're not associated with an increased ASCVD risk,
[303.64s]  regardless of lipoprotein A values.
[306.30s]  If you've ever wondered what's optimal for biomarkers,
[308.80s]  well, I have a new Patreon tier dedicated specifically to that.
[311.98s]  It currently includes the 35 biomarkers shown here,
[315.16s]  more than 2 hours of video content,
[317.14s]  52 published references,
[318.88s]  and note that these aren't the reference ranges.
[321.12s]  It's what may be optimal based on the largest studies that exist
[324.04s]  for how each of these biomarkers changes during aging
[326.72s]  and or associations with all-cause mortality risk.
[329.80s]  So if you're interested in that, check it out.
