[0.56s]  Uric acid, as shown here, can act as an antioxidant, but also as a pro-oxidant.
[6.80s]  It's involved in anti-inflammatory mechanisms, but also pro-inflammatory mechanisms.
[12.76s]  So with that in mind, what's optimal for uric acid?
[16.04s]  In today's video, we'll take a look at how uric acid changes during aging, what its association
[21.36s]  is with all-cause mortality risk, and then we'll look at N of 1 data as I have 48 blood
[27.08s]  tests for uric acid with tracked dietary data.
[30.96s]  So first, uric acid levels increase during aging, and that's what we can see here.
[35.66s]  On the y-axis, we've got circulating levels of uric acid plotted against age on the X, and
[40.64s]  this is from 20 to 80 years old.
[43.24s]  So first, starting with the data for men, and note that this study included more than 85,000
[48.36s]  men.
[49.36s]  If anyone's come across studies with a larger sample size for both men and women, using
[53.56s]  the aging data and the all-cause mortality data that I'm going to present, please post
[57.70s]  those studies in the video's comments.
[59.60s]  I'd be happy to use that in a future video.
[62.30s]  So for men, we can see with the red arrows that there's a continuous increase for uric
[66.22s]  acid during aging.
[68.02s]  For women, the story's a bit less clear.
[70.68s]  Flat to a small decline up until about 38 years, after which there's a continuous increase
[76.64s]  for uric acid levels during aging in women.
[79.18s]  All right, so what about all-cause mortality risk?
[82.30s]  And that's what we can see here.
[83.50s]  This study included more than 425,000 people.
[86.66s]  On the y-axis, we've got the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality, or risk of death for
[91.38s]  all causes, plotted against circulating levels of uric acid.
[95.56s]  And in this study, lowest all-cause mortality risk was associated with uric acid levels of 300
[100.70s]  micromolar, which is equivalent to 5 milligrams per deciliter.
[104.00s]  So now we can address the question, what's optimal for uric acid, by combining the data
[109.88s]  from these two studies.
[111.92s]  300 micromolar would be what we'd expect to find in a 20-year-old man and at lowest all-cause
[118.82s]  mortality risk.
[119.90s]  So a good target for men could be 300 micromolar, or 5 milligrams per deciliter.
[125.80s]  But note that 300 micromolar would be what we'd expect to find in a woman of older age, approximately
[132.26s]  80 years old, so that may not be a good target for women.
[135.82s]  In contrast, youthful levels of uric acid in women are around 225 micromolar, or 3.8
[142.46s]  milligrams per deciliter.
[144.08s]  So how does that value compare against all-cause mortality risk?
[147.40s]  And we can see that it's pretty close to lowest risk.
[150.18s]  It's pretty close on the bottom of that J-shaped curve.
[153.60s]  So in terms of what's optimal for women, a good target could be right around 225 micromolar,
[158.98s]  or 3.8 milligrams per deciliter.
[161.24s]  But regardless if you're a man or a woman, it's important to avoid the age-related increase
[166.34s]  for uric acid.
[167.94s]  And that's because when looking at the all-cause mortality data, we can see that values greater
[172.58s]  than about 375 micromolar are associated with a significantly increased all-cause mortality
[177.82s]  risk, as indicated by those red arrows.
[180.76s]  But it is possible to also be too low for uric acid.
[184.96s]  So for that, we put up a red line at a hazard ratio of zero.
[188.12s]  And where the 95% confidence interval, that shaded black line, is completely above that,
[193.74s]  we have a significant association with all-cause mortality risk.
[197.06s]  And that's true when uric acid is less than 175 micromolar, or 2.9 milligrams per deciliter.
[203.62s]  So for uric acid, avoid the age-related increase, but also avoid levels that are too low, less
[208.68s]  than 175 micromolar, or 2.9 milligrams per deciliter.
[212.38s]  All right, so that brings us to part three, what's my data?
[216.90s]  So thus far, I've resisted the age-related uric acid increase.
[221.18s]  And that's what we can see here with data for 48 tests from 2015 to 2024.
[227.86s]  On the y-axis, we've got uric acid levels in milligrams per deciliter plotted against age.
[233.44s]  And here we can see that there is a significant inverse correlation
[236.72s]  between uric acid with age over these 48 blood tests since 2015, with a correlation coefficient
[243.40s]  of negative 0.51.
[245.54s]  And at p-value, that's less than 0.05 as the measure of significance.
[249.64s]  So then the big question is how?
[252.20s]  So for those who may not be familiar with my approach, since 2015, I've weighed all my food
[257.44s]  using a food scale.
[258.76s]  I then enter those food amounts into Cronometer.
[261.44s]  And if you want to track your own diet, there's a discount link for Cronometer in the video's
[265.30s]  description.
[265.58s]  And then I manually enter the Cronometer data into a spreadsheet.
[270.32s]  So then each blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake.
[274.08s]  In other words, if there's a 60-day period in between blood tests, because I'm tracking
[278.16s]  dietary intake, the average of those 60 days corresponds to the latter test.
[283.22s]  So every blood test then has a corresponding average dietary intake.
[287.04s]  And with enough track data for both blood tests and diet or supplements, I can look at correlations.
[292.38s]  And then I calculate those correlations for diet with biomarkers.
[296.78s]  And then with the goal of improving biomarkers, I follow as many of the significant correlations
[301.28s]  as possible.
[302.44s]  And that's the major way that I've been able to resist the age-related decline for uric
[307.38s]  acid and improve other biomarkers too, if you're familiar with the channel.
[310.68s]  All right, so now we're going to take a look at 94 comparisons for uric acid with both food
[316.14s]  and macro and micronutrients.
[318.52s]  So let's start off with dietary correlations with lower levels of uric acid.
[323.16s]  And that's what we can see here.
[324.76s]  On the left, we've got the food or nutrient.
[327.72s]  Then we've got the p-value.
[328.94s]  And note that everything on this list has a p-value less than 0.05 as the measure of
[333.90s]  significance.
[335.38s]  And this is a partial list.
[337.40s]  There are actually 21 significant inverse correlations for foods or nutrients with uric
[342.64s]  acid.
[343.04s]  So this is a short list.
[344.18s]  It's too big to fit on the slide.
[346.56s]  If you're interested in the full list, that data is on the correlations tier on Patreon.
[351.20s]  And then for the lowercase n to the right, that's the number of tests.
[354.66s]  So for macros and micronutrients, I have data for 48 tests because I've been tracking that
[359.76s]  since 2015.
[361.50s]  It wasn't until 2018 that I decided to start tracking food intake because the macros and
[366.22s]  micros are a reductionist version of actually tracking food.
[370.84s]  So starting in 2018, I started tracking food and the macros and micros.
[374.48s]  But unfortunately, I only have tracked data for 34 tests that correspond to biomarkers.
[379.74s]  And then we've got the lowercase r, which is the correlation coefficient.
[383.08s]  And you can see that everything on the list is negative.
[385.80s]  In other words, relatively higher levels of the nutrient or food is significantly correlated
[390.76s]  with lower uric acid.
[393.02s]  And then just going through some of the foods or nutrients on this list, they include black
[396.60s]  pepper, ginger, turmeric, Brazil nuts, and so on down the list.
[401.14s]  All right.
[401.38s]  What about dietary correlations with higher uric acid?
[404.78s]  And that's what we can see here.
[406.50s]  So same setup, p-value, all of these on the list, less than 0.05.
[410.74s]  And then note that this too is a partial list as 23 foods or nutrients were significantly
[416.56s]  positively correlated with uric acid.
[419.86s]  And then we've got the correlation coefficient.
[422.46s]  And again, note that all of the data in that column are positive.
[425.52s]  In other words, relatively higher levels of foods or nutrients on this list are significantly
[430.62s]  correlated with higher uric acid.
[432.62s]  And then in terms of some that are on the list, total fructose, net carbs, vitamin E, oxalate,
[439.16s]  cacao beans, all of those are significantly correlated with a higher uric acid level in
[443.44s]  my data over those 48 tests.
[446.14s]  But that brings us to calorie intake.
[449.02s]  So are any of these foods or nutrients even making an impact or a potential dent?
[454.20s]  Is it just calorie intake?
[455.44s]  Because this data would suggest that relatively higher calories is significantly correlated with
[460.54s]  higher uric acid.
[461.44s]  So maybe that's the driving factor behind any or all of these correlations.
[466.76s]  So is that true?
[468.28s]  Are any of these correlations significant after adjusting for calorie intake?
[472.88s]  So to address that, I then created linear regression models adjusted for calorie intake.
[478.34s]  So let's just go through one as an example for black pepper.
[482.04s]  And that's what we can see here.
[483.26s]  So now we've got two variables in the model, black pepper and calories.
[486.74s]  In other words, is black pepper significantly associated with uric acid after adjusting for
[491.68s]  calorie intake?
[493.36s]  And that's what we can see there with the calories in the model.
[496.66s]  And after doing that, we can see that the coefficient is still negative, 0.5, and the p-value
[501.44s]  is less than 0.05.
[502.96s]  In other words, yes.
[503.94s]  After adjusting for calorie intake, black pepper is still significantly correlated with a
[508.42s]  lower uric acid.
[509.24s]  So in this case, calorie intake is not driving that association.
[513.26s]  So then we put up the calorie adjusted p-values for first for black pepper.
[518.28s]  And then going through the list, the ones in green are still significant after including
[523.00s]  calorie intake after adjusting for calorie intake in the model.
[526.42s]  Just outside significance are pistachios, strawberries, and serrano peppers.
[530.18s]  As you can see that their calorie adjusted p-value is higher than 0.05, as are mushrooms at 0.19.
[537.24s]  All right, so using the same approach for the foods or nutrients that were significantly correlated
[542.10s]  with higher uric acid, a few popped up.
[546.02s]  So total fructose, net carbs, vitamin E, cacao beans, and vanilla beans were still positively
[551.74s]  associated with uric acid after adjusting for calorie intake.
[556.04s]  But others on the list dropped out.
[559.62s]  So now we can see which foods or nutrients may impact uric acid after accounting for calorie
[565.22s]  intake, both positively and negatively.
[567.54s]  And then the goal would be to follow as many of these correlations as possible with the goal
[571.48s]  of keeping uric acid relatively low.
[574.68s]  All right, that's all for now.
