[0.32s]  Surgical fat removal in rats extends lifespan, and that's what we'll see here.
[5.88s]  On the y-axis, we've got percent survival, and that's plotted against age on the x.
[10.62s]  In terms of survival, let's put up a red line at median survival.
[14.48s]  This is the time when half of the colony has died and half is still alive.
[18.50s]  And when compared with the control group, animals that had their visceral fat surgically removed
[23.00s]  had a significant extension for median lifespan.
[26.32s]  But note that this isn't the longest lifespan on this curve.
[29.36s]  And that was for 40% calorie restriction.
[32.68s]  Interestingly, note that calorie restriction reduces visceral fat,
[36.42s]  which suggests that the lifespan extension that's caused by visceral fat removal
[40.38s]  contributes to the overall lifespan extending effect for calorie restriction.
[45.62s]  All right, so what about maximal lifespan?
[47.64s]  That's what we'll see there at 20% survival.
[50.30s]  Now 80% of the colony has died, and only 20% is still alive.
[54.48s]  But the story is similar.
[55.88s]  So, this is the only test that I have.
[57.26s]  Visceral fat removal extended maximal lifespan.
[59.48s]  But note that the longest lifespan increase was for calorie restriction.
[63.50s]  So, taken together, we can see that visceral fat removal extends both median and maximal lifespan.
[69.10s]  Okay, what's my data?
[70.70s]  This isn't just a health and longevity news channel.
[73.82s]  This is a health and longevity news optimization channel too.
[76.90s]  So, how am I doing on this journey?
[79.76s]  So, to find out, I had DEXA performed as shown there in the right corner.
[83.56s]  And this isn't the only test that I have.
[85.50s]  I have data going back to previous years.
[87.68s]  So, a total of three tests over that three-year period.
[90.72s]  First, in looking at the big picture.
[93.04s]  And this picture is color-coded, which includes bone, lean mass, and fat mass, which is in blue.
[98.84s]  In terms of the demographics.
[100.56s]  So, for this test, I was almost 53 years old.
[104.16s]  In terms of my height, 5'7 or 1.7 meters.
[108.48s]  In terms of my body weight, even though it says 140 pounds.
[111.40s]  That's what the DEXA technician asked me how much I weighed on that day.
[115.32s]  But my body weight scale fasted first thing in the morning was 138.8 pounds, which is 62.7 kilograms.
[122.26s]  And this is for a December 2025 test.
[125.28s]  And note that these data have been on Patreon for about a month.
[127.58s]  So, if you're interested in seeing the data as soon as they come out, check us out over there.
[131.94s]  Alright, so in terms of visceral fat, on this day, it was 0.28 pounds or 127 grams.
[138.26s]  But this is just the number.
[139.68s]  Let's put that number into perspective by comparing it against age-expected data.
[144.66s]  Which is what we'll see here.
[146.12s]  And this is data in men.
[147.62s]  And note that visceral fat mass, VFM, levels in women.
[151.24s]  I covered that in an earlier video.
[152.68s]  And if you missed it, I'll link to it in the right corner.
[154.72s]  So, for this plot, we've got VFM, or visceral fat mass, in grams, plotted against age on the X.
[162.24s]  And then we can see that visceral fat mass increases during aging from 25 to around 65 years of age.
[168.50s]  Which then plateaus after 65.
[171.56s]  Okay, so now we can put my 0.28 pounds or 127 grams into perspective by comparing it against the population-based medians or averages.
[180.60s]  And for that, we can see that 127 grams is below the age-expected chronological age median.
[187.66s]  And if you look at the lowest level, the gray line, I would be at the lowest level for visceral fat for any age group.
[194.94s]  Going all the way back to 20 years of age.
[197.46s]  So, this is good news.
[199.18s]  In terms of what's expected based on chronological age, we can see that that's somewhere around 1300 grams.
[204.92s]  So, my chronological age being around 53, median values for visceral fat around 1300 grams.
[212.44s]  So, for this test, I'm about 10 times lower than what's expected based on chronological age.
[218.58s]  So, this is good news.
[220.18s]  But note that this is just one test.
[222.42s]  And when considering the animal data, the goal is to keep visceral fat as low as possible for as long as possible.
[228.20s]  So, with that in mind, the longevity goal when it comes to visceral fat is to avoid an age-related increase.
[234.08s]  So, how well am I doing relative to that goal?
[236.48s]  As I have, again, data going back now to 2 plus years.
[240.12s]  Which is what we'll see here.
[242.04s]  So, for a December 2023 test.
[244.24s]  And note that I've decided to test at the same time of year every year.
[248.52s]  And just to be consistent.
[249.80s]  There's no special magical reason why I picked December.
[252.46s]  The first test was in December of 2023.
[254.42s]  So, for consistency, I'll do it in December of 2023.
[258.14s]  Around the 20th.
[259.12s]  So, 15th to the 20th.
[260.52s]  For all tests going forward.
[262.26s]  Also note that I standardized the conditions under which I'm measuring.
[266.40s]  Almost all food intake is consumed by 8 a.m.
[269.36s]  So, I've got about a 3-hour window.
[271.40s]  3-4 hour window.
[272.60s]  If I stop by 7 a.m.
[274.14s]  3-4 hour window where there's no food, no water.
[277.32s]  I've done that for each of these 3 tests.
[279.20s]  In order to standardize how much food I have in the system.
[282.18s]  And how hydrated I am prior to testing.
[284.72s]  So, for the first test in December of 2023.
[287.72s]  Visceral fat mass was 0.58 pounds or 263 grams.
[292.14s]  And then I measured in December or December 18th, 2024.
[295.88s]  And we can see two measurements.
[297.74s]  Now, I was able to convince the DEXA technician.
[300.60s]  To measure immediately one after the other DEXA scans.
[304.64s]  And that's because I wanted to see what's the test to test variability.
[308.02s]  For measuring immediately one right after the other.
[310.52s]  And we can see that there is significant variability.
[313.86s]  On the first measurement, it was 0.8 pounds.
[316.28s]  And on the second measurement, 0.59 pounds.
[318.74s]  So, a 0.21 pound difference.
[321.06s]  Which is a pretty big gap.
[322.92s]  So, how I handle that is I've taken the average.
[325.90s]  Now, this applies to almost all measurements.
[328.68s]  If I'm measuring fasting morning glucose using finger prick.
[331.54s]  Two measurements.
[332.30s]  In the past, I used three.
[333.40s]  But that burns a lot of test strips.
[335.50s]  So, at least two measurements.
[337.40s]  And then taking the average.
[338.38s]  Also, for ketosis, measuring beta-hydroxybutyrate.
[341.94s]  Also in the morning, I'm using two test strips.
[344.10s]  And then taking the average.
[345.40s]  And this will help minimize test-to-test variability.
[348.44s]  As we're taking the average of at least two measurements for every test.
[352.72s]  So, visceral fat in 2024 moved in the wrong direction.
[355.76s]  316 grams.
[357.70s]  Then, putting the most recent test into perspective.
[360.60s]  For the December 2025 test.
[362.68s]  We can see that 0.28 pounds and 127 grams.
[365.74s]  Is my best data to date.
[367.60s]  Over these three tests.
[369.14s]  Over this three-year period.
[370.76s]  So, in terms of that longevity goal.
[372.78s]  At least for this year.
[374.00s]  This is good news.
[375.06s]  As I've pretty much reversed that age-related trend.
[377.74s]  Moving in the wrong direction.
[378.82s]  But again, this is just three tests.
[380.54s]  This is just a three-year span.
[382.12s]  I'm in this for the long game.
[383.36s]  70 plus years and beyond.
[385.20s]  So, the goal is to keep it at 127 grams or lower.
[388.74s]  For every test going forward.
[390.56s]  So, then the big question is how.
[392.08s]  How was I able to reduce visceral fat?
[394.38s]  First insight comes from body weight.
[396.46s]  For the first test in 2023.
[398.24s]  Body weight on the morning of testing.
[399.96s]  Was 140.5 pounds.
[402.22s]  And again, that's at home.
[403.36s]  Using my body weight scale.
[404.82s]  Which I measure every day.
[405.92s]  I measure body weight every day.
[407.00s]  Going back for 10 years.
[409.04s]  Alright, so in 2024.
[410.34s]  On the morning of the test.
[411.32s]  It was about one pound heavier.
[413.98s]  141.4 pounds.
[415.92s]  Now, that might not seem like a big difference.
[418.42s]  Just 0.9 pounds.
[419.88s]  But we can see that visceral fat moved.
[421.72s]  In the wrong direction.
[423.40s]  For just a one pound increase.
[425.20s]  Year over year.
[426.78s]  Alright, so for the most recent test.
[428.42s]  In 2025.
[429.44s]  We can see that my body weight.
[430.62s]  On the morning of the test.
[431.68s]  Was the lowest.
[432.64s]  Over this three-year period.
[434.28s]  138.8 pounds.
[435.62s]  And that's in association.
[437.66s]  With my lowest visceral fat.
[439.48s]  Over that three-year period.
[440.54s]  So now note this interesting trend.
[443.62s]  When my body weight was at its lowest.
[445.34s]  I saw my lowest visceral fat.
[446.96s]  Not by little.
[447.64s]  By a lot.
[448.32s]  Cutting visceral fat by more than half.
[450.84s]  Relative to 140.5 pounds.
[453.96s]  140.5 pounds is intermediate.
[456.74s]  And we can also see that visceral fat is intermediate.
[459.48s]  263.
[460.38s]  Relative to the highest visceral fat here.
[462.56s]  316 grams.
[463.80s]  Which is also in conjunction with my highest body weight.
[466.32s]  Now note that this is only a three pound range.
[469.74s]  In order to see visceral fat.
[471.58s]  That's about a third relative to my highest values.
[474.82s]  So it suggests that even within being relatively lean.
[477.94s]  Getting even slightly leaner.
[479.70s]  Within a three pound range.
[481.12s]  Can potentially make a big dent on visceral fat.
[483.84s]  But this may be only part of the story.
[486.00s]  We can also take a look at body fat.
[488.10s]  As body fat percentage.
[489.36s]  BF percentage.
[490.52s]  Is associated with visceral fat.
[492.34s]  Which is what we'll see here.
[493.52s]  This is the population based average for visceral fat mass.
[496.94s]  Plotted against body fat percentage on the X.
[499.98s]  And for both men in blue.
[501.42s]  And women in red.
[502.36s]  We can see that as the body fat percentage increases.
[505.06s]  That's significantly associated with a higher level of visceral fat mass.
[509.22s]  Or VFM.
[510.64s]  So for very low levels of body fat.
[513.36s]  That would be associated with very low visceral fat mass.
[516.68s]  Okay.
[517.18s]  What's my data?
[518.50s]  So now let's pull up that table from before.
[520.48s]  And now we're going to take a look at body fat percentage.
[522.60s]  For each of these three tests.
[524.60s]  For the first test.
[525.48s]  It was 14%.
[526.68s]  For the second test.
[527.98s]  The average of those two tests.
[529.34s]  It was 15.45%.
[531.08s]  And I should mention.
[532.04s]  I tried to get the DEXA technician to measure twice.
[534.54s]  For the 2025 test.
[536.54s]  But no luck.
[538.26s]  They said I'd have to come back the next day.
[540.16s]  And I wasn't interested in doing that.
[541.52s]  I wanted to get test to test immediately right after.
[544.42s]  All right.
[544.64s]  Nonetheless.
[545.22s]  Body fat percentage on the most recent test.
[547.70s]  Was my lowest over this three year span.
[549.90s]  11.9%.
[550.94s]  So just like the body weight data.
[553.16s]  Note again.
[553.70s]  An interesting trend.
[555.22s]  When my body fat percentage was at its lowest over these three tests.
[558.20s]  11.9%.
[559.24s]  I saw my lowest visceral fat.
[561.54s]  When my body fat percentage was at its highest level over these three tests.
[565.30s]  15.45%.
[566.54s]  That was associated with my highest visceral fat mass.
[570.16s]  316 grams.
[571.44s]  And for an intermediate level of body fat percentage.
[574.56s]  14%.
[575.52s]  I saw an intermediate level of visceral fat mass.
[578.24s]  263 grams.
[580.52s]  So if the goal is to reduce visceral fat.
[582.98s]  Weight loss.
[583.96s]  And specifically reducing body fat percentage.
[586.42s]  Is important.
[586.98s]  But this may only be part of the story.
[588.60s]  Although this is probably the big major guts of the story.
[591.86s]  What about diet?
[592.70s]  How does diet factor into this story?
[595.00s]  Now before going into that.
[596.70s]  You could say.
[597.82s]  The diet that helps you get to your lowest body fat percentage.
[600.46s]  May be a part of seeing you achieve.
[602.46s]  Your lowest visceral fat mass.
[604.22s]  But there may be specific foods.
[606.94s]  Or nutrients.
[607.86s]  And or nutrients.
[608.84s]  That can help contribute to lowering visceral fat mass.
[611.44s]  I'm only going to cover a few of them here.
[613.12s]  There may be a very long list.
[614.86s]  And I don't know about causation.
[616.46s]  All I know is what's been published in studies of others.
[618.90s]  And then what my data looks like.
[620.86s]  So first let's start off with walnut consumption.
[624.10s]  In this study.
[624.98s]  People who reported high intakes of walnut consumption.
[627.70s]  That was associated with a 90% reduction for visceral fat mass.
[631.78s]  Throughout the duration of the study.
[633.20s]  All right.
[634.12s]  So rather than just assuming that eating walnuts.
[636.62s]  Will be beneficial for visceral fat mass.
[638.88s]  For those who don't know.
[640.02s]  I've tracked dietary intake with a food scale.
[642.44s]  Weighing almost all of my food.
[644.30s]  More than 99%.
[645.54s]  For 10 years.
[647.52s]  And for those who are unfamiliar.
[648.94s]  This is no joke.
[649.64s]  Literally I have 10 years of Chronometer.
[652.00s]  Which is a diet tracking app.
[653.44s]  If you want to use Chronometer.
[654.56s]  There's a discount link in the video description.
[656.58s]  I've tracked my own diet for 10 years.
[658.68s]  And then I have all of that data in a spreadsheet.
[660.68s]  I've manually entered it for all of those days.
[663.94s]  All right.
[664.12s]  Nonetheless.
[664.84s]  I have walnut intake.
[666.46s]  Full year average walnut intake.
[668.64s]  For each of these three tests.
[670.92s]  14, 7, and 18 grams per day.
[673.78s]  On average.
[674.60s]  In 2023.
[675.74s]  2024.
[676.72s]  2025.
[677.48s]  And again.
[677.80s]  Those are full year averages.
[679.84s]  Now here.
[680.80s]  Note the interesting trend.
[682.34s]  For the most recent test.
[683.74s]  Average walnut intake in 2025.
[685.60s]  Was at my highest.
[686.90s]  And that was associated.
[687.90s]  Or that may be a part of the story.
[690.02s]  For seeing my lowest visceral fat.
[692.12s]  When walnut intake was at its lowest.
[694.50s]  7 grams per day.
[695.68s]  On average.
[696.16s]  In 2024.
[697.08s]  I saw my highest visceral fat mass.
[699.54s]  And then.
[700.12s]  For the intermediate level of walnuts.
[701.78s]  14 grams per day.
[702.78s]  In 2023.
[703.80s]  I saw an intermediate level.
[705.24s]  Of visceral fat mass.
[706.24s]  Now again.
[706.66s]  These are just correlations.
[708.26s]  Or association.
[709.08s]  I don't know about causation.
[711.20s]  But walnuts are a current staple.
[712.94s]  In the approach.
[713.58s]  And I have no plans.
[714.28s]  To take them out anytime soon.
[715.60s]  Especially if they may lower visceral fat mass.
[718.32s]  In my case.
[718.92s]  Maybe others.
[719.56s]  Maybe for others too.
[720.50s]  We'd all have to do the experiment.
[721.82s]  To find out.
[722.96s]  Alright.
[723.12s]  So there may be two other foods.
[724.50s]  That could impact visceral fat mass.
[726.30s]  At least in my case.
[727.94s]  And one of them.
[728.70s]  Is a relatively higher fiber intake.
[731.24s]  So in this study.
[732.26s]  People who are in the highest tertile.
[734.16s]  Of increasing fiber intake.
[735.80s]  Throughout the duration of the study.
[737.22s]  They saw about a 15% reduction.
[739.48s]  For visceral fat mass.
[740.98s]  Okay.
[741.36s]  What's my data over this three year span.
[743.32s]  So average fiber intake.
[745.40s]  Full year average.
[746.64s]  Was 85, 84, and 82 grams per day.
[749.68s]  In each of those three years.
[751.32s]  Now here.
[751.92s]  I don't see any specific trends.
[754.68s]  For example.
[755.38s]  For the most recent test.
[756.78s]  82 grams per day.
[758.04s]  Is not a part.
[759.00s]  Does not seem to be a part.
[760.12s]  Of seeing my lowest visceral fat mass.
[762.36s]  And then for the 85 grams per day.
[764.04s]  That's not a part of seeing.
[765.48s]  Also my lowest visceral fat mass.
[767.44s]  So it seems that in my case.
[769.50s]  That dietary fiber intake.
[770.86s]  Is not a part of the story.
[772.20s]  Or at least within these three tests.
[774.58s]  Is not a part of the story.
[775.90s]  For lowering visceral fat mass.
[777.46s]  Or at least getting it to my lowest level.
[779.46s]  For the most recent test.
[781.04s]  And then a third possibility.
[782.62s]  Is green tea consumption.
[784.34s]  People in this study.
[785.18s]  Who reported more green tea consumption.
[787.26s]  Throughout the duration of the study.
[788.72s]  Saw about a 13% reduction.
[790.48s]  For visceral fat mass.
[791.84s]  Okay.
[792.16s]  What about me?
[793.32s]  So over this three year span.
[794.72s]  It's been pretty much a constant.
[796.26s]  I use loose leaf green tea.
[798.76s]  Organic loose leaf green tea.
[800.08s]  Sourced from Japan.
[800.80s]  There too.
[801.54s]  If you want to use it.
[802.24s]  There's a discount link.
[803.06s]  In the video's description.
[804.54s]  So over this three year span.
[805.58s]  It's pretty much a constant.
[806.56s]  I've used that 10 grams per day.
[808.02s]  In a stainless steel ball.
[809.24s]  And I drink about two and a half cups.
[810.82s]  Around 20 ounces per day.
[812.28s]  So that it's a constant.
[813.58s]  It suggests that.
[814.42s]  That may not been a part of.
[816.18s]  The story.
[816.72s]  For why I was able to reduce.
[818.14s]  Visceral fat mass.
[819.00s]  From 263 and around 300 grams.
[821.62s]  To the most recent test.
[822.74s]  127 grams.
[825.10s]  All right.
[825.28s]  So note that.
[826.24s]  For this test.
[826.90s]  Visceral fat mass of 127 grams.
[829.18s]  Is the lowest amongst 50 year olds.
[831.30s]  In the health and longevity YouTube space.
[833.40s]  And I don't generally make clickbait claims.
[836.30s]  But for this.
[837.14s]  For once.
[837.88s]  Let's follow this rabbit hole.
[839.78s]  So our good friend.
[840.98s]  Brian Johnson.
[841.54s]  At 48 years old.
[843.30s]  For a test that he took.
[844.28s]  In August of 2025.
[845.80s]  Had a visceral fat mass.
[847.20s]  Of 0.56 liters.
[848.90s]  When multiplied.
[849.76s]  By the density of fat.
[851.22s]  That yields a total visceral fat mass.
[853.36s]  Of 504 grams.
[855.06s]  Which is about four times higher.
[856.56s]  Than where I was.
[857.34s]  For this most recent test.
[859.00s]  Now I don't know.
[859.56s]  If this is directly comparable.
[860.78s]  Because Brian used MRI.
[862.32s]  And nonetheless.
[863.20s]  504 grams.
[864.02s]  Is still really low.
[865.34s]  But.
[865.94s]  I'm sorry to say.
[866.84s]  Brian.
[867.10s]  I've got you beat.
[867.76s]  For at least this one test.
[869.54s]  Next up.
[870.32s]  Is Paul Saladino.
[871.54s]  When Paul was 46.
[873.00s]  On his YouTube channel.
[874.06s]  For a December 1st post.
[875.84s]  He reported having 0.3 pounds.
[877.98s]  Of visceral fat.
[878.68s]  Or 136 grams.
[880.66s]  So here too.
[881.68s]  I've got Paul beat.
[882.64s]  At 127 grams.
[884.10s]  Now if we're being totally honest.
[886.02s]  127 grams.
[886.92s]  Is probably not different.
[888.24s]  From 136 grams.
[890.06s]  But what I do want to highlight.
[891.56s]  Is that Brian is vegan.
[893.38s]  And Paul is not.
[895.00s]  Now I'm not trying to say.
[896.12s]  That going vegan.
[896.78s]  Is not optimal for visceral fat.
[898.12s]  By no means am I saying that.
[899.78s]  But what I would like to highlight.
[901.08s]  Is that we can see.
[902.00s]  That having relatively low levels.
[903.60s]  Of visceral fat.
[904.64s]  Regardless if you're vegan.
[906.02s]  Or if you're far from vegan.
[907.90s]  I mean Paul's diet.
[908.58s]  Is more.
[909.42s]  A lot more meat.
[910.40s]  Granted he's got a ton of fruit now.
[911.88s]  But they're total.
[912.78s]  Two totally different diets.
[914.48s]  And very low visceral fat.
[916.08s]  In both of these guys.
[917.42s]  And then there's me.
[918.54s]  With less hair.
[919.72s]  Compared to both of these guys.
[920.88s]  And a goofy smile.
[922.34s]  At 53 years old.
[923.44s]  For this test.
[923.98s]  Or close to 53.
[925.82s]  127 grams.
[926.58s]  I've got them both beat.
[927.80s]  For now.
[928.50s]  I'm not saying.
[929.30s]  It'll be like this forever.
[930.20s]  I'm planning on keeping mine.
[931.74s]  As low as I can.
[932.64s]  And I'm sure both of these guys.
[933.92s]  Will probably be lower than me.
[935.60s]  At some point.
[936.22s]  But it's just fun to compare.
[937.82s]  For this video.
[939.34s]  Now.
[939.66s]  I may actually be.
[940.72s]  In third place.
[941.42s]  Relatively soon.
[942.20s]  For the over 50 year olds.
[943.82s]  And that's because.
[944.54s]  Our good friend Dave Pasco.
[946.02s]  Three years ago.
[946.96s]  On his website.
[948.12s]  He posted having 0.31 pounds.
[950.40s]  Of visceral fat.
[951.22s]  Or 141 grams.
[952.96s]  Now Dave is lean.
[954.08s]  All year round.
[955.12s]  So I'd be shocked.
[955.88s]  If his data.
[956.48s]  Isn't consistently around.
[957.74s]  130 grams.
[958.80s]  Or lower.
[959.92s]  And when Dave posts.
[960.98s]  His most recent DEXA data.
[962.36s]  That I'd be shocked.
[963.08s]  To see that it isn't.
[963.90s]  Better than mine.
[964.92s]  But the person.
[965.70s]  Who may have us all beat.
[966.76s]  Is Tony Ruggia.
[967.90s]  On the I Am Longevity channel.
[970.04s]  So Tony is currently.
[971.02s]  62 years old.
[971.98s]  And super ripped.
[973.06s]  Probably more ripped.
[973.80s]  Than everybody.
[974.80s]  Regardless of.
[975.68s]  Chronological age.
[976.58s]  And he's posted.
[977.86s]  On his channel.
[978.44s]  That he's going to have.
[979.04s]  Full body DEXA done.
[980.36s]  Very soon.
[981.48s]  Maybe even.
[982.28s]  If you're watching this video.
[983.14s]  He's already had it done.
[984.20s]  I'd be shocked.
[984.78s]  If his data.
[985.48s]  Isn't below.
[986.58s]  127 grams.
[987.62s]  For visceral fat.
[988.74s]  And the person.
[989.34s]  Who's got us all beat.
[990.56s]  At least for now.
[991.38s]  Is Seamland.
[992.46s]  On his channel.
[993.38s]  He posted.
[993.88s]  Having only.
[994.66s]  54 grams.
[995.72s]  Of visceral fat.
[996.56s]  If you've ever wondered.
[997.74s]  What's optimal.
[998.28s]  For biomarkers.
[999.22s]  Well I have a new.
[999.94s]  Patreon tier.
[1000.98s]  Dedicated specifically.
[1001.94s]  To that.
[1002.66s]  It currently.

[1009.40s]  That these aren't.
[1010.10s]  The LLM.
[1010.96s]  Generated reference ranges.
[1012.56s]  This is what may be optimal.
[1013.84s]  Based on how.
[1014.46s]  Each of these.
[1015.22s]  Biomarkers.
[1015.70s]  Changes during aging.
[1016.92s]  And or.
[1017.68s]  Associations with.
