[0.00s]  In the fed state, or after eating, blood glucose levels increase, which acts as a stimulus on
[6.46s]  pancreatic beta cells to release insulin. Blood levels of insulin then rise, which acts as a
[12.44s]  signal on target tissues, including the liver, fat, and muscle to take up glucose from the blood,
[17.96s]  thereby reducing blood levels of glucose and helping to maintain glucose within a normal
[22.04s]  homeostatic range. Now, the importance of glucose and insulin during aging is illustrated by the
[27.76s]  finding that calorie-restricted animals have lower levels of glucose and insulin throughout their
[32.74s]  lifespan. And this is thought to be one reason why calorie-restricted animals live longer,
[37.22s]  have significant increases for average and maximal lifespan. But this may only be half of the
[42.86s]  equation in terms of glucose and insulin for extending lifespan. And the other half of that
[47.90s]  involves fasting. So note that calorie-restricted mice eat almost all of their food within a very
[53.60s]  short window so that they fast on a daily basis, up to 21 to 22 hours per day. So why is that
[60.80s]  important? Well, during prolonged fasting, that also impacts blood levels of glucose, which decline.
[67.72s]  The decline for blood glucose then acts as a signal on pancreatic alpha cells to release glucagon.
[73.56s]  Glucagon levels rise in the blood, which then acts as a signal for the liver to break down stored glycogen,
[79.64s]  converting it into glucose, which is then released into the blood and thereby helping to maintain blood
[85.52s]  levels of glucose, again, within that normal homeostatic range. Now, the importance of glucagon
[91.08s]  and correspondingly prolonged fasting in this equation is that glucagon signaling is required for
[96.56s]  the lifespan-extending effect of calorie restriction, which is what we'll see here. These data come from a
[101.72s]  recently published paper, and if you're interested in checking out the paper, it'll be in the video
[105.40s]  description. On the waxes, we've got percent survival, and that's plotted against lifespan or days alive on
[111.10s]  the X. In terms of who was alive and who had died, we put up a red line at 50% survival. At that time
[118.14s]  point, half the mice had died and half were still alive. And right away, we can see that for one of those
[123.34s]  groups, half of the mice had died, and that's the GCGRKOCR. What does that mean? Cali-restricted,
[130.68s]  glucagon receptor knockout mice. So these were mice that were calorie-restricted that had their
[135.80s]  glucagon receptor knocked out in all tissues. And then correspondingly, there is no intracellular
[141.34s]  glucagon signaling in any of those tissues. On the other hand, we can see that all mice that were
[146.98s]  calorie-restricted but that had functional glucagon receptors were all still alive. So from these data,
[152.84s]  we can conclude that glucagon signaling is required or essential for the lifespan-extending
[157.74s]  effect of calorie restriction. So what does this mean? Can we translate this or potentially
[162.22s]  translate this into people? Well, when considering that calorie-restricted mice fast for the majority
[167.40s]  of the day, 21 to 22 hours, and prolonged intraday fasting can increase blood levels of glucagon,
[174.64s]  it then raises the question, will calorie-restricted plus fasting maximize lifespan of people? In other
[180.64s]  words, just being calorie-restricted may not be enough for the average and maximal lifespan-extending
[186.36s]  effect of calorie restriction, fasting may be a part of this equation or a big part of this equation.
[192.14s]  If you've ever wondered what's optimal for biomarkers, we'll have a new Patreon tier dedicated
[196.26s]  specifically to that. It currently includes the 35 biomarkers shown here, more than two hours of video
[201.78s]  content, 52 published references. And these aren't the reference ranges which you can get from any LLM.
[208.48s]  This is what may be optimal for each biomarker based on how they change during aging and or
[213.38s]  associations with all-cause mortality risk and the largest published studies that exist.
[217.90s]  So if you're interested in that, check it out. If you're interested in more about my attempts to
[222.12s]  biohack aging, check us out on Patreon, where I offer blood test consults and post at least twice per
[227.10s]  day in four other Patreon tiers. We've also got a whole bunch of discount and affiliate links that
[231.92s]  you can use to test yourself that help support the channel, including ultalabtest.com, which is where I
[237.02s]  get the majority of my blood tests done, clearly filtered water filter, at-home metabolomics,
[241.70s]  oral microbiome composition, NAD testing with Genfinity, epigenetic testing with TrueDiagnostic,
[247.56s]  at-home blood testing with Cyfox Health, green tea, diet tracking with chronometer,
[251.80s]  or if you'd like to support the channel, you can do that with the website, buy me a coffee.
[255.14s]  We've also got merch, including Data is My North Star, Figuring Stuff Out is My Drug,
