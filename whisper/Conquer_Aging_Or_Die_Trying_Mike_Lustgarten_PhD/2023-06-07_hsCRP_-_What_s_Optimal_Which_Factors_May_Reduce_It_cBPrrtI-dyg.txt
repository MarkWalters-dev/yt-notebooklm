[0.64s]  High Sensitivity C Reactor Protein, or HSCRP, increases during aging, and that's what we
[6.96s]  can see here, with levels of CRP on the y-axis plotted against age, starting with 18 year
[12.32s]  olds on the left, all the way up through people who are older than 70 on the right.
[16.88s]  In youth, average CRP levels are 0.8 mg per liter.
[21.08s]  And then we can see the age-related increase, such that people who are older than 70 have
[25.36s]  average CRP values that are double that, 1.6 mg per liter.
[30.04s]  Now the age-related increase for CRP is potentially important because a relatively higher CRP,
[36.04s]  or level of CRP, is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.
[39.92s]  And that's what we can see here.
[41.98s]  This is a meta-analysis of 27 studies that included more than 480,000 people for the association
[48.46s]  between all-cause mortality risk with HSCRP.
[52.40s]  Now in terms of what's significant, we put up the dashed red line at a hazard ratio of
[56.44s]  1, and note that when the dashed black lines, that's the 95% confidence interval, when that's
[62.14s]  completely above or below 1, we have a statistically significant association.
[67.78s]  Now in this case, we can see that that's true for CRP that's greater than 1 mg per liter.
[73.72s]  So as CRP increases, we can see that increased association for all-cause mortality risk.
[79.28s]  Now in youth, you can see that the upper limit of the range for CRP is about 1 mg per liter,
[86.02s]  which then raises the question, is less than 1 mg per liter optimal for HSCRP?
[92.06s]  So for that, we go back to the all-cause mortality plot, more specifically within the 0 to 1 mg
[96.84s]  per liter range.
[98.38s]  And there, we can see that HSCRP does indeed increase above 0 up until the 1 mg per liter
[105.12s]  range.
[106.12s]  And that's a significant increase, as you can see that both of the dashed black lines are
[110.20s]  completely above 1.
[111.76s]  In other words, for all-cause mortality risk, as close to 0 as possible may be optimal for
[117.16s]  HSCRP.
[118.12s]  Now, with these data in mind, what can reduce HSCRP?
[123.00s]  So first, let's take a look at which foods are significantly correlated with lower levels
[127.02s]  of HSCRP.
[128.84s]  And as a quick side step, in terms of looking at food correlations with HSCRP, let's detail
[133.74s]  the approach that I'm going to go through in this video.
[136.52s]  So every day since April of 2015, I've weighed all of my food prior to intake using a food scale.
[141.80s]  I then entered that data into Chronometer.
[144.18s]  And if you're interested in using Chronometer, there'll be a discount link in the video's
[147.36s]  description.
[148.36s]  And then because each blood test since 2015 has a corresponding average diet composition,
[153.46s]  I can then calculate correlations for diet, including macro and micronutrients and individual
[158.56s]  foods with blood biomarkers.
[160.46s]  I then alter my diet with the goal of improving the blood biomarkers.
[165.20s]  And then after each blood test, I recalculate these correlations and then starting the process
[170.04s]  over increasing certain foods, decreasing certain foods based on how the correlations look.
[174.60s]  All right.
[175.60s]  So with these data in mind, which foods are significantly correlated with lower HSCRP?
[180.70s]  Now in my data, that happens to be turmeric.
[182.92s]  But as a quick again, side step, note that although I've weighed all of my foods since 2015,
[188.20s]  I only started tracking HSCRP in 2018.
[191.32s]  So I have 27 blood tests over that five plus year span for HSCRP versus food intake.
[198.46s]  So the strongest correlation is with turmeric and that's what we can see here.
[202.46s]  More specifically, we can see that a relatively higher intake of turmeric, average daily turmeric
[207.48s]  intake is significantly correlated with lower HSCRP.
[211.50s]  Now in terms of how I get that turmeric into my diet, I use ground powder.
[216.58s]  And that's in contrast with the whole food, more close to the whole food, which is the
[221.74s]  turmeric root.
[222.74s]  For some reason, eating the root tastes like soap to me and ruins anything that it's in.
[226.70s]  Whereas using the powder, I add that to cooked meals and it doesn't ruin the food.
[230.06s]  It actually helps with taste and texture.
[232.74s]  All right.
[233.74s]  So this is just one example.
[235.02s]  And arguably this is the strongest correlation for foods with lower HSCRP in my data.
[239.60s]  What about other foods?
[240.86s]  Are they significantly correlated with HSCRP?
[242.74s]  And that's what we can see here.
[244.74s]  This is a, the list for foods that are nominally significant.
[247.98s]  That's a P value less than 0.05 that are significantly correlated with lower HSCRP.
[253.50s]  And for those that are going to say, I haven't calculated a false discovery rate.
[257.54s]  This is true.
[258.18s]  I don't want to exclude any data because I don't know if any of these foods are actually causing
[263.34s]  lower HSCRP.
[264.30s]  So I try to follow as much of the data as possible.
[266.58s]  And by including a false discovery rate, I may be excluding data, thereby limiting my ability
[271.86s]  to potentially lower HSCRP.
[274.72s]  So when considering these associations with, or sorry, correlations with lower HSCRP, I
[280.68s]  keep my intake of them relatively high.
[282.98s]  And for those who want the exact amounts, I'll put the link to the video for my diet composition
[286.82s]  in terms of the exact amounts for these foods in the right corner.
[290.54s]  Now, conversely, in terms of foods that are correlated with lower CRP, there are also foods
[294.98s]  in my data that are significantly correlated with higher CRP as shown here.
[299.24s]  So with that in mind, the goal here is to minimize intake.
[302.10s]  So with this approach in mind, try to increase foods or keep relatively high foods that are
[307.68s]  significantly correlated with lower CRP and minimize foods that are significantly correlated
[311.96s]  with higher CRP in support of that approach.
[314.10s]  For the last 10 blood tests, my CRP levels had been less than the detection limit, Quest's
[319.90s]  detection limit, which is 0.3 milligrams per liter.
[322.84s]  So that would suggest that I'm on the right track for using this approach.
[327.10s]  Now, food intake may not be the only thing that's potentially impacting if correlation equals
[331.34s]  causation HSCRP in my data.
[333.88s]  So which other factors may be impacting HSCRP?
[338.40s]  And in my case, a higher daily heart rate, not the resting heart rate, but the higher heart
[343.22s]  rate for the full day, higher average daily heart rate is significantly correlated with HSCRP
[348.34s]  in my data.
[349.34s]  We can see here.
[350.34s]  So I only had the idea to start tracking the average daily heart rate, even though I've
[354.34s]  worn a fitness tracker as shown there since 2018.
[356.96s]  I only had that idea in 2020.
[359.02s]  So this is three plus years of data.
[360.72s]  And this is average daily heart rate data for 19 blood tests, 19 HSCRP blood tests.
[367.12s]  And there we can see a significant positive correlation.
[370.58s]  In other words, when there's more activity, more physical activity and or stress, because
[375.04s]  stress, including emotional or work stress can impact the daily heart rate too.
[381.10s]  When there's more of that in between blood tests, that's significantly correlated with a
[384.54s]  higher HSCRP.
[386.58s]  Conversely, when there's relatively lower levels of activity and or stress in between blood
[391.42s]  tests, the next blood test is more likely to have a lower HSCRP, at least based on this
[397.08s]  correlation.
[398.08s]  So when considering these data, it suggests that for me to minimize HSCRP, that suggests
[403.80s]  an optimal training activity and or stress that, you know, again, because stress can impact
[409.82s]  the daily heart rate of 55 to 57 beats per minute as the full day average daily heart rate.
[417.12s]  To put that into perspective, my average resting heart rate, RHR, and that's for the month of May
[421.42s]  in 2023 was 42.6 beats per minute, which suggests that going 12 to 14 beats per minute above my
[429.02s]  daily heart rate may be optimal for keeping HSCRP low.
[433.54s]  And I don't know if it's turmeric.
[434.66s]  I don't know if it's by minimizing activity while still trying to maximize fitness, but that's
[440.40s]  the story for HSCRP.
[442.54s]  But it also raises another question.
[444.74s]  Is the amount of physical activity that optimizes fitness different from the amount that may optimize
[449.36s]  longevity?
[450.36s]  I can definitely train more.
[451.36s]  And when considering that that's associated or that's significantly correlated with higher
[454.86s]  HSCRP, that may not be good for systemic health.
[458.36s]  Conversely, if I undertrain, that may not be good for fitness while potentially being good
[462.70s]  for HSCRP.
[464.00s]  So what's that dose that can optimize physical fitness, but then also maximize blood biomarkers
[470.92s]  and potentially longevity.
[473.02s]  More on that in a future video.
[474.02s]  All right.
[475.02s]  That's all for now.
