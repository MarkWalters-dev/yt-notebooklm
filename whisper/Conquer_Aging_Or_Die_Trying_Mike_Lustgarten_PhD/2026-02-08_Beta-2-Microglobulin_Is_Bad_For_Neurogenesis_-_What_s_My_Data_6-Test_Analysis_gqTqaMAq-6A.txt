[0.00s]  Grimmage is the best epigenetic clock for evaluating risk of death.
[4.64s]  And if you missed that video, I'll link to it in the right corner.
[7.82s]  But for now, which biomarkers are included in Grimmage?
[11.12s]  That's what we'll see here.
[12.74s]  So first, it includes age, gender, and an epigenetic approximation of smoking, DNA and pack years.
[18.90s]  And then, Grimmage version 1, which is shown here,
[21.96s]  Grimmage version 2 actually includes a couple of additional biomarkers,
[24.86s]  or epigenetic approximations of additional biomarkers,
[28.04s]  including HSCRP and HbA1c.
[31.08s]  But for now, I'm only focused on Grimmage version 1.
[34.36s]  It includes 7 protein biomarkers that may be obscure to many.
[38.56s]  Actually, it's an epigenetic approximation of those 7 biomarkers.
[42.08s]  So the first may not be obscure to many who are frequent viewers of the channel.
[46.26s]  And for that, thank you.
[47.38s]  It's an epigenetic approximation of Cystatin C,
[50.18s]  which is a biomarker of kidney function.
[51.86s]  But as we'll see in a future video,
[53.48s]  it's also associated with a biomarker of neurodegeneration.
[56.42s]  Then also, we've got leptin, which may seem familiar to many,
[60.36s]  but then others that are very obscure.
[62.54s]  TMP1, PAI1, GDF15, ADM,
[66.70s]  and the biomarker that I'm going to focus on in this video, B2M.
[70.70s]  B2M stands for beta-2 microglobulin,
[73.46s]  which then raises the question of, besides contributing to Grimmage,
[76.82s]  why is B2M important?
[78.48s]  The beginning of that story will be illustrated by this paper shown here,
[81.90s]  where B2M was identified as a systemic pro-aging factor
[86.18s]  that impairs cognitive function and neurogenesis.
[89.26s]  That then raises the question of what's optimal or what may be optimal for B2M.
[93.60s]  I won't show those data in this video,
[95.44s]  but it increases during aging,
[97.06s]  and higher levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.
[101.02s]  In terms of what's optimal,
[102.58s]  I have a new Patreon tier dedicated specifically to what's optimal for biomarkers,
[106.70s]  which now includes B2M, which we can classify not just as a kidney function biomarker,
[111.80s]  but also we can identify it as an immune-related biomarker,
[115.30s]  and, as we'll see in a minute, it's related to neurogenesis.
[119.28s]  Besides B2M, this tier currently includes 35 other biomarkers,
[123.32s]  almost two and a half hours of video content,
[125.62s]  57 published references,
[127.44s]  and note that these aren't the reference ranges which you can get from any LLM these days.
[131.34s]  This is my interpretation of what may be optimal
[133.52s]  based on how each of these biomarkers changes during aging,
[136.02s]  and or associations with all-cause mortality risk in the largest studies that exist.
[141.14s]  So if you're interested in that, check it out.
[143.28s]  In terms of the data from this paper,
[145.08s]  let's focus on B2M's impact on neurogenesis.
[148.68s]  First, starting off with the data here.
[151.10s]  On the y-axis, we've got double-quartin number of cells slash DG.
[155.38s]  So this is the number of double-quartin expressing cells,
[158.78s]  which is a neurogenesis biomarker, as I'll show in a minute,
[162.02s]  in the dentate gyrus, which is a portion of the brain.
[164.66s]  And in terms of double-quartin being identified as a neurogenesis biomarker,
[169.12s]  we'll see that story here.
[171.56s]  So neurogenesis proceeds along a spectrum,
[174.26s]  from quiescent neural stem cells on the left to mature neurons on the right.
[179.16s]  And we can see that there's a cell type as identified there
[181.86s]  that expresses double-quartin, or DCX positive cells.
[185.66s]  So double-quartin is well known as a biomarker of neurogenesis.
[189.70s]  So back to the data on the right, where they compared double-quartin expressing cells
[194.22s]  in mice that were treated with B2M for 12 days.
[198.16s]  And what we can see is that the neurogenesis biomarker, double-quartin,
[202.16s]  declined by about 20% in just 12 days after exposure,
[205.98s]  after mice were exposed to B2M.
[208.78s]  So relatively high levels of B2M impair neurogenesis.
[212.56s]  And I should also mention that that's important
[214.44s]  because neurogenesis declines during aging.
[216.56s]  So when considering that B2M increases during aging,
[219.28s]  are they causally linked?
[221.04s]  I'm not sure about the data in people,
[223.10s]  but this is an association that is not potentially good news.
[226.36s]  But this is just one part of the story.
[228.46s]  What happens if we remove B2M?
[230.86s]  So if adding it is bad for neurogenesis,
[232.94s]  if we remove B2M, we'd expect that to be good for neurogenesis.
[236.50s]  And that's what they tested in this study.
[238.42s]  Again, on the y-axis, we've got double-quartin expressing cells,
[241.44s]  so this neurogenesis biomarker.
[243.36s]  And now we've got B2M minus minus mice.
[245.98s]  So these are B2M knockout mice.
[248.44s]  In other words, they knocked out the B2M protein
[250.88s]  so that these mice didn't have B2M.
[254.94s]  And note that this is a longitudinal study
[256.90s]  as these mice were 18 months old.
[259.32s]  So this is an 18-month study
[261.34s]  of evaluating the effect of B2M on neurogenesis.
[265.68s]  When compared with the data in aged wild-type mice,
[268.60s]  which have normal levels of B2M,
[270.86s]  we can see that the mice that were genetically engineered
[272.88s]  to not have B2M had more than two times higher levels
[276.50s]  of this neurogenesis biomarker double-quartin.
[279.84s]  So collectively, these data implicate
[281.74s]  relatively high levels of B2M,
[283.72s]  especially as it occurs during the aging process,
[285.88s]  as potentially being bad for neurogenesis in people.
[288.82s]  But could that be true?
[290.58s]  As I mentioned, these data are in mice.
[292.32s]  What do the data look like in people?
[294.38s]  So that's what we can see here,
[296.00s]  where we're going to look at B2M levels
[297.86s]  in brains of people who were controls,
[300.44s]  who were not diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, AD,
[303.04s]  and in people who had Alzheimer's disease, AD.
[305.86s]  And note that this is a post-mortem study.
[307.96s]  So unfortunately, the people had died
[309.56s]  and they biopsied the brains afterwards
[311.18s]  and then quantified the amount of B2M
[313.24s]  that was in those brains.
[315.04s]  And what we can see is that people
[316.24s]  who were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease
[318.40s]  had two times higher levels of B2M in the brain,
[321.58s]  which again is potentially bad news.
[324.38s]  So with that in mind, what's my data?
[326.40s]  This isn't just a health and longevity news channel.
[329.00s]  As I've said this many times,
[330.30s]  this is also a health and longevity optimization channel.
[334.26s]  So what's my data?
[335.42s]  So I currently have six tests for B2M.
[337.52s]  As I mentioned, I just started measuring it in 2025.
[340.68s]  And as a quick aside,
[341.72s]  why I just started to measure this now?
[343.66s]  After realizing that I'd rather have the actual biomarkers
[346.76s]  rather than their epigenetic prediction
[348.52s]  as found in Grimmage,
[349.82s]  and knowing that B2M is one of the biomarkers,
[352.70s]  the actual biomarkers that Grimmage is based on,
[354.74s]  I started measuring B2M in 2025.
[357.22s]  I wish I'd measured it earlier
[358.42s]  because then I'd have more data
[359.84s]  and trying to bring it down
[361.40s]  or keep it as low as possible.
[363.12s]  So over those six tests in 2025,
[365.48s]  average B2M is 1.58 milligrams per liter,
[368.56s]  which then again raises a question of what's optimal.
[371.68s]  And without going to the Patreon tier,
[373.42s]  the what's optimal for biomarkers tier,
[375.02s]  again, lower is generally better.
[376.58s]  If you want the actual numbers
[377.82s]  and you want to see the data
[378.76s]  that I used to derive that story, check it out.
[381.72s]  Also, avoiding an age-related increase.
[384.76s]  And this story is currently incomplete
[386.32s]  as I only have one year of data
[387.88s]  so I can't evaluate if I'm resisting age-related change.
[391.48s]  But then it raises a question of
[392.94s]  what can I do to reduce B2M as I'd like to go lower?
[395.84s]  For me, my interpretation of the published literature
[398.12s]  is that 1.58 milligrams per liter for B2M,
[401.74s]  while although not terribly high,
[403.78s]  isn't as low as I'd prefer to be.
[406.60s]  So in terms of what I can do to potentially reduce it,
[409.00s]  I'm gonna look at correlations for diet with B2M.
[412.52s]  And for those who are unfamiliar,
[414.00s]  how I'm able to do that,
[415.54s]  since 2015, so for the past 10 plus years,
[418.74s]  I've weighed almost all of my food,
[420.94s]  more than 99% with a food scale.
[423.38s]  I then enter those data into Chronometer,
[425.42s]  a diet tracking app.
[426.36s]  And quick shout out, if you wanna use Chronometer,
[428.36s]  there's a discount link in the video's description.
[430.48s]  I then pull the Chronometer data into a spreadsheet.
[433.48s]  So the macros and micros and individual food amounts.
[435.66s]  So now each dietary period in between tests
[439.66s]  can be used for the latter test.
[442.34s]  In other words, if there's a 50-day period
[444.22s]  in between blood testing,
[445.56s]  I can take the average dietary intake for those 50 days,
[448.80s]  and that lines up with the latter blood test.
[451.26s]  So now every blood test has an average dietary intake.
[454.50s]  With enough blood tests,
[455.64s]  once I get to three blood tests,
[456.90s]  I can start looking at correlations.
[458.82s]  Now sure, there's gonna be a lot of noise in the data
[461.16s]  after three blood tests,
[462.64s]  but as many of you know and have seen on this channel,
[464.66s]  I have now 60-plus blood tests
[466.22s]  for most clinical chemistry-related biomarkers,
[469.06s]  kidney, liver, immune, et cetera.
[470.58s]  So I can look at correlations
[471.94s]  that can help drive me towards what's an optimal diet
[474.70s]  and even supplements.
[476.24s]  So using that approach,
[477.46s]  let's take a look at correlations for B2M
[479.72s]  over these six tests with diet
[481.34s]  to see what I could potentially do
[482.74s]  to bring it towards the lower end of my range.
[486.12s]  So this is the top portion of that table,
[488.52s]  and note that correlations for diet with biomarkers
[490.70s]  for all biomarkers, not just B2M,
[492.46s]  with 30 other clinical chemistry biomarkers.
[495.38s]  And then I also look at correlations
[496.74s]  for diet with metabolomic data.
[498.48s]  So I have another 600-plus metabolites
[500.76s]  that are correlated with diet.
[502.66s]  So if you're interested in that,
[503.72s]  check us out on the correlations tier on Patreon.
[506.14s]  So for this table,
[507.14s]  we can see that the lowercase r
[509.02s]  is the correlation coefficient.
[510.78s]  And then on the right,
[511.44s]  we've got the p-value
[512.28s]  as a measure of statistical significance.
[514.48s]  And here I've used just less than 0.05
[517.22s]  as the standard nominal threshold
[519.58s]  for statistical significance.
[521.48s]  I'm not using a false discovery rate,
[523.50s]  and if people are interested in why that's the case,
[525.84s]  just leave a comment,
[526.58s]  and I'd be happy to describe my process for that
[528.72s]  in the comments under the video's description.
[532.26s]  So in terms of the correlations,
[533.60s]  we can see that there are four
[534.74s]  that meet that significance threshold.
[537.06s]  Cacao beans, and these are raw,
[538.66s]  organic cacao beans, not nibs,
[540.38s]  which have a positive correlation,
[542.04s]  which I've labeled as red.
[543.58s]  That positive correlation suggests
[545.70s]  that when cacao intake is towards
[548.00s]  the higher end of my range,
[549.34s]  that's significantly correlated
[550.52s]  with higher levels of B2M.
[552.80s]  Note that I said correlation.
[554.32s]  This is not causation.
[555.54s]  I can't see anything about causation.
[557.42s]  I can get close to causation
[558.74s]  by either increasing or decreasing
[561.14s]  a given amount of food or nutrient
[563.16s]  based on these correlations.
[564.48s]  But again, these are correlations.
[565.84s]  I'm not presuming causation.
[568.16s]  On the other hand, inverse correlations,
[570.74s]  which suggest that higher levels of the food
[572.72s]  may be related to lower levels of B2M
[576.26s]  include almonds, lemon, and potatoes.
[579.36s]  So what do I do with this information?
[581.28s]  Well, I try to follow the correlations.
[583.40s]  If higher cacao is related
[584.86s]  to higher levels of B2M,
[586.32s]  if I reduce it, that should lower.
[588.22s]  Again, if correlation equals causation,
[590.38s]  the only way I can find out
[591.64s]  is by doing the experiment.
[593.70s]  So to test that, for the next test,
[595.36s]  I've removed cacao beans.
[597.38s]  Additionally, what about almonds?
[599.54s]  So the correlations only tell us
[601.54s]  whether they're increasing or decreasing,
[603.26s]  but they don't tell us about amount of food
[605.24s]  to follow a given correlation.
[607.20s]  So let's illustrate what the plot
[609.42s]  for B2M looks like versus almonds,
[611.44s]  which is what we'll see here.
[612.88s]  With B2M on the y-axis,
[614.58s]  plotted against average daily almond intake
[616.84s]  that corresponds to each one of these blood tests.
[619.68s]  First, we can see that inverse correlation.
[622.24s]  And then based on extrapolation of the plot,
[624.14s]  if I want to bring B2M levels lower,
[626.54s]  I should aim for somewhere
[627.74s]  in the 20 to 25 gram of almond range,
[630.90s]  at least at a minimum per day.
[633.92s]  So average almond intake,
[635.30s]  again, because I track diet,
[636.68s]  I know exactly how much I'm eating for every day.
[639.98s]  Average almond intake since test number eight,
[642.26s]  blood test number eight in 2025,
[644.04s]  is currently 19 grams per day.
[646.54s]  And you could say, why not go higher?
[648.34s]  Why not just jack it up to 25, 30, whatever,
[651.02s]  50 grams of almonds per day?
[652.72s]  Well, unfortunately in my data,
[654.54s]  almond, not just almonds,
[656.02s]  but overall monounsaturated fat containing foods
[658.84s]  are significantly correlated with higher levels of glucose,
[662.22s]  which is moving in the wrong direction.
[663.74s]  And you could say, how does that make any sense?
[665.70s]  Move for our thought to be heart healthy,
[667.70s]  why would that be positively correlated with glucose?
[670.00s]  I have no idea,
[670.86s]  but that's what the data shows in my case.
[673.70s]  Additionally, almonds are a rich source of oxalate
[676.76s]  and potentially more importantly,
[679.00s]  their oxalate to calcium ratio,
[681.18s]  they have more oxalate than they do calcium,
[683.96s]  which suggests that oxalate from almonds
[685.68s]  will be absorbed and not excreted
[687.60s]  as oxalate binds to calcium one to one.
[690.34s]  So those are two main reasons why I haven't gone higher
[692.90s]  as I have to temper,
[694.40s]  I have to modulate the amount of almonds
[695.92s]  that I'm consuming to keep oxalate levels relatively low
[698.94s]  and to keep my MUFA levels
[701.00s]  from going towards their highest level,
[702.92s]  which again, in my case,
[704.04s]  is significantly correlated
[705.10s]  with higher levels of glucose.
[707.20s]  So based on extrapolation
[708.60s]  of the average of 19 grams per day,
[710.62s]  currently since the last test,
[712.62s]  we'd expect that I should see B2M levels
[714.64s]  somewhere around 1.5 milligrams per liter,
[717.26s]  which still isn't as low as I'd like to get it to,
[720.48s]  but on the other hand,
[721.94s]  it may not be as high as my two highest tests,
[725.64s]  which you can see were greater
[726.68s]  than 1.6 milligrams per liter.
[729.18s]  But remember, this is just part of the story.
[731.34s]  I've also removed cacopiants.
[733.36s]  So if both of these foods are somehow involved
[735.52s]  in mechanisms that impact B2M,
[737.56s]  the combination of following these two correlations
[739.88s]  may allow for movement towards lower,
[742.50s]  you know, towards one or lower than 1.5.
[746.26s]  But there may be a sneaky food on this list
[748.74s]  that the correlations don't yet indicate
[750.90s]  how strong of an impact it may have on B2M,
[754.44s]  and that's strawberries.
[755.56s]  You can see that strawberries have a significant
[757.54s]  or close to significant,
[758.88s]  that P value is 0.06,
[760.52s]  just outside of that threshold
[761.82s]  of P value less than 0.05.
[764.66s]  So I've been eating a lot of strawberries,
[766.84s]  more than usual.
[767.80s]  In fact, since the last test,
[770.44s]  close to three pounds per day,
[771.90s]  which is up from around two pounds per day.
[774.12s]  Now, if strawberries are somehow involved
[776.18s]  in mechanisms that impact B2M,
[778.14s]  even if I follow the cacao bean and almond correlations,
[781.90s]  if those foods aren't actually involved
[783.82s]  in relatively high levels or low levels of B2M,
[786.32s]  and it's strawberries that are driving that,
[788.30s]  I may actually see higher levels of B2M
[790.26s]  for the next test.
[791.12s]  Nonetheless, this is data collection.
[793.66s]  That story is informative
[795.30s]  because the correlations for cacao and almonds
[797.76s]  will weaken.
[798.60s]  The correlation for strawberries will strengthen.
[801.42s]  And then with that in mind,
[803.00s]  that'll be more motivation
[804.16s]  to cut down on my strawberry intake.
[806.14s]  If B2M is a part of that story
[808.44s]  where high strawberry intake
[809.74s]  may be driving B2M higher,
[811.48s]  I'm going to have no choice
[812.44s]  but to cut down on strawberry intake,
[813.80s]  for sure, not from three pounds per day,
[816.40s]  to something more moderate,
[818.54s]  two pounds per day,
[819.22s]  or even a little lower.
[821.00s]  It's tough for me
[821.66s]  because I love strawberries
[822.68s]  and they're satiating.
[823.92s]  And part of being on a calorie-restricted diet
[825.46s]  is eating a variety of foods
[827.46s]  that help keep me satiated,
[828.78s]  and strawberries are a key component of that.
[830.76s]  So will it work?
[831.72s]  Will B2M move lower
[832.90s]  for test number one in 2026?
[835.66s]  That test is scheduled for January 30th,
[837.72s]  and if you're watching this on YouTube,
[839.00s]  it may have been a month
[840.04s]  where I've actually done this blood test.

[866.92s]  which is pretty close to me
[868.20s]  and it's convenient.
[869.22s]  And that may not be convenient
[870.48s]  for others who are into blood testing like me.
[873.20s]  So I recently reached out
[874.40s]  to get another lab testing affiliate link,
[876.70s]  this time from Life Extension,
[878.12s]  which uses LabCorp.
[879.06s]  So if you have a Quest Lab
[880.58s]  or a LabCorp in your area
[882.16s]  and you're into blood testing like me
[884.06s]  and you'd like to help support the channel,
[885.64s]  if you use the affiliate links
[886.96s]  in the video description,
[887.96s]  you would help out tremendously.
[889.58s]  At-home metabolomics,
[890.98s]  any testing with Genfinity,
[892.88s]  epigenetic testing with True Diagnostic.
[894.56s]  These are other affiliate links
[895.68s]  that are in the video description.
[897.10s]  At-home blood testing with Cy Fox Health,
[898.68s]  which includes Grim Age.
[899.60s]  But again, I'd prefer to measure
[900.88s]  the actual biomarkers
[902.36s]  relative to the epigenetics.
[903.88s]  Maybe you disagree
[904.62s]  and you want the epigenetic test
[905.92s]  as Grim Age is a very strong test,
[907.94s]  consistently associated
[909.12s]  with risk of death for all causes
[910.60s]  in a multitude of studies.
[912.28s]  That too is in the video description,
[913.70s]  affiliate link.
[914.84s]  Oral microbiome composition,
[916.52s]  dietracking with chronometer,
[917.90s]  green tea,
[918.46s]  which I drink every day,
[919.80s]  the clearly filtered water filter,
[921.12s]  which I'm using every day too.
[922.68s]  Or if you'd like to support the channel,
[924.08s]  you can do that with the website,
[925.20s]  buy me a coffee.
[926.34s]  We've also got merch,
[927.58s]  including Data is my North Star,
[929.02s]  which I've got on here.
[930.56s]  Figuring Stuff Out is my drug,
[931.88s]  and the Conquer Aging or Dietracking logo.
[934.46s]  Link in the video's description.
[935.56s]  Thanks for watching.
[937.36s]  Hope that you enjoyed the video.
[938.84s]  Have a great day.
