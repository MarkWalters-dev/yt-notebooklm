Relatively higher triglycerides are associated with an increased coronary heart disease mortality risk. And that's what we can see here in this study of about four point five million people. On the y axis, we've got the hazard ratio for CHD mortality. In other words, risk of death from heart disease plotted against triglycerides or T A G on the x axis. And when looking at the fully adjusted model, that's the data in green and the shaded green region, we can see that above a triglyceride level of about 75 milligrams per deciliter, that CHD mortality risk significantly increases as its shaded green shaded green region is completely above that hazard ratio of one. So these data would suggest that triglycerides are bad for health, but all triglycerides are not the same for the potential impacts on health and even longevity. And that's because individual triglycerides are associated with an increased odds of living to 85 years. And that's what we'll see here. This is a study that looked at a plot of longevity versus all cause mortality in about twelve thousand people. On the waxes, we've got the log of the odds ratio o r for longevity. In other words, odds of living to 85 years plotted against the log of the hazard ratio for all cause mortality. In other words, risk of death for all causes on the x axis. And where we wanna be on this plot is the upper left quadrant. And that's where there's the highest odds for reaching 85 years and the lowest risk for death from all causes, all cause mortality risk. So there, we can see that there are three, at least three triglyceride species that pop up in that upper left quadrant. C fifty six eight. In other words, 56 carbons, eight double bonds, triglyceride, t a g. 58 carbons 11 double bonds, and 58 carbons seven double bonds as shown there. And there are a few other red dots that are not shown which are shown here. So there are four other triglyceride species. And then we can see how they relate to that odds of reaching 85 in this table. So those five triglyceride species. And that's what's shown on the left, odds of reaching 85 in the middle. Now here, we can see that the odds ratio is greater than one in each case. For example, for the c fifty four nine t a g, it's 1.11. But more importantly is the data in parentheses. That's the 95% confidence interval. And you can see that that those values are completely above one which suggests a significant association. And when looking at the p value and F D R for each of these five longevity associated triglycerides, we can see that their their, p value and F D R is less than 0.05. So these are significantly associated with an increased odds of reaching 85 years. So with that in mind, the goal is to keep these triglycerides relatively high. And the good news is that these triglycerides can be tracked and then potentially optimized. And the way I've been doing that is I've used, I'm using, IOLO's at home metabolomics kit which includes 241 different triglyceride species including 29 longevity associate associated triglycerides that correspond to the five that are on this table. In addition, this kit also has data for 385 and more metabolites which I've highlighted in many videos on this channel. And if you're interested in using it yourself, discount link in the video's description. Alright. So what's my data? So all of that data for seven tests is shown here. On the right, we've got those five longevity associated triglycerides, and then note that on the left, there are a myriad of ways to form these triglycerides. In the first case, c fifty four nine, there's only one, metabolite in IOLO's kit that corresponds. So that's relatively easy. But when going to fifty six six, you can see that there are a variety of different triglyceride combinations that form that fifty six six triglyceride species. For example, c twenty two four in one case, c 24 in another case, and then you've got two other groups of fatty acids, thirty four two and thirty six two. So there are many different triglyceride combinations that can form a given triglyceride species. In this case, fifty six six. And we can see why that's the case by taking a quick look at triglyceride biochemistry as shown here. So on the left, triglyceride has a glycerol backbone and and then there are three fatty acids that are connected, esterified to glycerol. In this case, each of the fatty acids are the same, and they include the c twelve one double bond fatty acid. So to get the sum, we get a c thirty six three triglyceride as shown there. So each of these each of these positions in the triglyceride can have different fatty acids thereby leading to different combinations and, with these combinations forming specific triglyceride species. Alright. So how am I tracking these data with the goal of keeping them relatively high? Well, I tested five times in 2023 and then for each test, I'm taking the sum of these 29 longevity associated triglycerides that correspond to these five triglyceride species. So for the first test, for example, we can see that that sum was 17.5 micro molar. Now, that's relatively low and actually that's the lowest value that I had for their sum for any of the five tests in 2023. In contrast, for test number three, I had 79 micro molar which is my best to date for these 29 triglyceride, species. So the goal is to keep these relatively high. Now, another way that I'm looking at it is by looking at year to year changes with the goal of avoiding any age related decrease or even a diet induced change that can lead to a decrease in these specific triglycerides. So for 2022, when looking at the sum for those five different tests, my average value for these 29 triglyceride species is 42 micro molar. Now, for 2024, I currently have data for two tests. I just sent, data on Monday corresponding to blood test number three in 2024 for analysis to IOLO, so that'll be test number three. So after the first two tests though, the average value for these 29 triglycerides is currently 47 micromolars. So 2024 is off to a really good relatively good start and avoiding any age related decline and keeping these triglycerides, these specific triglycerides relatively high. So then the question is, how can I keep these triglycerides relatively high? And for that, I calculate correlations with diet and I won't go into it in this video, but they are currently on Patreon.
