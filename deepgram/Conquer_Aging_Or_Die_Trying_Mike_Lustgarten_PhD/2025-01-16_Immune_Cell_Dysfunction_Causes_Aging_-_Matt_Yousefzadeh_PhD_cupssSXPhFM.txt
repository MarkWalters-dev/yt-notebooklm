This was showing that mitochondrial dysfunction just in t cells alone can drive a really strong premature aging phenotype in solid organs. And kind of based upon both our data, what is likely happening is that, you know, we have a normal immune cell. Either you can take away DNA repair or remove a mitochondrial maintenance protein or just with age, you develop this endogenous damage or stress, and you get a senescence immune cell. And eventually that senescent immune cell takes on that secretory phenotype and can cause secondary senescence, whether it's other immune cells or epithelial cells or other cell types, you know, it's probably a mixture of all of that. And so what I say is that senescent immune cell is helping to build up a lot more immune cells, sort of building up a lot of trash. Well, at the same time, the immune cell is losing its capability of doing its job of removing the trash. And ultimately, it's sort of a two phase mechanism that's related to, you know, that's driving this profound interorgan communication of aging and driving systemic age.
