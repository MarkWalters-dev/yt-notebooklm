Alright. So we jump in. We'll start off, I guess. Do you wanna start off with immune? Neutrophil. Absolutely. Yeah. Alright. So just as a a a background. So, you know, white blood cells are in PhenoAge, but, white blood cells aren't a a homogeneous group. Right? So they've got neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, eosinophils. So I don't pay much attention to the basophils and eosinophils because they're very, very small, you know, numbers. The almost 95% or more are the neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. So I focus on that. But then there too, there's some disparity because the neutrophils and monocytes increase during aging and lymphocytes decrease during aging. So if we're only focused on, and I know you're not, but there might be people out there who look at pheno age or white blood cells, and they think, oh, my white blood cells are in range. They could be within range for fifty years and lymphocytes increasing. No. Sorry. Neutrophils increasing, lymphocytes decreasing, and white blood cell cells stays stable, but the data is going in the wrong direction. That's a pro inflammatory phenotype. So I find the most value in looking at the, you know, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. Alright. So your data your data is pretty flat. So the trend line gets you just above what is that? Like, two you've got 2,000, the Lustgarten optimal range. 2,000 to 3,000 for neutrophils, looks like, in green? Yes. Yes. I do. Cool. So, yeah, aiming for the lower end of the range, should be optimal. That's based on all cause mortality risk. The question of how low knowing that they increase during aging, somewhat debatable. I mean, 16 hundred, 17, 1,800, is that, you know, really less optimal compared to 2100? So there is an increase in all cause mortality risk less than two thousand, but, I'm guessing there probably is reverse causation there where people who have very low neutrophil levels may also have inflammation. So for those for those tests where you've got less than two thousand, I'd look to see, you know, was at least HS CRP, low. Right? So point three milligrams per liter or somewhere in that ballpark. If it was like one, one point two with no low low neutrophils, it would suggest to me that there may be a problem in making neutrophils. And then whatever's there would be, you know, increasing inflammation. Remind me to go back to, HSCRP after we do with this. We'll take a look at that. Sure. It's on today's list, Dave. It's on today's list. Okay. Okay. Oh, good. You've got a list. Alright. I love it. I have it all mapped out. Alright. So neutrophils neutrophils look good, especially because that trend line is right at the bottom of the of the reference or not the the optimal range. And then, yeah, lymphocytes decline during aging. And that's what we see here too. Right? So, so, yeah, that your data the trend line, I mean, granted, it's just a few data points. But if you look at, say, 2021, we had more tests starting with more tests. I mean, even there, you're starting from about 1,300 and then declining to around now 1,100. So that's a big one. We wanna get those closer to 2,000 if we can. That that's what's, most likely found in youth based on population based averages, and it's associated with lowest risk of death for all causes. So Well, so I'm I'm way below two thousand then. For now. Yeah. But that you have variability in that data. So for example, you know, just even last year, you had close to 1,600, fifteen hundred. So it's just a matter of what's the recipe where you avoid, like, nine hundred, which you you saw last year. You saw two years ago nine hundred. You know, how can you avoid the lows and have more of these highs? Even if you just go from, like, 1,300 to 1,600, flatten out that curve, you know, that's that would be the first start in trying to figure out what's you know, what to do to, you know, resist the h related decline. Like, monocytes? It's definitely malleable, I should say, too, the lymphocytes. So mine recently have declined too, but I think that's dietary change. So I'm doing a bunch of stuff, and mine have been as low as twelve fifty seven. I've never had them lower over the past past ten years, so we'll see if I can reverse it to get it back to where, you know, it should be. Yeah. I'm gonna be curious to see what what levers I can push to make those move. Yeah. Alright. So monocytes yeah. So monocytes increase during aging so that you've resisted that is good news. And the values are pretty good too, you know, around, it's like point I mean, look at how we have got two, like, straight lines and I kinda ping pong between. Yeah. It yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what that's about. That's kind of interesting. It could be it could be that, so sometimes the lab report will say, like, monocytes 8%, and then it'll say, point three three hundred, you know, cells per microliter. Whereas if you took the total white blood cells and then multiplied it by that 8%, you get the actual number versus the rounded number. So it could be that you just wrote down. So it might be, you know, point three. You wrote down point threes instead of multiplying white blood cells by the percentage of monocytes. I mean, I usually just I have I have it scripted where this just pulls it right off of the, PDF, the library. Yeah. So it's like either because it looks like it's either point two or point three. So they they round it down instead of giving the actual number. But you can see anyway, it's in the ballpark. Right? But, you know, it's not it's not gonna change your data from, you know, point two to point three range to point four to point six range. You know what I mean? It's it's a rounding issue in your case. So, yeah, increases during aging, so you're you should be good here too. And then platelets too. Platelets are contribute to immune defense. So let's see that. I think these are alphabetized. So platelets no. No. They're not alphabetized. Alright. So maybe I rolled past platelets. That'll be the next thing I work on is alphabetizing these so I can find them easier. Yeah. It'll just be an easy easy sort of the the data before I chart them. Oh, wait. Lipacide percentage? But before we go to Sure. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. So that too yeah. That don't definitely declines during aging, higher being potentially better. And I say potentially because as far as I know, there are no studies all cause mortality risk. All we have is the aging data. So this kinda ties in with your lymphocyte levels, declining. Right? So, basically, total white blood cells are stable. Lymphocytes are declining, so the percentage is declining. So, At least within this, I'm kinda within my optimal range mainly. Yeah. But then then you know? So even there too, like, you know, if you think about centenarians, if if if, you know so if the glucose reference range is 80 to 94 and you've got a centenarian who's 93, you could say or I don't know if that's the best example. Maybe using, like, I don't know, TNF alpha or something. If the ref if the in inflammation if the inflammatory marker is less than three and they're at 2.8. Right? So how much of aging is if they had kept their were able to keep their TNF alpha, like, point three and avoid it getting the 2.8? Is that just the aged phenotype where now, you know, you're in range, but it's been increasing over time. You know? Yeah. Yeah. It's a it's a hard one. We you know, we've gotta resist age related change and have it in the optimal range. Agreed. There's is that neutrophils in case you wanted to see that one? Yeah. I that one the neutrophil percentage, I'm not so it's it's the lymphocyte percentage I'm most interested, but platelets. K. Platelets. There we go. There we go. Alright. Flat is good. Nice. They decline during aging. Two hundred and three hundred close to optimal based on all cause mortality risk. Lower than that, increased risk, higher than that, increased risk. So then it raised the question, where should you be two hundred and three three hundred? Should it be closer to 200? Should it be closer to 300? When When considering it declines during aging, it would suggest higher maybe better in that context. But in my data, when I do biomarker versus biomarker analysis, platelets versus the other big ones, closer to 200 may be better. In your case, those stable. So we're we're all good there. If they start to decline, that's another flag, you know, or or, you know, whack a mole we've gotta try to try to cut. I know that I clot quickly, so I rarely need bandages, especially if I do the, you know, the finger prick blood test. It just clots right away. So I like That's a nice thing about having high platelet counts. But Nice. I'm like a Tameritino movie where after the finger prick, I could, like, squirt that you know, squirt.
