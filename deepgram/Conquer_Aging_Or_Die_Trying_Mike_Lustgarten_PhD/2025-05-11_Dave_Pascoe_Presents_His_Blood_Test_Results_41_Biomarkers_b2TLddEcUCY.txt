Hey, everyone. Today's guest is Dave Pascoe for the second time on the channel. Now you've seen Dave all over the interwebs, but today's gonna be be completely different. Today, we're gonna take a deep dive into Dave's, blood test data, and we're gonna start off with biological age and then go through, markers of organ systems. So kidney, liver, immune, and identify strengths, weaknesses, and all of the data on the map. So with that, welcome. And, I guess let's start with PhenoAge. Thank you, Mike. It's great to be back again. By the way, I I like to call this particular episode the good, the bad, and the ugly. Nice. So you see, like, in 2020, I seem to be doing a whole lot better than I I did in, like, 2021. I I show the the year, so this would be the average trend. That would be the actual FeNO age. That's my, you know, 58 there was would be my chrono age at the beginning of that year. And so you can see I am, I am increasing as the years go by, but now, like, in 2024, 2025, I'm starting my downhill slide. So, hopefully, I can keep that trend going. Pretty pretty stable, though. I mean, starting in, I think yeah. So 2021, it it's pretty it's about ten years younger, all the way across. Like so pheno age increases by point nine years for every year of chronological age. So starting in 2021, you should be you know, so that's four plus years later or three and a half years later. So that should be three years older. So your average pheno age for 2025 should be fifty one and a half fifty two. Whereas it's still, you can see it's in the ballpark, 48 0.65. So you've you've resisted that, year year to year pheno age increase, even if all biomarkers stay the same. So that's good news. I mean, that's basically slowing, you know, the rate of aging over time. So far so good. I guess we'll we'll see how things go in the future. The other thing to point out is how many tests that you're this isn't one data point. So how many what is that in 2021? How many how many data points? How many times did you measure? Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, about yeah. Roughly 12. I usually do about one test per month. So there's usually about, you know, eleven, twelve data points each year. Nice. That, I mean, year to year change, having more data is better. So that that's great news. And then what, what was going on in 2024? It looks like in May through the end of the year. I mean, it's like one, two, three, four, five tests all going in the wrong direction. Yeah. That I would really have to go dig to figure out what was happening with that. I don't I don't know. Let's think. Oh, yeah. Actually, I do know what was happening with that. Okay. So, because I can think back to how my, actual true diagnostic data went. It was around August time frame that, Sierra Clark came out to my home and did all the recording. Right? And I put myself through a ton of stress because the house had just gotten remodeled. There was construction dust everywhere. I didn't know what the film crew was gonna pick up. So, I mean, I just did a deep dive inside, outside the house, you know, fixing everything, cleaning. I was really under a lot of stress. Then, like, October time frame, I got COVID. And so that's probably where a lot of this increased. And then we, you know, we came back down again after the new year, and I'm, like, dropping ever since. Nice. Except for this last one. So when it when it comes to testing, are you standardizing before a test? Like, for example, if you're testing on a Monday, when's the last when's your last workout? Have you standardized that test to test? No. I have not, and I do need to do that. I I typically will test, like, maybe on the fifth of the month. Well, actually, you can see here. Sometimes it's the seventh of the month. Sometimes it's the fifth, the third. So I always try to hit closest to the beginning of the month when I can. But no. I mean, now I am. I now I'm trying to standardize, like, at least, if it's gonna be a Monday, not working out at all on Sunday. Yeah. Trying to be more more thoughtful about the water that I drink beforehand, you know, so I'm not dehydrated. There's a lot of the times I was just rolling out of bed and just driving straight over and taking the test because I wanna be tested. But, yeah, now I wanna make sure that I've got at least some water in me that makes the blood flow better. But it also makes the tests more probably more accurate. So, have you standardized how much water, or it's just just some rather than none? Yeah. No. I I have not standardized on how much. It would be just one of my my standard mugs full of water, which is probably about two cups. What do you recommend? So I I do about 16 to 20 ounces, in in that range. Not more and not less. But it I don't think the amount matters. Just as long as you get some water in there, how much you would need is debatable. Like, because, you know, for me, I can urinate it out most of it in two hours. So I know that that's a decent amount. So if it was eight ounces, maybe I wouldn't urinate any of it out in two hours. So maybe that would be an, you know, insufficient amount. So it sounds like two cups is enough, 16 ounces in your case. So, the other factor though is the fasting window. So, you know, so what's recommend is generally overnight fast. But is is there is there an introduction of variability in the blood test data if you fast eight hours, twelve hours, sixteen hours? That's a great question. Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, and I'm not eating the same food every day either. So that's more even more variability. Yeah. So are there plans to, you know, note the fasting window? Or or or because if that so so if you know, imagine if some of your data is impacted by maybe one test you fasted for shorter versus longer duration, then it's harder to know what may move move the needle, right, when it may have just been the fasting window. I I I generally have a core diet that I stick to day before the test, even though, you know, for the forty to fifty day period before, there may be more variability in diet, but for definitely the day before the test, there I do have a core diet that I basically stick to so that it's not previous day diet that's messing up or impacting biomarkers, but I don't know. Just just an idea. Just No. That that's a brilliant idea. I never actually considered that. That's why I love what you do because what you do is I mean, of all the, influencers that claim they're doing science, you are the one that truly is doing science. The rest of us are just sort of, you know, hackers, which so I've been sort of hacking around at this not, not maybe being as intentional as I could be. So I I think I'm gonna take your advice and do that moving forward. Cool. Trying to figure out some meal that I'm gonna make as my standard that I'll do before the test. Yeah. At least the core so that, you know yeah. Alright. So so let's can we deep can we do a deep dive into PhenoAge's components? So the biggest predictor of PhenoAge is RDW, so maybe starting there and seeing how that's changed over time. So let's go to what are we looking for? So we're looking for yeah. BloodHub. Right? Yep. Okay. Let's generate that. Okay. So And wait. Real quick. I think it's I think it's important for people to know that, like, there's this idea of cherry picking your best data and then saying that this is your rate of aging or this is your biological age or this is your marker of organ health and only doing it, like, once per year. But is that really this is Mike on the diatribe, right, on the soliloquy. But is that really representative of your true data? Like, how many how many tests would one need to get an accurate representation of year to year change for a biomarker for biomarkers of organ systems, for biological age, etcetera. Right? So, I mean, you've got more data than me in in some cases. So, you know, I this illustrates, you know, tracking as much as you can and then looking at your year to year change. You you can imagine if we did this like Brian Johnson does and pick our best value out of the past two years of each of these different, you know, each of these different markers and then present that all in one spreadsheet for people to say, look. Look how great I am. That just The sad thing the sad thing about that is, like and the thing is I'm still torn on Brian. Sometimes I listen to him and it's like, he's saying all the right things. And then I see the other side where people are just attacking him for things, and then he calls them bad actors, but he doesn't actually address the thing that he's being challenged on, which Because he can't. That's the problem. So then it's like, is it malicious intent, or is it outright ignorance? I I don't know which. Yeah. I I who knows? I mean, we can't guess what's going on in somebody else's mind, but it certainly doesn't look good. Yeah. And then it's like, if it is if the idea is to cherry pick one's best data, and then so many people are gonna follow that approach and think that that's how we should be slowing aging and and, you know, potentially slowing disease risk and max maximizing longevity. I mean, how many people are gonna be led astray? You know what I mean? So, That's that's why I really love that you showed your blood work the other day, and we're gonna show mine now just to show people that real blood work is messy. It's all over the place. Nothing is perfect. You know? So if if somebody presents a a front that, you know, everything they do is just perfect and right on on par, they're probably not being honest. Yeah. For sure. I've got weak spots. I've got, like, some eczema going on on my eyelid and my lip now. I'm still trying to figure out what's going on there. And for people who don't know, I've got the glasses on for the first time, and this is a new thing that I just, you know, initiated about a month ago. So alright. So RDW. Let's start off with, RDW as it's the biggest predictor of, phenOH. Here we go. Right here. Yeah. Can we zoom in just on that one and and Sure. And move the other ones or move that to a separate You know, I was going to create the drop down so that I could just generate one at a time, but I, unfortunately, I didn't get that implemented in time for our Oh, no worries. No worries. In here. So is that, how is that? Yeah. Does it look decent in here? Yeah. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. So luckily, my trend isn't, like, super steep, but I do I am trending as an increase, which is why the the heading is in red. So if I'm trending in the direction of aging, it's it shows in red. If I'm trending in the direction the opposite direction of aging, it's showing in the head the title in green. Alright. Wait. That's that's I'm a little bit confused, Dave. So because the red lines are parallel No. Oh, I'm sorry. I mean, the title the title is in red. That means I'm this black trend line is trending in the direction of aging, so I'm going in the wrong way, the wrong direction. That's a very mild trend. I mean, granted, looks pretty flat. You know? So the black line is your trend line. Okay. Yeah. It's it's And you can see I'm within the reference ranges here. The button the two red lines are the top and bottom of the reference range. But my optimal my optimal is, like, really, really tight. My optimal is down here, so this is really where I would like to be in this range. So wait. So that's that's a good point to illustrate. So how are you determining? So your optimal is different from mine. So how are you determining optimal for just RDW in this case? So I would have to go back to my reference table, which is gonna be like an eye chart for you guys. So let's see. RDW. This is alphabetized. A lot of my data, I cross referenced with yours, with other stuff that I've received, like, from other, you know, books and podcasts that I listened to. And, of course, you know, even using some chat GPT to to look into stuff. So RDW. Here's, the reference range for, LabCorp was 11.6 to 15.4. Yeah. I can I can zoom in on this if you can't see that? Yeah. That's a wide range. But your optimal range, your specific My optimal range. I set that between, like, 8.1 to 12.5. But why that specific? Do you know where where you or it's just like the accumulation of So let's see if I actually included that here. Yeah. Because I think it was a little bit different on the plot. Increases with aging. Definitely. Yep. Interesting. It should not be different in my plot, but let's see. So 8.1 to 12.5, and let's go back to the plot. That's what was throwing me off. I think the upper upper limit on your range can you zoom it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So your green the green upper limit on the green was, like, 12.7. It was, like, eight to 12.7 that yeah. It just seems a little bit high. Yeah. Not seems, but so 11 I think off the top of my head, 11.4 to 12.6, and that's based on all cause mortality risk, and then obviously increases during aging. That's my optimal range. There it can be tricky, though, below 11.4. Even though that's a rare event in terms of, how many people have RDWs that low, there is a significant increase for all cause mortality risk below 11.4, but the paper that I'm referencing, it, it didn't differentiate where below 11.4. Like, it separated everybody who is 11.4 into, percentiles. So there's just no way to know where below 11.4 that increase in all cause mortality risk was, but, nonetheless, that's a rare thing. Most people don't have RDW below, 11.4. Yeah. I'm a little puzzled because usually on my reference table, I'll have the, the reasoning why I set, my optimal range is where I did. But for RDW, I don't have that. So I couldn't even tell you where I got those optimal values from. Interesting. Alright. So wait. So your average then is somewhere around 13? That's about what it looks like. Yeah. And then This would be my trend line, which I guess is, is plotted on my average, I think. So, yeah, so between twelve point seven and thirteen point seven. Yeah. Maybe 13.2 then. Maybe somewhere in the middle. So, yeah, there too, you had a bunch of data points that were higher, and then you've had lately, you've they you know, they've all been a lot better. So any ideas what you you may have done to flip that? No. No. Actually, I don't, because I I don't know what, what supplements I've been modifying that would have impact on RDW, to be totally honest with you. It's not something I've been targeting. So its movement is a side effect of other things that I've been doing. It's not nothing intentional that I've been doing to move RDW. Interesting. And, you know, whatever you did, because you can see that the what is that? Three, five, eight, ten I mean, thirteen, fourteen, 14 above your average, and then almost all of it below that. You know? So whatever you did, what is that? 2021, 2023, whatever you did there, whatever you changed, I mean, it's made a big dent in bringing it down. So that's good news. Yeah. I, you know, I do have, there's there's different tabs for, every blood test, all of the things that I was targeting for the next test. But, I mean, that would probably take us a good ten minutes for me to drill down and see what it was that I was doing at those particular times. But off the top of my head, I couldn't tell you. See, if if if there was a way that you could drill down on what may have been behind that RDW decrease, I mean, that's like, you know, most people struggle, I think, with RDW and bringing it down and it that it increases during aging and that for, you know, the the majority of, you know, what it whatever that is, the past 15 tests relative to the 15 tests before that, that you've gotten to it to go in the right direction. I mean, I think that's big news. It's just a matter of what may have caused it is, you know, is is the big question. In your case, it's Yeah. Not that you got leaner. Right? I mean, you've been relative your body weight and workouts have been relatively stable, which suggests that it's gotta be something supplement or diet wise. Yeah. Or exercise, maybe. More fit versus less fit or less fit in the above average data and more fit now? Yeah. That's a great question. I probably could drill down, you know, into that data, but it would take me some time to do the investigation. Yeah. One reason I make all the videos I make is because it forces me to try to figure it out and then try to tell that story. So I'm not saying that's what you should do, but it's just, you know, an interesting observation that I think many people could, you know, benefit from. Yeah. I mean, now I'm super curious. Because I before we started talking, I didn't have any of this stuff graphed. So I I would really didn't have this nice pictorial view of my own data to be able to see. Am I going in the right direction or not? So this has helped me quite a bit now that I can see this. So I I can be intentional about things. My RDW, I thought, was usually so stable that, I've never had any intention of moving it intentionally. Interesting. Wow. Yeah. But you but then after you plotted it, you see that you had some variability where it was you know? And and that's not like one test where it's above your average. I mean, that was a lot of tests, and then not the test below. Right? So something really moved the needle there. So Yeah. So now I'll be curious to drill down and find that out for myself. Yeah. And wait. So the most recent data would probably be I mean, it's below that 12.7. So probably around 12.6. Right? Somewhere around there? I mean, we can actually go to the real data if you wanna see that. Go to fluency. For the most recent tests. Okay. So For the most recent test that you have, I guess, what, three tests so far in 2025? Yes. Yes. So So we're looking at 12.7, 12.4, 12.9. And not bad. Not bad. And then wait. Go ahead. I've got four tests. Actually, I've got two of them here from, February because one I did with Life Extension and the other one I did with Ulta Labs. So Gotcha. Alright. Yeah. Not not too bad. I mean, I'd wanna see it 12.5 even closer to 12, but it's a lot better than the, probably, 13 or 14 that you had, you know, two years before that. Alright. So let's shift to to kidney function. So creatinine is also included in pheno age, and then we can also drill down if you have cystatin c and blood urine nitrogen, uric acid. Yeah. I don't do cystat cystat if I can even say it, cystatin c that often, so I don't have very many data points for that. But the rest, I do. So which one in particular did you wanna see? Did you wanna see? Let's let's zoom in on creatinine. Okay. So we're right there. I don't know. If you wanna talk it through it, I should go through it. No. Go for it. You do it. You do it better than I do anyway. So So here. Yeah. I see your trend, 2017, relatively high, and then you've been reducing it over time, which is good news. So most people high points there too. Yeah. Oh, wow. Super high points. Yeah. And I know that's affected by my creatine consumption. Alright. So have you consumed less creatine over time? No. Not intentionally. No. I try to consume the the same amount, but, again, most of that is in with my my morning protein smoothie. And if I'm traveling, which I've been traveling a lot, then I'm haven't been getting my creatine. So that could be another reason why this has decreased. So more traveling over the past, well, eight years? More traveling, less shakes then? No. Like, since I retired. So it would just win those in the past maybe three years. Yeah. But you can see the trend line goes all the way back. I mean, this is 2020. Yeah. Just starting from there. Yeah. Alright. But that could be a part of it. But, anyway, alright. So going in the right direction. So for more insight, blood urine nitrogen. So assuming your protein intake is constant, kidney function declines during aging. And one of the functions of the kidney is to basically remove substances from blood, urea being one of them, blood urea nitrogen being a marker of urea in blood. So if your protein protein intake is a constant, when considering kidney function declines during aging, if blood urine nitrogen has increased, then that would suggest, reduced kidney function. But, again, key point is if your protein intake has been a constant. Well, here's my my blood urea nitrogen, and it has been increasing. Yeah. But I I get you've increased protein intake over the past eight years? Yeah. Again, I don't think that I have. I think I'm still saying staying pretty consistent with my protein intake. Yeah. So this is an interesting one because the creatinine decrease suggests better kidney function. But if that's just a measure of less creatine, we may be masking the real situation. And if your protein intake levels have been stable over time, this could be related to a decrease in kidney function, but we'd have to have more specificity in terms of, you know, how much protein were you consuming, how much is it now. Yeah. We can we can look at stuff like, you know, eGFR, which declines with age. So eGFR is derived from creatinine. So this is basically the same the same measure. Yeah. Like, the equation uses creatinine in in the in the measure. But uric acid, uric acid can give us more insight. So if uric acid is also increasing like blood urine nitrogen, that would suggest that we're on the wrong side of kidney function. So let's see. My uric acid oh, there's my cystatin. See? Two data. Two only two data points. That's it. Yeah. Do you do you have plans to measure that more often or not so? I I do now. I before, I didn't really realize it was a, a worthwhile variable to be looking at. So besides, it's it's as a marker, it's less sensitive to changes in muscle mass, relative to creatinine as a marker of kidney function. But besides that, it, so, you know, GRIM age, the DNA methylation test GRIM age. So GrimAge is the and this isn't hyperbole. You know? This is the GrimAge is the best epigenetic clock for its association with all cause mortality risk. So I have a paper open in my tabs where it looked at all cause mortality risk, head to head matchup, PhenoAge, not the PhenoAge, you know, the blood base, the DNA methylation, estimation of PhenoAge, Horvath, Hannum, Dunedin Pace. And the clock that had the largest, association with all cause mortality was by far was GrimAge. So then it raises the question, what is GrimAge trained on? And one of the proteins that, you know, so you've got, so it's seven proteins, and it's smoking, smoking pack years, and I think chronological age. And it's right? So they they took actual levels of those nine variables. If I'm leaving one out, you know, whoever's watching that's gonna grill me on that, forgive me, but seven proteins. Right? So they took those actual measures and then did the epigenetic prediction and then use that epigenetic prediction for all cause mortality risk. So of those seven proteins, the statins is on the list. But then note that just like PhenoAge where RDW was strongest predictor, or strongest contributor to the PhenoAge number, all seven proteins didn't contribute to the GrimAge, in value. Right? So some are more stronger contributors than others. For example, leptin is on that list, and leptin was basically weak, you know, but still significant in the GrimAge prediction. Cystatin c's correlation with the overall GrimAge score was very high. It was, like, point nine. So I've included that on every test now going forward. You know, for me, I'd rather have the actual biomarkers rather than the prediction GRIMH. Yeah. Yeah. So which ones do you do every time now? Cystatin c and leptin? Both? Not leptin. So, actually, leptin because it was so weak. And leptin's proportional to fat mass. So, you know, we're already lean. I can't imagine it's gonna be high. Now granted, if I started to increase body fat, I'd I'd see higher leptin. But so leptin is a low value one for me. Beta two microglobulin is also on that list. That's, and that I I'm including that for the first time next week. I'm gonna do that for every test. That's I have one test for each of those. That's why they didn't show up in the graphs. Uh-huh. Nice. So I need at least two data points for those to show. Gotcha. But those are the two big ones that I'm gonna measure. The other ones, like GDF 15, not commercially available, but very strong predictive of grim age. And there are a couple other ones, like temp one some or temp something. Never heard of it before. Very strong predictor. And then PAI one, but it's it's, core that's commercially available, but its correlation was weaker. Yeah. So cystatin c is not in one of my my normal panels, so I would just have to add do that as an add on from here on out. Yeah. I think it's important. I'm gonna keep including it, trying to get it as low as possible. So my uric acid, you mentioned that. That should show up here somewhere else, but, it's not showing up as a kidney health marker. Mhmm. Maybe it's maybe it's listed as a liver health marker. I don't know. Yeah. Uric acid. Very good. Alright. So let's let's zoom in on that one. That one at least looks like it's going in the right direction. Yeah. Definitely. So so this is this is good news. That so the way I interpret this is, you know, the decreased creatine, less creatinine. So we can't say anything about your kidney function yet, because it may be influenced by creatine. Your bun is probably impacted by protein intake. And the reason I say that is because your uric acid is decreasing. If kidney function was declining, I'd expect to see an age related increase for uric acid, not a decrease, with lower moving towards lower all cause mortality risk. So this is this is good news. Then the next question is when considering your bun is increasing, so, urea and blood is formed, from nitrogen. So your body will remove nitrogen, say, from proteins and then form urea. So urea has two nitrogen groups. So then it raises the question, is your protein intake a bit too high? And, because urea isn't just the metabolite in blood. So urea in very high levels can circulate to the intestine where it can degrade the tight junctions, allowing for more stuff to leak into the blood. Now is that at your, current level? I don't remember. I think it was like eighteen or nineteen milligrams per deciliter. Is that high enough to do that? I don't know. Don't know. But that'd be that could be something to experiment with as suggestion, you know, maybe cutting protein intake ten or twenty grams and seeing if that reduces blood urine nitrogen, but then also maybe you get a boost in other biomarkers too. Because if it's too high for blood urine nitrogen, and that is allowing for stuff to leak into the blood, you may may see changes, whether it's HSCRP or alkaline phosphatase. We can look at those too. So here's the, the total protein that you were interested in. So total protein is more a marker of albumin plus globulins. So not necessarily a marker of protein intake. And so, you know, it in very old people, usually albumin is thought of as a marker of malnutrition, but anecdotally, I don't know. In my data, protein intake doesn't correlate with albumin, globulins, or total protein. It's more tightly regulated than that, but we can shift from from the kidney now to liver. So albumin would be mostly a marker of liver health and function. Okay. I mean, anything you wanna see specifically, I can I can pull up? So So, wait. So this is good news. So albumin declines during aging. You've got it going in the right direction, pretty close to optimal. That's, like, what, four point well, 4.5 ish current values? Roughly around there. Yeah. Yeah. And you've got that, yeah, 4.5 to eight, I think. So, yeah, right now so, so, yeah, you've moved this in the right direction. I mean, that's good. That's great news. So albumin is probably the most underrated biomarker, at least my perspective. So I've mentioned this in other places, but when you think about the concentration of albumin, you see it on the y axis. It's in grams per deciliter. Right? So your value of four point five grams is forty five hundred milligrams per deciliter. So most people are hot on glucose or lipoproteins. Even the best glucose, 80 milligrams per deciliter. So now you've got albumin, 4,500 milligrams per deciliter versus glucose, 80 milligrams per deciliter. Albumin just based on concentration is six and a half times higher based on concentration in blood. So, okay, total cholesterol, 200 milligrams per deciliter versus, sorry. I said 4,500 versus 80. That's sixty sixty five times higher. Right? If I'm doing if my math is math if I'm math incorrectly. Don't look at me. I I don't do math in my head anymore. Yeah. I I gotta I'm I'm maybe off by a factor of 10. Let me just yeah. It's 60 fold higher. Same thing same thing for, total cholesterol. 200 milligrams per deciliter versus 4,500 milligrams per deciliter. So albumin is more concentrated than both of those. Now where it gets tricky in that in that, interpretation is that albumin is a big protein. Right? So you have to factor in its molecular weight. And when you do that, it's basically a big tree floating in the forest, and, obviously, there's more glucose and lipoproteins in blood. But it's a giant tree floating around that most people don't think anything about. So, keeping it relatively high and avoiding that age related decline, top tier in my eyes. We we've got some bad ones. My bilirubin is supposed to be stable with aging, but it looks like it's on the decline. Yeah. So that can go in two two ways. Right? So to interpret it in two ways. One is that lower levels are found in youth, and they increase during aging. And and centenarians actually have relatively higher levels of bilirubin. Like, you know, we're talking double where your levels are. And, so then the question is, do you wanna have them higher or lower lower knowing that centenarians have higher levels? But bilirubin can act as an antioxidant. So I think in centenarians, it's more of a compensatory mechanism where, you know, their antioxidant defense enzymes may not be good, So they've got a increased bilirubin levels by degrading red blood cells and degrading degrading hemoglobin. So it I'd say lower is better and keeping it low indefinitely is better and avoiding the age related increase. So this is good news that it's moved in the right direction. Yeah. Yeah. I was gonna say the fact that I'm, you know, decreasing, at least I'm heading into my my optimal and within the reference ranges because I was way outside of the reference range previously. Yeah. That suggests you had some oxidative stress going on. That that would be my interpretation. Some oxidative stress going on with the very high bilirubin's. What was triggering it, though? I mean, that's the billion dollar question. Yeah. And then what have you done to reduce it? Right? Also, billion dollar question. Again, I don't think that was one I was targeting specifically. Mhmm. Oh, the the things that you're seeing here are side effects from other things that I was targeting. Is there a way to go back and see, like because you can see that there's a cut point. Right? Like, where it was Right there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Whatever you did there, it shifted the balance. Yeah. And I wish I could tell you exactly when that was. I guess I can go back to the raw data and take a look. Yeah. So we're looking for oh, gosh. Well, it looks like it's around 2021. So it's Billy Rubin. It's probably right in front of my face. Oh, I think there you go. Billy Rubin. I'm sorry. I got I have to zoom out just so I can see more of the, more of the ranges here. So let me get into 2021. So 2020. Yeah. 02/2004. Yeah. So it was probably right around between no. That's '20 yeah. 2020. So it looks like I was in the twos and the 1.7 in 2020. And then around November 2020, I dropped down to 0.9, and then it looks like it consistently stayed lower. Were there supplements or HBOT or red light, some therapy or something that you did that started in 2021? Again, I've got the data. It would be it would be tabs that I would have to go drill down into and and really go investigate. Not now. If you wanna do that, right, Paul? Right. That would that would take us forever. I don't think people have the patience for that. Part part three and part four, if you want it to be feel like digging into your own data. Yeah. Yeah. So, again, I mean, this is really the first time I'm seeing these graphs right right now with you. I was working on the generation of them all up until this point. So, this is all new to me as it is, you know, as my data is to you. We're looking at it. So Nice. Alright. So let's go back to liver. Let's, like AST, ALT, and GGT if you have it. Okay. So here's, AST, ALP. Which one would you like to look at first? Oh, AST, ALT. We'll check out a l a l p to us. You have g g t the way. Do you have a a l t if you scroll up a little bit? Is that one of the plots? It it is on here. It's just probably off the screen. So let me minimize here again. ALT. Yeah. ALT is right there. There we go. Yeah. Right there. Alright. So, yeah, moving moving moving in the right direction. Values in the high teens, low twenties associated with lowest all cause mortality risk. I mean, here too, data moving in the right direction. So, the biggest question is what did you do? You know? Yeah. And I wish I had, like, done that research that I could tell you on this pod. So Yeah. But I, you know, couldn't tell you right now. Alright. Good news nonetheless. Alright. So AST, I'm guessing we'll see a similar trend for AST. There we go. AST. Alright. Same same direction. Yeah. Wait. So still a bit high, though. Most most recent tests are in the thirties. Right? High thirties, 35. Yeah. We've gotta get that low. Way out of the reference range here for most of these. So I'm now in the reference range, and I'm getting back into my very little, very narrow optimal range. Yeah. Yeah. Most recent tests are still relatively high, though. Yeah. So there is at least one paper where GGT was compared against AST and ALT for, liver disease related mortality, and GGT was, like, the highest GGT levels. The highest ten percent GGT was associated with an eightfold higher risk of death from liver disease mortality. Whereas the highest AST and ALT was like a fourfold higher risk. So that suggests that GGT when it's high is a better marker of liver disease mortality risk. So it in your case, let well, less than 12 is associated with lowest risk, all cause mortality risk, very large study, sixteen million people. So your GGT data is fantastic. I mean, even where you started 12.75, that trend. I mean, you have a few data points above that, but Yeah. Lower is better for GGT. So, you know, it suggests that, your liver health is good, but something's triggering your AST to be high. It could be supplements. I I don't know what, you know, is the liver, you know, is is, detox, you know, phase two detoxification. So it could be that something is triggering that and causing some liver damage. But the good news is that GGT is low, which could be a better marker. More recently, I've been experimenting a little with TUTCA, so that might be helping some of these values. Or as I continue, it might help with some of these values. Yeah. I don't know enough about it. I I think it's involved with, like, cholestasis. So people who have cholesterol buildup in the liver and then liver dysfunction, but I don't know. Maybe it's a different, bile acid that I'm thinking of that you can take as a supplement. I'm gonna have to look into TUDCA, t u d c a. Mhmm. Toro uso deoxycholic acid. Oh, wow. Okay. Oh, man. I do it. It's good for me. I do. Alright. You must be a doctor or something. Right. So ALP ALP is moving in the wrong direction. I don't know that it increases during aging because the studies that I've I've come across, it's it's variable where it's generally flat. But there aren't very large epidemiological studies, like, for a lot of the other biomarkers to make a an accurate assessment if it increases during aging or not. But all cause mortality risk above 48, it is associated with higher risk. So, I mean, you're just outside that. It's not too far away from optimal, and moving well, but moving in the wrong direction. Yeah. But you had very low levels. I mean, that's just amazing. I I don't think I've seen ALP levels as low as thirty, thirty two. So, again, I would be curious to see what, you know, what happened again in this time frame where things were low and then they went high, then they went low. Oh, yeah. That high. And then the that split that I don't know if this split is as dramatic because I can't see the the dates as well on the bottom. Yeah. They're too bunched up. Yeah. But is is that split where, you know, granted, in this case, it's a few data points that were lower and then a lot more that are variable. Is that 2020 versus 2021 again? Yeah. We got zeros showing here and ones up at the top. So, this would be right at the end of 2020 and all through 2021. But then but then they increase. You get them decreasing for a lot of tests, and then they're increasing again. It's back at 2023, 2024. They went high again, and they're working back down again for 2025. So, yeah, I'm at a loss to account for why that is. Yeah. I mean, that's a big part of what I do is trying to figure out what moves what to try to you know? That's the biggest challenge without tracking without tracking, you know, I mean, that's something we could look into. Right? Which is, like, do you have variability in your supplements? Like, you'll take a list of supplements? Not typically. No. The the biggest variability that's in my life is whether I'm running or training for a marathon or not. But the supplements in terms of the amounts stable from test to test? Generally. Yeah. Interesting. So so so you think some of this is related to marathon training volume? Oh, I have no clue. I'm just I'm just grasping at straws at this point because that's just one major factor that I know that changes a lot. To to think to address that, you've been tracking I mean, how long have you been you've been wearing Whoop? Oh, yeah. For, gosh. Probably I'm thinking not quite ten years maybe. Wow. So I don't know if it's been that long. Maybe So a long time, which could correlate we could correlate, the average daily heart rate, which is in the export. And we could see, you know, basically so you have when you did each of these tests. So we could take the average daily heart rate in between, you know, so say day one, day 50. Now we have fifty days average daily heart rate in between tests. That lines up with the latter test. So each test would have would have an average daily heart rate, and then we could see is is average daily heart rate which biomarkers is average daily heart rate associated with going in the wrong direction for biomarkers and right direction? In other words, higher training volumes may positively impact some biomarkers, but not others. And then do we get to the bigger question? And I'm not trying to modify your training training volume, but it could suggest an optimal training volume to try to get more biomarkers moving in the right direction versus wrong. So a big light bulb just came on for my in my brain, because as I'm looking at my own data and trying to figure out, like, what was my life doing at that time? So prior to 2020, yeah, this might make some sense. I was, still taking care of my parents. So I was still forced to, you know, eat a lot of their food. I was not eating my own food like the grass fed meats, you know, just cleaner, which, you know, shouldn't really account for these things going up. But I also became became more intentional with my supplementation. So, I'm thinking that possibly it's when I did begin, my full court press on supplementation. So 2020 versus 2021 for that. But then that wouldn't that wouldn't explain the increase from, you know, 2022 up. Like, you see, it's it's pretty low for, like, 10 tests, and then there's a trend for it to go for the most recent, say, 15 tests. Like, it would go up. Yeah. So there was a lot of experimentation with my supplements throughout that that time. So it's it's more most likely a supplement that was causing the changes. Yeah. So that too. Like, if if you if we took the average supplement intake or even, you know, if this if you have a core list of supplements that doesn't change test to test and you know only which supplements that you've added in or taken out for a period, And then, you know, having that lined up for every test. I know it's a lot of work. It's probably something you don't wanna do, but that might get closer to what might be impacting what. Additionally, I was also working on my hormones at that point. So I was trying to get my thyroid, dialed in. So there was a lot of thyroid medication changes throughout that time. So, I mean, there's confounding variables upon count founding variables here. I I don't think I've ever heard the thyroid story because I just recently, was able to finally switch get started on switching my meds too for that. So what what was your thyroid? I've been in supplementation probably for the past thirty some years. Yeah. And the endocrinologist that I saw had put me on a very, very high dose of, t four. And when I finally started looking at some of my my thyroid markers, I knew they were out of whack, so I went to see an endocrinologist to argue with her for my change in medication. And one of the first things she well, one of the first things she started arguing with me about when she found out I was a biohacker, was that, you know, my medication was way out of whack, and I shouldn't be taking that high a medication. Of course, I had to explain to her, I did not pick that. Her father picked that. So to, yeah, change her tune quickly after that. But, yes. So we did a lot of changes over a period of months of decreasing my dosage of t four. And then at one point, we ended up even including some t three because I wasn't converting properly. So what was the dose of t four that you were initially on? I'm thinking it was, like, two fifty micrograms. Holy cow. Yeah. It was high. Do you know what your free t four was? Do you remember that just ballpark what that was? We could probably go take a look at that. I'm sure that's in here. But we can actually look at that. We can chart that if you wanna see it. Uh-huh. Interesting. So let's go to thyroid health. Okay. So which one you wanna see first? Oh, wait. So, yeah, that's free t four. So, yeah, early on, I can see values high as two on the left. Oh, you're looking at t three, but on the left, free T fours on the on the on the on my left. Right? Free T three? Just one? No. Above that. I'm looking at free T four. Sorry. Alright. Let me just zoom in. So you had values higher than two. Shit. Look, I had one way up here at six. Well, it's crazy. That's crazy. That's that's like, that's crazy that they they would do that. Yeah. Alright. And then still getting lower. I'm aiming now for values around point eight, even lower, maybe lower than the point seven five. Free t four increases. It it thyroxine increases during aging. That's without a doubt. So lower is generally better and all cause mortality risk lower is better. Alright. So free t three? Your average but this is with, obviously, this is with, prescription. Correct. And you see them all over the place on that one. Yeah. So my data, actually, your lowest data, 2.5, I'm consistently like, so you see below the red line. You have yeah. All of my data for, like, eight or nine tests in a row since I started, you know, digging deeper into this and not taking my endocrinologist for you know, just take t four. I I just assumed, oh, they know better. And then I was like, no. What I'm gonna look into it. All of my data has been 2.5, 2.3, and it that's too low. I mean, like, you have. It declines during aging and lower levels are associated with an increased all cause mortality risk. So you've had a very high too, though. I mean, my gosh. Yeah. So what's your current dose of what is it? Cygnus, Cytomel? Or I mean, When you think about that, think I'm on one thirty seven micrograms. Of cytomel? So t three? I believe so. Man. Yeah. Oh, no. No. I'm sorry. That's t four. Yeah. T three, I think I'm on twenty five micrograms. Oh, not bad. Interesting. How many tests did it take to to get you onto that? So you you basically cut t four in half. Yeah. It took, many, many months because she didn't want it's like, I think there was a good six months between each test because she didn't wanna test any more frequent than that. Yeah. So I I know we changed a couple of times through there, but I clearly couldn't tell you what the increments were. Do you know what her rationale was for not testing every six months or more than six months? No. I don't think there actually was a rationale other than she didn't think the markers moved that quickly. That's ridiculous. I mean, T four, T three, when you take a pill of t three, it rises rapidly in blood. So there's another confounding variable with my data because there were times when that I would take my blood test before taking my morning medication, other times that I took it after. Uh-huh. So that's gonna change some of these values. Right? So when you when you test now, it's totally fast. It just water, nothing else? Yeah. That's what I've been trying to do. I've I've also, like, just I've been intentional about the last couple of tests. I think the last two tests I took, I did, like, well, maybe the last three tests. I tried two hours after taking the medication, then four hours, and now I'm going for six hours. So I wanna see what the what the difference is in that. Interesting. Why not just test first thing in the morning and not do any meds before the test? I have done that, and everything shows really low, of course, because there is no, you know, there isn't any, I endogenous stuff floating in my system at that point. But then I I don't really know what the medication is doing when it's in. So, I mean, I know what things are gonna be like when I'm off the medication, but, you know, what is the medication? Am I on the proper dose of medication is what I'm trying to figure out. Yeah. Even if you took your medic so when you take your, t four and t three, do you take it in one dose? Are you taking it in split doses? No. Just one dose. So t three has a rep so t four has a relatively long half life. So once per day can work for that, but t three has a shorter half life. Pretty short. Yeah. So I've been taking mine twice per day. I mean, my doctor said take it three times per day. I'm not taking it three times per day. I looked at I can send you I can send you the, the, circadian rhythm for t three, the normal circadian rhythm for for t three, and it peaks, like, two to 4AM, and then it also peaks at nine in the morning. So I've been taking my t three with t four, some of it in the morning soon like, 9AM. And then before I go to bed, I'm taking, what is it? Ten ten micrograms of cytomel so that I can get some of that peak in the middle of the night to try to you know, after a couple hours, it'll be absorbed so so that I should get that peak in the middle of the night, and then I'm taking it nine in the morning. So I should get that peak. So my body looks like it's getting it should get on that normal circadian rhythm for, what a healthy thyroid looks like. And just to be clear, the cytomill is the t three? T three. Yeah. T three. Okay. Yeah. So I've got a two split two doses. We did discuss that last time with my new doctor, not my endocrinologist, my my current, you know, regular standard doctor. We may we may look into that for this next period. Yeah. So when when considering that, if you're taking it before you go to bed, you may not need to, you know, titrate the dose in the morning before a blood test. I mean, before bed, you should still have some amount that's still in the blood. Then it would be valuable, I think, to take it completely fasted without my morning dose and then do the blood test to see. Yeah. F t three, free t three to free t four ratio. Have you plotted that? Yes. Let me get this out of the way. That's over here. And what's crazy about that too is, like, you know, I'm sure for the longest time with your blood test, they just did a t s TSH and and, free t four and didn't even measure f t three. Oh, yeah. If I was relying strictly on my my doctor or endocrinologist test, yes. They were not measuring anything. It was just usually TSH is, like, all they look at. Yeah. So the only reason I have the these other data point is data points are because I did them myself. So how did you how did you look into the or you were just curious about how can I optimize thyroid function, and then you were like, oh, I should be measuring f t three? Wow. Yeah. Because I was working on everything else, and I had everything else I thought pretty well locked in, except my thyroid markers were way out of whack. Once I started working on the thyroid markers, it just everything else just went to crap. So then I had to start all over again with trying to dial down everything else. So when did you get your sorry. With so f t three, f t four. I was gonna say, when did you get that ratio, to relative where it is now relatively high? And then it looks like it's more recently that you've gotten it, or it's this is a trend. The trend over time has been you've been moving it in the right direction. Yeah. Last couple of tests, I've still got some things that see, no. This is interesting. So my reference range is here lower than I have my optimal ranges. Oh, I mean, there may be some units. So you gotta, when when you have f t three, it depends that you gotta get the units because you usually, it's like point point three five, point three seven is useful. So there may be a unit difference because your the scale, you've got it in, like, you know, digits 3.7 and maybe a a unit being off where it should be, like, point three six seven and point two six seven. But it's the same it it it should be the same idea nonetheless. But, but moving in the right direction, wait. So have you felt a difference in moving? No. No. Just Not at all. Work out. The other maddening thing. I never knew I had a thyroid issue to begin with. Oh, man. I never I never felt anything. You're supposed to have, like, oh, gosh. You're you're supposed to be tired all the time. You're supposed to gain weight. You're supposed to have, you know, lack of interest in sex. No. I had none of that. The only symptoms I had were, like, my nose would occasionally be cold, maybe fingers, maybe toes. That's it. I just assumed everybody had that. And then after since your thyroid, the f t three, f t four has been increasing, cold nose, cold fingers, and toes less or same? Less. But, of course, you know, most of the time when I'm indoors in the summertime, people have the air conditioning cranked up so high. It's it's hard to tell. I mean, most people I know are wearing gloves anyway. So That's interesting that you don't feel a difference. I mean, so I I've that my battle for hypothyroidism is that whole thing, like, get good sleep, still tired. You know, I could sleep I could always sleep. I you know, I'm you know, fingers and toes, always cold. Nose, always cold. So, I even did an experiment on myself a few years back. This maybe be, five or six years ago. I decided to just go cold turkey and just stop taking all my thyroid medication because I wanted to see what would happen. And, again, I didn't feel anything. I didn't feel any difference. But after maybe it was a month, I started noticing, like, bags forming under my eyes, like, really bad bags. And I started noticing my hairline was thinning. And so it was the vanity aspect of it all that put me right back on it again. Oh, so I did that experiment too. I stopped all thyroid meds. TSH went way up, and I felt even more tired than your How's your DHT? Yeah. DHT has always been relatively high. I haven't paid attention to it in a long time, but when I measured it, like, twenty five years ago, which is when this, started to go, it was relatively high. And I didn't do anything. I just let it are you taking specific things for DHT to inhibit, the conversion? I do. Stinging nettle is one thing that's supposed to help with DHT. Tongkat Ali is supposed to help with that. Wouldn't the the the inhibition of DHT need to be localized? I mean, granted, if I'm inhibiting if my DHT levels systemically are low, that would assume that less would make it to my scalp, but you'd want DHT inhibition in the scalp. Yeah. Topically, I guess that's that's something that people do. Yeah. But you don't do that? I don't do that. If my hair was shorter, I probably could get away with that. But the fact that it's long, it's really difficult to get things to the roots. You know, even trying to wear, like, a red light helmet, it's my hair is too thick right now. I'd probably have to shave it down, and then then a red light helmet would actually be effective. Yeah. I'm I I just shave it. I don't know. Even if I did have hair, I'd probably just shave it anyway. That's just I'm not opposed to actually shaving my hair. It's just that, you know, my dad was always opposed to long hair hippie freaks. And so while he was alive, I could never keep my hair at any length without him having a derogatory comment to make about it. So after he passed, and we hit the pandemic when everything shut down, February 2020 was, you know, the last haircut that I've had. So just let it all go just for the fun of it. Cool. Do you grow the beard out too? Just as a side note, George, just keep it trim. You know, I started to, and then a a friend commented. It was it was sort of a drunken comment across the table. I think he was trying to be helpful, but I'm not really sure. He said that, if I wanted to appear younger, I should probably shave the beard closer. That you know, even though it was sort of like a kind of a I think it was a backhanded compliment, there was a lot of truth in that. And so now I I tend to wear it a lot a lot shorter. But is it is it I haven't obviously, I haven't seen your beard longer in that case to to assess that, but it's the white hairs in the beard, but you right? You dye it. So I dye my hair. Yeah. Absolutely. But if you had if you were dyeing it in and it was longer, I don't know. Would it would the hair just look older and that would make you make you look older? Probably. Probably. But I would no. I would even dye I was dyeing it even though it was longer. I just had to dye more more hair surface. So it was still dark, but it was just bushy. And somehow that made me look older. I don't know. If you keep it close shaved, it it it's got that youthful look like, you know, you're just going through puberty, and you're just finally getting hair. Right. Right. Right. Well, when I let mine grow out, there's white hairs there. So for sure, shaving it, I get some some more youthful look relative to the you know? So the funny thing is I I shave my chest hair because I I have a quite hairy chest. But if I have dark hair, dark beard, you know, dark arms, dark eyebrows, it looks really funny to have a gray chest. So I've been shaving that probably since my thirties. But now I don't even know what I can attribute it to. My chest hair and my beard hair when I don't dye them are, like, fifty fifty. Ah. They've taken on some dark color again. So it was totally white and then went back to Yeah. 100%. Mhmm. NMN or something in in that Who knows? You know, I'm taking so many different things. It's it's hard to tell. And, you know, I know that drives drive people crazy because they're like, well, how do you know what's doing it? To be honest, I don't care. As long as I'm trending in the right direction, I'm happy. Right? I don't care what that one thing is. Yeah. I mean, I hope people are finding this interesting because I'd hate to think that we're boring them to death. But I I know I'm always glued to these when you show these and you do your markers with with your friend. I'm always like, I'm taking copious notes and but I'm weird. So Yeah. So even if it's a handful of people, the way I see it is like, this is the way. Like, I think everybody should be tracking multiple things over time. Like, now granted, what's moving the needle? Okay. Fine. That that's more devils in the details. But, just like you, I'm not bored either, and I'm I'm sure that there's gonna be people who aren't bored. And even if it's a handful, you know, this is how we move move the crowd. Right? We've gotta move the field into testing. You know, even even, you know, I like Michael Greger because he tries to use the published evidence, you know, the support positions. But he's recently dive dive into the NAD field and NMN, and and he I'm just using him as an example. I don't wanna pick on him, but there's so much of this, hey. If you do this because it's been shown in a published study, you can get the same effect, but yet he's not measuring it himself. Other people who are who are making similar claims aren't measuring it. Like, I'm just so tired of that mindset of this happened in this study. So if I do it, it'll it'll work. No. I think the future is just like you're showing with your data, it's testing. We we can test ourselves. These things exist for us to test all the time. You know? And, what is the optimal, you know, driver's manual for for me, for you? And it's probably different. Right? And what does that recipe? Right? So, even if it's just a handful of people, I I see tremendous value here and that you've got so much data. I mean, when we think about it, you know, we're, of course, we have we're different genders among the population. You know, we're different ages, so we need different things at different times, you know, because our bodies stop producing the things that we might need, and so we might need a little boost from outside. We have different microbiomes that break these things down. We have different genetics and epigenetics that cause us to absorb or not absorb them the same way. And there's just so many variables. So when somebody comes out with a, you know, one size fits all supplement, I just kinda scoff at that because you know, one size doesn't fit all. Have there been interventions that you've seen work in a published study that you've tried that didn't work or didn't move the needle the way you expected? Yes. But I would be completely unable to give you a great example right now at the top of my head. Because I have tried, you know, I try I'm I'm a skeptic at everything, to be honest with you. I try things with the intention of proving that it does not work. And then if it does work, I'm pleasantly surprised. But when it doesn't work, I'm I'm not surprised at all. Yeah. I I've got a bunch, like, liver enzymes. My liver enzymes are trending in close to the forties, high thirties, low forties. No alcohol. How's that how's that possible? And it was like, ten years ago. So I cut down on green tea, green tea, you know, too much green tea can damage liver. That wasn't it. But yet it worked in a published study, High fructose, too much fruit. I cut the fructose down. That didn't do it. So it it may have been too much omega six at the time. It could have been body weight because now my data is closer, you know, to optimal high teens, low twenties. But the stuff that's been published didn't do anything. Right? Imagine if I just took on hope based on what worked in others and they work in me. Right? I mean, the only way to know is to test. So Now that you mentioned it, I I can't think of, like, green tea, I thought, was supposed to be really, really good for me. So I would mix a very heavy, dose of green tea, black tea, oolong tea, you know, you know, gosh, Emperor's Puerre. I mean, all the teas are supposed to be really good for you. I was brewing them in my, like, Mr. Coffee or whatever, my Mr. Tea Maker and drinking them pretty strong thinking that that would be good. But, no, I think it's like the tannins or whatever that are in the teas were were causing an absorption issue for, like, my iron was super low. My b vitamins were deficient. You know, as soon as I stopped taking or drinking that tea every morning, everything just kinda popped right back up where it should. So, you know, side effects. You always get side effects. Something that's, you know, can be healthy for you done in too much of excess becomes unhealthy. So no tea? You you no tea now? You're not drinking any tea? Nope. I would love to add it back in, but it seems like every time I do it, it causes something else to go go wrong. Coffee? Nope. Don't drink coffee. I don't usually do caffeine at all. Interesting. Alright. Save caffeine for when I really need it. So, like, if I'm on a long drive somewhere and I need to stay awake, then when I do caffeine, wow, it works. So in that case, coffee or Mountain Dew, what do you what do you go for? Mountain Dew? No. I, you know, I'm embarrassed to say, but the five hour energy shots do the trick for me. Yeah. So I on long driving trips, that's what I've done in the past is Mountain Dew. So yeah. Five hour energy's in the same ballpark. You know what I mean? Just as bad. Maybe I don't know if it has the same amount of sugar as Mountain Dew because it definitely doesn't rot my stomach out like Mountain Dew does. But Alright. So we jump in. We'll start off, I guess. You wanna start off with immune? Neutrophil absolute. Yeah. Alright. So just as a a a background. So, you know, white blood cells are in PhenoAge, but, white blood cells aren't a homogeneous group. Right? So they've got neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, eosinophils. So I don't pay much attention to the basophils and eosinophils because they're very, very small, you know, numbers. The almost 95 or more are the neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. So I focus on that. But then there too, there's some disparity because the neutrophils and monocytes increase during aging, and lymphocytes decrease during aging. So if we're only focused on, and I know you're not, but there might be people out there who look at pheno age or white blood cells, and they think, oh, my white blood cells are in range. They could be within range for fifty years and lymphocytes increasing, not sorry, neutrophils increasing, lymphocytes decreasing, and white blood cell stays stable, but the data is going in the wrong direction. That's a pro inflammatory phenotype. So I find the most value in looking at the, you know, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. Alright. So your data your data is pretty flat. So the trend line gets you just above what is that like? Two you've got 2,000, the LuskGuard optimal range, 2,000 to 3,000 for neutrophils, looks like in green? Yes. Yes. I do. Cool. So, yeah, aiming for the lower end of the range, should be optimal. That's based on all cause mortality risk. The question of how low knowing that they increase during aging, somewhat debatable. I mean, 1,600, seventeen, eighteen hundred. Is that, you know, really less optimal compared to 2100? So there is an increase in all cause mortality risk less than two thousand, but, I'm guessing there probably is reverse causation there where people who have very low neutrophil levels may also have inflammation. So for those for those tests where you've got less than 2,000, I'd look to see, you know, was at least HS CRP, low. Right? So point three milligrams per liter or somewhere in that ballpark. If it was, like, one, one point two with no low low neutrophils, it would suggest to me that there may be a problem in making neutrophils, and then whatever's there would be, you know, increasing inflammation. Remind me to go back to, HSCRP after we do with this. We'll take a look at that. Sure. It's it's on today's list, Dave. It's on today's list. Okay. Okay. Oh, good. You've got a list. Alright. I love it. Yeah. I have it all mapped out. Alright. So neutrophils neutrophils look good, especially because that trend line is right at the bottom of the of the reference rate or not the rep the optimal range. And then, yeah, lymphocytes decline during aging. And that's what we see here too. Right? So, so, yeah, that your data, the trend line, I mean, granted, it's just a few data points, but if you look at, say, 2021, we had more tests starting with more tests. I mean, even there, you're starting from about 1,300 and then declining to around now 1,100. So that's a big one. We wanna get those closer to two thousand if we can. That that's what's, most likely found in youth based on population based averages, and it's associated with lowest risk of death for all causes. So Wow. So I'm I'm way below two thousand then. For now. Yeah. But that you have variability in that data. So, for example, you know, just even last year, you had close to sixteen hundred, fifteen hundred. So it's just a matter of what's the recipe where you avoid, like, 900, which you you saw last year. You saw two years ago, 900. You know, how can you avoid the lows and have more of these highs? Even if you just go from, like, 1,300 to 1,600, flatten out that curve, you know, that's that would be the first start in trying to figure out what's, you know, what to do to, you know, resist the age related decline. Like, monocytes. It's definitely malleable, I should say, too, the lymphocytes. So mine recently have declined too, but I think that's dietary change. So I'm doing a bunch of stuff and mine have been as low as $12.57. I've never had them lower over the past ten years. So we'll see if I can reverse it to get it back to where, you know, it should be. Yeah. I'm gonna be curious to see what what levers I can push to make those move. Yeah. Alright. So monocytes. Yeah. So monocytes increase during aging so that you've, resisted that is good news. And the values are pretty good too, you know, around, like, point. I mean, look at how we have got two, like, straight lines and I kinda ping pong between. Yeah. It yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what that's about. That's kind of interesting. It could be it could be that, so sometimes the lab report will say, like, monocytes 8%, and then it'll say, point three three hundred, you know, cells per microliter. Whereas if you took the total white blood cells and then multiply it by that 8%, you get the actual number versus the rounded number. So it could be that you just wrote down. So it might be, you know, point three. You wrote down point threes instead of multiplying white blood cells by the percentage of monocytes. I mean, I usually just I have I have it scripted where this just pulls it right off of the, PDF, for the library. So Yeah. So it's like either because it looks like it's either point two or point three. So they they round it down instead of giving the actual number. But it you can see anyway, it's in the ballpark. Right? But, you know, it's not it's not gonna change your data from, you know, point two to point three range to point four to point six range. You know what I mean? It's it's a rounding issue in your case. So, yeah, increases during aging, so you're you should be good here too. And then platelets too. Platelets are contribute to immune defense. So let's see. I think these are alphabetized. So platelets no. No. They're not alphabetized. Alright. So maybe I rolled past platelets. That'll be the next thing I work on is alphabetizing these so I can find them easier. Yeah. And just be an easy easy sort of the the data before I chart them. Oh, wait. Lipacide percentage? But before we go to For sure. Yeah. Yeah. So that too yeah. That don't definitely declines during aging, higher being potentially better. And I say potentially because as far as I know, there are no studies all cause mortality risk. All we have is the aging data. So this kinda ties in with your lymphocyte levels, declining. Right? So, basically, total white blood cells are stable. Lymphocytes are declining, so the percentage is declining. So, At least within this, I'm kinda within my optimal range mainly. Yeah. But then then, you know, so even there too, like, you know, if you think about centenarians, if if if, you know so if the glucose reference range is 80 to 94 and you've got a centenarian who's 93, you could say or I don't know if that's the best example. Maybe using, like, I don't know, TNF alpha or something. If the ref if the in inflammation if the inflammatory marker is less than three and they're at 2.8. Right? So how much of aging is if they had kept their were able to keep their TNF alpha, like, point three and avoid it getting the 2.8? Is that just the aged phenotype where now, you know, you're in range, but it's been increasing over time. You know? Yeah. Yeah. It's a it's a hard one. We you know, we've gotta resist age related change and have it in the optimal range. Agreed. There's does that neutrophils in case you wanted to see that one? Yeah. That one the neutrophil percentage, I'm not so it's it's the lymphocyte percentage I'm most interested, but platelets. K. Platelets. There we go. There we go. Alright. Flat is good. Nice. They decline during aging, two hundred and three hundred, close to optimal based on all cause mortality risk, lower than that increased risk, higher than that increased risk. So then it raises the question, where should you be two hundred and three three hundred? Should it be closer to 200? Should it be closer to 300? When considering it declines during aging, it would suggest higher maybe better in that context. But in my data, when I do biomarker versus biomarker analysis, platelets versus the other big ones, closer to 200 may be better. In your case, those stable. So we're we're all good there. If they start to decline, that's another flag, you know, or or, you know, whack a mole we've gotta try to try to cut. I know that I clot quickly, so I rarely need bandages, especially if I do the, you know, the finger prick blood test. It just clots right away. I like That's a nice thing about having high platelet counts. But Nice. I'm like a Tameritino movie where after the finger prick, I could, like, squirt that you know, squirt. Because, you know, when it comes to, was it, like, glycon age, you've gotta give so much blood on the the chart that I have to poke myself five or six times just to get that much blood out. So Are you doing so quickly. Are you doing glycan age at every test or that's just a occasional? It's it's not at every test. It is occasional. I maybe do that every six months. And then when you do glycan age, are you also measuring HbA1c on the same day? Not on the same day. No. So I'd be curious about because they're glycating different proteins. Glycan age, if I my understanding is accurate, it's it's the immunoglobulins that are glycated. Right? Or I don't know. Do you know right? Because isn't it immunoglobulins that are glycated for a glycated They're they're they're looking at glycosylation rather than glycation. So that's just it it's so it's not one glucose group. It's just a chains of glucose groups, glycosylation. Right? Yeah. And they look at different peaks, which are proprietary, so they won't tell you exactly what those peaks refer to. But the proteins that are, glycosylated, I think it's I IgG. It's not it's not albumin or hemoglobin. I believe you're correct. Yeah. Yeah. So then it makes me wonder, do we need to do glycan age? Is is HbA one c, which is like, I don't know, it's pretty cheap test, $30 test. If there's a correlation for higher HbA one c with a higher glycan age, would we need both, or is one more? It's interesting that, you know, my well, we'll look at my h b a one c. I think it I think it's been pretty decent except for one high peak at one point. But my my glycan lifestyle I they have, like, maybe four or five different categories. My lifestyle indicator, which they agree is not correctly named. They should name it something else because it's not really lifestyle. Mine has been in the high nineties, which is, like, unusually high, and it's stuck that way for years. And they can't account for it because it seems like, you know, as a biohacker, I'm doing everything right. All my other inflammation markers are low. But in working through this is where I I employ chat GPT from time to time. That particular marker looks at, if I can remember properly, I think it's called bifurcated glynaq, which is not the normal glynaq that we're used to. It's like n acetyl d glucosamine. And I do supplement with glucosamine and n acetyl glucosamine, but not I guess that's the n acetyl glucosamine is an upstream precursor of n acetyl d glucosamine, which is what they're looking at. So it's very possible that the supplementation that I'm taking is converting to this marker that they look at, and it may not be an indicator of inflammation at all in my case. So, their their science group is looking into that right now. So a higher score would be worse? Yes. Yeah. And zero is what you want, and I'm, like, high nineties. So Yeah. That's kinda like a creatine creatinine thing too. Right? So Exactly. But I just wonder if if if glycation would be similar to glycosylation in terms of correlation, or maybe they're not. You know? So I don't know. I just know that, doctor Gordon Lauck, whenever he does his talks, he's very adamant about saying this is not glycation. It's glycosylation. Mhmm. And that the two are very different. But, I mean, that's I'm taking his word for it because I don't wouldn't know either one. So And then the glycosylated, if the if it is immunoglobulins, that decreases that should decrease their function? Is that I mean, if I don't know. Because some of their markers, you want them high. Oh. And some of their markers, you want low. So it's very confusing as to when you see a score. If you're at 50%, I I guess you're golden. Right? You're, like, right in the average. But if you're looking to be optimized, some of them you wanna be really low score, some you wanna be really high score. So Yeah. I looked into glycogen age, but there most of the data that's published is from their lab, from the Lauck lab. And I'm not I'm open to it, you know, but it's, like, so such early days that even though it is associated with all cause mortality risk, I think in terms of, like, biological age or the correlation with chronological age, it was similar to, like, telomere length, which is point five or point six. It wasn't that strong relative to other tests. So I kinda crossed it off for now, but, I mean, it's an interesting idea looking at, like, protein glycosylation and, you know, associations with health related phenotypes, right, and potentially longevity. So Yeah. I think, my previous test, I was about eight years younger. This last test, I'm five years older. So, you know, it's so it varies a lot. Yeah. Yeah. But I but I do enjoy that they are willing to work with me in in learning, in teaching me, but also helping them to learn, you know, because it like you said, it is a relatively new science. So, we're we're both getting something out of the the collaboration. So Nice. I'm gonna look into them some more too, so it's good. It's kinda like looking at IOLO data. I mean, that's For you, maybe. For me, it's like, I'm looking at the matrix. You know, it's like Cypher. There's a scene where, Neo walks in on Cypher looking at the matrix, and Neo's like, you know, basically, you can read that, and Cypher says, all I see is blonde, brunette. He sees, right, the patterns and the data. So, for me, the IOLA stuff is just like that. I'm I'm working on that. I'm I'm graphing or getting ready to graph mine. I've been charting it for a long time. So, hopefully, I can maybe you can help me make sense out of it someday. I was thinking that too. Yeah. For sure. So in hot off the presses data, I haven't made the video yet, but it's on my to do list. So there's a group of metabolites in ILO's, list, lysophosphatidylcholines, and it's not all of them. It's like, LPC eighteen, eighteen one, eighteen two, and I think 23. So those are the different fatty acids that are in those metabolites. Markers of muscle mitochondrial function. So there are a bunch of studies that looked at in in vivo skeletal muscle mitochondrial function using basically, MRI through the through the through the skin. It's a pretty well well established well established technique. So, Luigi Feruchi Feruchi's group did metabolomics and then, associated these LPCs with higher mitochondrial function. So if you have higher levels, relatively higher levels, it would be indicative of, you know, big, quote, unquote, good mitochondrial function. There is a caveat there. There are studies that if it's too high, maybe bad. So, you know, it gets to the idea of what's optimal. You know what I mean? It's such cutting edge stuff that, you know, if your data is at a certain level, do you wanna push it even higher? Maybe that's not good. But within your own data, keeping that, avoiding the age related decline, They're also decreased the l those LPCs are also decreasing cancer cachexia, so which ties into decreased mitochondrial function. So Wow. Yeah. Fast, maybe. Hot off the presses. You know, that's the. Alright. So there's HSCRP, which is nice and low. Wait. Can we go to the just one point. Besides the year to year change, can we go to the trend line? Oh, sorry. Yeah. Can we there we go. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Alright. So now yeah. Can you scroll up just a little bit? Sure. There we go. Yeah. So yeah. So Look at this one point right here. I don't know what that was all about. But My gosh. I mean, people very old people have levels can have levels that high. Right? So, that's the trick. That was still in the reference range too because I you don't see the top of the reference range red line. So but scary. Yeah. Alright. So good news is you've, you know, been reducing it over time. Whereas the most recent test look like they're right outside of is that point two or point three is the upper limit? That's a great question. I mean, I can go right to the data and take a look. HSCRP. And I need to have this alphabetized better. This is like an eye chart for for me, so I can imagine what it looks like for you. Oh, here we go. Okay. So, 0.33. Oh, no. That's 2021 data. Let me scroll over. Oh, well. Silly me. My latest was, like, right here in front of my face. So 0.36 was my latest, like, 0.2, 0.24. Fantastic. That's great. That's really great. Yeah. TNF alpha looks like it's gone up a bit. Wait. Wait. Wait, Dave. That's a big one to measure. So Okay. I measured it from my last test. And so, you know, so cancer incidence increases during aging. Right? It isn't just avoid cardiovascular disease. Cancer number two. Well, in most cases, in most studies for, you know, how we're gonna die or more more most likely to die. So tumors secrete, pro inflammatory cytokines, including TNF alpha, IL six, h s CRP. So even if h s CRP is low, TNF alpha, IL six, and others could be higher. And if that trend over time so your HSCRP is good. It's going in the right direction. But TNF alpha, if that's increasing, granted it's only two data points, IL six. And this last one was in 2022, so this is quite old. So Yeah. I definitely need to do a retest. So So what I'm doing is if it's below the limit of detection, I'm not measuring it for every test eight times a year. But if it's above that, I would I'd I'd start tracking it to keep an eye on it, try to keep it as low as possible. Yeah. What is the optimal range for this? Because I don't have it's not graphing on this because my numbers are so small, I think. Yeah. As low as possible. I think the reference range is point four picograms per mil, below the limit of detection. That that would be the optimal. Okay. So then I'm higher than I wanna be for that. Based on these but it's it's just two tests. We don't know if that's representative of all data and, you know, exercise standardization. That could probably increase TNF alpha. Again, oxidized LDL, that wasn't good. But, again, no. That wasn't that wasn't too long ago. That was still 2024, though. I haven't tested that in a while. Yeah. I think the two tests that I or the three yeah. Two tests that I have for this were both done at my cardiologist's office. So So the question there would be, is it so high LDL will shift the reaction to the right more high oxidized LDL, but then if there's if your LDL levels aren't high and ox oxidative stress is high, that'll also shift the reaction to the right for high oxidized LDL. So, some of some of iolo's ratios can be used to assess, oxidative stress. So methionine methionine sulfoxide divided by methionine, cysteine divided by cysteine, nitrotyrosine divided by tyrosine. These are, these ratios are indicative of elevated oxidative stress higher levels. So, that could be something to look into. You know, is it an oxidative stress story? Is this a reduced LDL story? And then you raised a good point. Is it related to, my my exercise regimen? Because I do know, I don't know you know necessarily which day of the week I particularly do my blood testing. But when I do my blood testing I'm generally sore and I can't do a workout. So I will try to get a heavy workout in the day before often, which I'm sure is probably skewing the data for some of this stuff. Yeah. I mean, if your data is ten year younger of PhenoAge on average, and that's with doing a hard workout the day before, I wonder maybe it's fifteen years younger if you're not. Or and then what's your best data too? You know, just like longevity world cup. If your best data is 16.6, you know, maybe That was my that was my best. Yeah. But that Other points close, but that was my best one. But that's with the hard workout the day before on most days. That one may may have been may not be eight. I I wouldn't be sure on that. Yeah. But I'm gonna need to pay attention to that. Yeah. I mean, I was doing it for practical reasons. Right? I wanna be able to get a good workout in. And so if I get if I get, you know, the puncture in the arm, I I can't because I'm gonna end up with a hematoma then if I'm starting to, you know, like, move weights the next day. Oh, I I I blood test in the morning, and every every blood test day, I do my usual ninety minute workout, like, no problem. Oh, do you really? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've given myself a hematoma before by doing that. That's interesting because, there are days I might be squeezing, like, too hard. So so not necessarily hematoma, but the bruising, you know, so that's obviously not good to, you know, to but that's generally a function of how good the phlebotomist is if she's or Faye. I shouldn't say she. But if they're jamming the needle, you know, too hard that oh, god. That's like murder. I may have told you this before, but, I mean, my veins are so flat. I do a lot I do a lot of sauna, so it kinda melts away the subcutaneous fat. And it makes my arms look great. They're very, very vascular. My friends are always asking me, you know, how do you get that veiny look in your arms? I said, well, really, I I can't take credit. It's the sauna, I think, that's doing that. But it makes that, vein compressed. It just flattens the vein. And I always warn the people when they go to give me the needle that, look, you got to go in at a very steep angle. Otherwise, you're going to go straight through. And most of the young people listen to me. It's the older ladies, like the retired ladies that work at the Red Cross Center. They're always like, son, I've been drawing blood for thirty years. I think I know what I'm doing. You know? And then every single time they screw it up. They go straight through the vein, out the other side, and hematoma right away. Oh, gosh. Yeah. That's really what made me stop donating blood at the Red Cross and started donating at plasma centers because they listened to me at plasma centers. You know, they're they have an incentive to actually get the blood, where the Red Cross ladies, they don't care if they draw the blood or not. So So when they went through your vein, what happened afterwards was was, like, just profusely they're profusely apologizing? What, what happened there? No. I mean, they blame me. They blame my veins are bad. Uh-huh. So I actually have, like, if I go into the Red Cross today, they'll probably pull up my records, and they'll see all the failed attempts, which were their fault, not mine. And they say, oh, no. Yeah. We're not even gonna try to draw from you. You're undrawable. Just laugh at them because then I could just go over to the plasma center and donate just fine, and they'll pay me. So So usually vascularity is not I mean, granted, I haven't done sauna, so I don't know what effect it would have. But if you're I mean, you're super lean. So if you have, obviously for people who have more body fat, it'd be harder to find the vein, but because you're so lean and the skin covering, you know, the, the, the area is so thin, it should be easy to be vascular. It's easy to spot the vein, but because the vein is so compressed Mhmm. It's it's not, like, nice and fat like it should be because of all the subcutaneous fat that it can ride in. So it's, like, compressed between the the muscle and the skin. And so they have to hit it at a real steep angle. Yeah. And then in terms of sauna, like, wouldn't that vasodilate you? It should open up your blood vessels, not constrict them. Yeah. In the course of the sauna. But, you know, afterwards, I think after after cooling down, it sort of melts away that fat. So Yeah. By the way, I liked your idea of, building this into an application that I could sell. I think, I think I may pursue that at some point. It you're hue when you were saying how many people are gonna watch this, is it is it a handful? I wasn't thinking about that until, I was like, oh my gosh. You're blowing up on Sierra's channel. Like, it's insane. I think it's at, like, 220,000 pea, people have watched it, and she has 25,000 subscribers. So it's not her user base. It's all over the Internet. Right? So, there's a huge amount of people. I don't know if you've been paying attention to how popular your video. No. No. I haven't. So and it started off very small, and it's been growing over time. I pay attention, you know, pay attention every day. So Wow. So this is this must be why people keep telling me I need a YouTube channel. I've been saying it. You know? Everybody's been telling me. I I do intend to do one. It's just, you know, I wanna find what my particular niche is gonna be. So Even even I've seen there's there are people like, Eric Puhagen, you know, who's like this, bodybuilder like, I don't wanna say freak bodybuilder, but if he if he was here and I called him a freak bodybuilder, he'd probably think that's a compliment. Like, he has a merch brand called Psychot or something like that, psycho. Anyway, he's not literally psycho, but he's just he, he's like a barbarian throwing weights around. So he he'll just put the camera on, and there's no bells and whistles. He'll put the camera on. I may have mentioned this, you know, in one of our earlier, calls. Right? Where cam camera on in his in his garage, which is just it's not clean. He doesn't he couldn't care less. People are there to watch him and and lift and do whatever he's doing and scream like a maniac with eight hundred pound deadlifts, 330,000 subscribers. People watch. He he and that's part of the reason I'm not in some, like, fancy studio, at least not yet. Like, I think content content matters. Yeah. So even if you're just in your garage, people wanna know about your lifestyle. They wanna know about you. It doesn't have to be the the fancy, you know, bells and whistles that Brian's doing or or any of these longevity, you know, basically channels. Everything is just fancy bells and whistles and, you know, so commercial and and, corporate. Like, so Yeah. And I don't wanna just be, like, remounting a chat g p t script to people. You know? I wanna just be authentic about what I'm doing and, you know, I I'm yeah. I'll probably just be a talking head like this. So Yeah. We'll see. Yeah. We'll see. You don't have to do it. You know? It's whatever whatever makes you happy. So, red blood. I just I have no desire to be an influencer. I mean Yeah. If that makes any sense at all. It's just I just wanna live my life. But, That could be part of the attraction people have too because it's like, he's not sharing it, you know, so they wanna know. So they're, you know, even more viewing, even more tuned in. About this iron, I wanted to show you this this whole new peak right here. This was the latest blood test. Mhmm. Look how high that is compared to everything else. Yeah. So iron is a tricky one because when you think about, like, tiers, like hierarchy of health, and you put body composition, so lean mass, body fat, visceral fat, bone. Right? All of that changes during aging. Physical function, obviously, cognitive function. You know, you could throw mobility, flexibility, all of the functional related stuff at the top of the pyramid. Right? Because if you can't move, you're basically aged. But then what's under the hood? So now if you look at just like in a blood sample, right, so 45% of what's in blood are cells. So most of that being red blood almost all of it being red blood cells and then white blood cells. Alright. So now what's the other 55%? So you've got proteins, metabolites, lipids. So if you right. So those are still the big ones. Now if you distill down even further, now you've got ions, iron, calcium, potassium. But in terms of how out of whack they've consistently gotta be for the ions, everything upstream, so metabolites, proteins, cells, because they're in such higher concentrations, you know, I pay the least amount of attention to the ions, calcium, potassium, sodium, even iron. And then instead looking at things in iron's case, like ferritin, I'd I'd be more interested in ferritin levels. Yeah. We can take a look at that. Mine are typically low, but Yep. I was just gonna say I know what I did to cause this point. It's, I've been meaning to do, Julie Gibson Clark's protocol with cooking greens forever, And I did it between these these last two tests. Wow. And so I've been doing, like, you know, a little side of, like, mustard and turnip greens with my meal, throwing them in the blender with a banana, you know, grinding them, drinking them. Wonderful. Instead of doing the the crappy greens powders that I've gotten lazy and sweat swift switched over to, you know, like, the past several years. So I thought it was great to go back to real greens, but, I think I'm getting a whole heck of a lot of iron from these greens that I wasn't getting before. So So then the question is, I I know I'm hemoglobin red blood cells because if iron should be in red blood cells. Right? So it raises the question if your blood levels of iron are high, will hemoglobin correspondingly be high, or, you know, is it just not as high as it should be? Well, let's find out. We'll we'll scroll down and take a look. My total iron binding capacity. I don't know if that's interesting or not. Yeah. Hemoglobin. Hemoglobin, red blood cells. Iron saturation is declining with aging, except for this new point that's way up here. Yeah. What what did ferritin look like on that day? Okay. Let's get there. Yeah. There's my white blood cell. So I think we looked at already or did we? RBC We did for white blood cells. We oh, wait. So red blood cells hang on. Since we're there. So, yeah, so red blood cells decline during aging. So this is great news too. You've resisted that. They can be too high, because if even though they decline during aging, they they they can be too high because red blood cells carry hemoglobin. And even though hemoglobin also declines during aging, like red red red blood cells, when it gets above 16 grams per deciliter, it's associated with an increased all cause mortality risk. So for the most recent data, I'd be paying attention, even though you've basically reversed the age related trend, you've got it moving in the right direction, not not declining. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see the next data hemoglobin. I'm way out of my optimal range though. So Yeah. But let's see what hemoglobin. Let's see. That that's like the more important. That's going in the right direction also. Yeah. But you you you've got Look how low it's been, though. So, yeah, yeah, that you've got it going in the right direction in terms of resisting age related change is great news. But there's something about those last four tests that if it's above 16, that's too high. So but then again, that could be you know, and then most people say, oh, dehydration dehydration impacted my results. That's why this is high. Right? But for that to really be true, we'd have to look at everything for those four tests. And, you know, is glucose high on that test? Is bond high? Is uric acid high? Everything that could be in blood, we'd expect to be higher if the volume of blood is less because of dehydration. Makes sense. Yeah. So if this is a greens story, then it gets to the question of what's the optimal amount of greens that gets you Right. Yeah. Yeah. I was definitely overdoing it. I mean, like I said, you know, greens for smoothies that I was drinking all day, greens for dinner. I I could cut back on the greens for sure. Yeah. But I know she was saying she likes to get a pound of vegetables in a day. I was probably trying to get a pound of greens in a day, which overkill. So along those lines that I don't know if it's causation yet, but, I too have been doing a pound of greens or worked up to a pound of greens, collard greens, which I like and make a daily cook mix. And my HDL has been as low as 28 since, like, over the past ten years. And I've been slowly increasing that to the last test, which was 67, which superficially most people think, oh, higher HDL is good. You're great. What's your HDL to TG ratio? Oh, that's pretty low too. You're great. No. So HDL, 50 to 60, lowest risk, all cause mortality. And there's actually published data for once my data agrees with the published data where there's published, inverse associations for HDL with lymphocytes. So my lymphocytes for that twelve fifty seven test, also, the HDL was 67. And when I plot my data, HDL versus lymphocytes, it is indeed inverse. So in my case, what's the optimal HDL where I get my lymphocytes closest to 2,000, and it it's not 67. So the thing, the food that's most strongly one of the food that's most strongly correlated with that HDL increase are collard greens. So the test that I cut back, granted, it's not 16 ounces, 12 ounces, just, you know, 25% cut. But if that's causing, if I should expect to see HDL come down from 67 to some lower number. So greens are an all star. It's just a matter of how much. Right. So we could look forward to that in a in a future. 100%. Yeah. 100%. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. So hemoglobin alright. MCV, how about that should be down here too. K. We got hematocrit going in the right direction. MCV. Let's see what do we got here. Oh, what was this? That's MCV. Right? MCV. Yeah. So that that does increase during aging. And that's the one where we've got the roller coaster effect going on there with the, the plotting. But even though the trend line is up with the roller coaster, I mean, 90 is not as far from terrible. I mean, values MCV values increase. Well, granted, you've had a couple that are in that ballpark, but still, like, 95, a 100 centenaries can have very high levels. MCV, very big red blood cells. So that the higher end of your range is around 90. You know, good news. Now does that mean your red blood cell health would be better if it was around 84, 85, the lower end of your range versus 90? I don't know. But, you know, generally, small red blood cells are are found in youth, more likely to be found in youth, a lower MCV, more likely in youth. So to glucose, h b a one c, if you have however many data points you have, and then lipoproteins. Those are probably gonna be under metabolic health, I would imagine. Okay. There's glucose. Yeah. So pretty flat, though. I mean, I mean, it looks like your average is somewhere around 90. Most recent average is somewhere around 90, but it does Yeah. Higher than I would like. Say that again. Higher than I would like. Yes. Wait. So let's go to do you have the h b a one c in this in this, tab? That would provide more insight. Didn't we just look at that or no? Nope. Okay. There we go. Oh, h b a one c. So that's going high. Yeah. So I placed the most value on h b a one c. So, I mean, glucose can be can be impacted by lots of things. How long is their fasting window? And then, you know, the h b a one c, it's like a three month average, for, you know, glycation of hemoglobin. Right? So Yeah. Yeah. This this one to me more value than glucose being in optimal range, but then h b one c that trend. I find this fascinating because I've been avoiding sugar like the plague. So it's it's not sugar intake that's causing this. Yeah. Finding out what does it is the is the billion dollar question. Yeah. Yeah. I also have a prescription for a carbose, which I have not been taking. Mhmm. I was planning to, you know, just experiment with that as needed. Like, if I knew I was gonna go someplace where there was gonna be birthday cake or something that day, I could, you know, hit the a carbose and, you know, block that that sugar spike. But now, I mean, after looking at this, I'm considering maybe just going on it. So that's that's one one part of the equation. What about insulin? So even though a carbose will limit some of the glucose from being absorbed, it won't block all of it. IGF. Let me ask. There we go. Here's it. Yeah. So It's all place. Well, I mean, the trend I mean, yeah, there is a lot of variability there, but it's flat. So but insulin is a tricky one because, you know, so pancreatic beta cells secrete less insulin at older ages, and it's actually lowest than youth peaks about ten years later and then comes down. So inverse you for insulin. So if you had relatively low insulin, you wouldn't it'd be hard to know if or is it youthful or is it, you know, just pancreatic beta cell failure? I doubt in your case, it's pancreatic beta cell failure failure, especially since you can have values as high as five. But, yeah, figuring we've gotta figure out what we can do to bring down that h b a one c. I love how you have all this memorized. Okay. I was fascinated watching your video about this, and I thought, you know, well, yeah, maybe he kinda brushed up on it just before the video. But no. I mean, I can tell right now. You've just you've got this stuff down. Yeah. It it's not even memorized. It's just, like, I don't even try to memorize it. You know what I mean? It's like Just second nature to you. Like you said, like, looking at the matrix and being able to read what it says. Yep. 100%. And and there too, I'm still learning. You know? It's like, I'm deep into this stuff every day. I'm still learning. And then there are things that I'm like, do I really understand that as well as I do? You know? I have to it gives it gives me a double take. So Well, I mean, that's a great question to ask about any of the stuff that we we do today because we think we have an understanding of it today. And then tomorrow, they come up with some new research and new data that turns it all on its head, and we can look at it completely different. Yeah. And and I'm happy to change my mind and be wrong, but I I ultimately always try to minimize that probability. I want whatever I'm putting out there, whatever I'm saying or making videos, I want that to stand the test of time for decades so that I could be like, look. I I was saying that for thirty, forty years. Yeah. I I already you know? So whereas, you know, there's so many people that are like, oh, I used to believe this, and I believe that. It's the well, did you have the full and I don't wanna name names, but there there are a few where they've changed their stance on various things. But, anyway see, that's why I would tend to believe you because you're looking at your own blood markers. You know what moves what in what direction. You know why. So, yeah, I don't think other people are necessarily doing that. You are. Yeah. So that makes you credible. Thanks, Dave. I wouldn't say I know why. I I have a guess based on the correlations because, you know, causation would be very hard to prove. I'd have to, like if it was collard greens in HDL, I'd have to completely remove it. And then, you know, for a few tests, see where it what happened to HDL. But I I don't wanna do that. Like so all I can do, you know, is get the recipe that gets me my best data and then see what the correlation show. You know? Yeah. Greens are great. I don't wanna take them completely out of my diet. Again, that would suck. So implemented this last night too, by the way. Nice. So l d we wanted to just see LDL. Right? Yeah. Or do or APL b, would that be there? Oh, APL b? Sure. Yeah. Let's just go up and do that first. There we go. April b. Generate. Yeah. So let's see here. So what is that? '87. So it's your trend line is around average is around 87. Yeah. Way out of my optimal because there's my optimal down here. Yeah. So the optimal is a tricky one. So when I look and I mentioned this in my, most recent video, or maybe it's not out yet. I don't know. I can't remember. But, it's coming out this Sunday if I if it's not out there yet. But so APOB, the reference range is, I think it's less than $1.15. And then Quest has the reference that they use to determine that, as their reference range. And it's a study from 2004 by a, scientist named Waldius. So, you know, I'm always doing deep dives in the literature, trying to figure out what's the most recent data because, you know, the reference range is just behind the times. Like, it takes them forever to update their ranges based on the newest the newest and, you know, best literature. So Looks like life extension has it here as one zero nine. That's too high too. So so that study in 2004 was the Amoris study by Waldius, and it just so happens that I ended up finding that same study, which was a longitudinal study published in 2021. So the QUEST that QUEST used that paper from one of the earlier studies of the Amora study and following people who ended up getting cardiovascular disease in a very short time, up to 2004, but then the rest of the cohort was followed for another seventeen years. So, you know, same sample size, but a longer follow-up. And the longer follow-up tells you something about, you know, so longer follow ups are generally better than a smaller follow-up. Right? Because if more people are getting heart disease and dying within four years, then probably they were pretty sick to start with versus the longer follow-up is, you know, you've got, more likely to have people who are generally healthy, and it takes a longer time for, you know, some of that population to die off. Right? So, anyway, so the same first author, Waldius 2021, a Morris study, Waldius 2004, Quest. So Quest hadn't op updated it based on the newest available information. So from that study, they have an a beautiful plot that's in the video of, APO b levels less than 76 milligrams per deciliter, lowest risk for having a major adverse cardiovascular event. So, heart attack. I don't remember if it was nonfatal or fatal stroke and part, cardiovascular disease mortality. Now above that risk did increase. Mace risk did increase, but it was still in the quote, unquote green. So you it it isn't just less than seventy six. The the higher end of the quote, unquote green range according to them could be, like, ninety two milligrams per deciliter, but the lowest risk was less than 76. So that that's what I'm shooting for. So now now you got me curious why I have my, optimal where it is. So let's see. We were just looking at APOB. Let me come back. Reference table. I wanna see why I set it where I did. Probably Peter. Peter Attia is always talking about, like Life life extension said, like, less than 80, less than 60 optimal. My cardiologist said less than 70. I don't know why I have set I do. That's interesting. I have a set between 52 and 60. So normally, I would have my reasoning in here, and it's missing. So So I I remember you sent me some data where I think you had some small amount of plaque or something along those lines. So in that case, as low as physically possible, I mean, you know, sure, less than 76. But in your, you know, in your case, having some preexisting plaque, I mean, less than 50, whatever the lowest you can get to. But this was so specific, 52 to 60. I don't know why I came up with that. I I got that from somewhere. I just don't know where. No. That's interesting. Oh, well. Okay. HDL. I quit scrolling past it. There we go. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Nice. So '58 is most recent data. Trend line up. HDL can decline during aging. I mean, it peaks in youth, and then it comes down in men and then basically stays flat in the low fifties. So, yeah, you've resisted that. That's good news. Yeah. I I've set all of these, yeah, based on my my age. So, like, from from 60 on, what does it do? That's what you see here. So this wouldn't be the same for somebody that's, you know, 50 or 40 or 30. Gotcha. Yeah. So the big question here is what two did you do to get your HDL going in the right direction from low, you know, high forties to, you know, high fifties. Yeah. Right. Right offhand, I can't tell you. I don't know. I'd have to go back and take a look. Yeah. Trichlides? Okay. They're actually nice and low. Yeah. It should be. Oh, you've got PSA there too. Oh, yeah. But we can come back. Triglycerides, HCL ratio. I got, so here's my type, triglycerides. Okay. So, it could be better. So less than 45, that's associated with lowest heart disease mortality risk. So that's the ideal. I'm not even there yet. I mean but looks like yours are around 60, somewhere around 60. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty good. That's pretty pretty pretty good. Trending up? Yeah. I mean, very, very mildly. I mean, you know It's a mild slope. Yeah. So then the I guess alright. So then l lipoprotein a, are you measuring lipoprotein a? Trying to figure out why your APO b would be a bit higher, closer to 80. Triglycerides continue contribute to APO b, but then, obviously, LDL, lipop lipoprotein a. Yeah. I don't do that very often either. Yeah. But interestingly, in your case, there's a wide range. For most people, it's pretty pretty tight. And, genetically, I put that in quotes, genetically limited, but you can see yours have ranged from 15 to double that, you know, 33. Yeah. That's that's why I typically don't do it because they tell you that it stays pretty flat or pretty consistent. So that's why I haven't tested it. But I can see in my case, it's not very consistent. Yeah. So I'm I I can't figure out if I should only focus on APO b or lipoprotein a because there is some published data suggesting it is more atherogenic than LDL. So does that mean I should be trying to reduce lipoprotein a and APO b? But if I reduce APO b and lipoprotein a is a bit higher than it should be, does it matter? I can't I still don't have a definitive answer on that. So I'm assuming mine is based on my meat consumption. What do you think about that? So in my key I can in my case, I don't eat meat that often even though I have fish and yogurt every day. So, it's a higher fat intake in my data. I've been able to cut lipoprotein a in half over the past, you know, ten years or so from my highest level. But but By doing what? Just limiting Higher fat. Higher fat diet. Higher fat. Okay. Yeah. But even there, there's a a u shape because if I go too high for fat intake, all the biomarkers start going way too high. Red blood cells go even higher. Hemoglobin goes towards closer to 16. So, you know, I don't wanna optimize lipoprotein a and then send the glucose goes up. So I don't wanna send everything else in the wrong direction. So it's, you know, how much fat can I tolerate my body tolerate before I'm messing up the other stuff? So what kind of stuff are you doing? Avocados and not avocados, but just mostly nuts, like, almonds, walnuts, peanuts, Brazil nuts, occasionally cashews, occasionally sunflower seeds. But the core is like almonds, peanuts, walnuts. Yeah. See, my diet is really high in in nuts and avocado and yeah. So I'm getting a lot of fat. Yeah. Would you know what the approximate like, how much of the percentage of calories of from fat would be your diet composition? Oh, no. There was a time when I was, I was using I think it was called Nutrisense. I think it was it it was one of the, CGMs that I was using that I I was putting all my food in and and looking at it. And, that was years ago, and I I now I couldn't tell you. I have no idea. Yeah. Probably need to do that again. Yeah. Definitely. Definitely. Alright. Wait. So, LDL. Okay. LDL. Trying to figure out where the higher than it should be, APOB, it's not coming from triglycerides, so VLDL because your triglycerides are relatively low. Yeah. You've got some room to move down in LDL. And so LDL, probably the most, you know, the most, controversial these days. Right? You know, you have people who post The main match hyper responders and all that stuff. But that's a whole different category. You know what I mean? Like, that's eating no carbs for you know? I don't even wanna wade into those waters. You know? It's, it's a whole different a whole different scenario. Right? So but in the average population, there are conflicting epidemiological studies. Do you want your LDL to be closer to, like you know, some studies suggest even one ninety, one eighty is associated with lowest risk. But so l d LDL follows an inverse u during aging. Low in youth, also low in advanced age. So there too, it's like, how would you know if you're youthful or centenarian levels where they're both very low? Right? So, and then when you consider that there are studies in 80 year olds that have higher LDL, higher total cholesterol, and they have lower all cause mortality risk relative to people who have lower LDL, well, LDL declines towards the end of life. And, actually, that's another video I've got in progress where, cancer cachexia, lower LDL, and cancer incidence increases during aging. So Oh. If someone's got on even undiagnosed cancer, I'd bet that their LDL is declining for a long time, and they may not even know it. So yeah. So, anyway, so when considering that, you've got epidemiological studies that haven't adjusted their models for all of the factors that can impact the association for LDL with heart disease or all cause mortality risk. Like, they'll look at the standards, age, sex, BMI, preexisting CBD, but rarely, they'll include cancer or liver disease, which can impact LDL. LDL, you know, cholesterol is made by the the lipoproteins are made by the liver. So if you have liver disease as an advanced stage, you'd be less likely to be even put it out into the blood. So, anyway, there's one study that looked at four point seven million people that adjusted for all of that. Cancer cancer diagnosis, CBD, the standards, age, sex, BMI, dementia, liver disease, kidney disease. Like, it was, like, 11 comorbidities. And when they did that, you know, the the, you know, basically, higher is better LDL in association with lowest all cause mortality risk. No. It's not that's not true anymore. And then the optimal range for CHD mortality risk is sixty five to one twenty. So even though technically and that might be where your green air green lines are from. I don't know. Could be? Alright. Let's let's see if I actually have some, some reasoning for that recorded here. So we're looking for I'm sorry. Were we just looking at LDL? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So LDL right there. And then just come over here. And, okay, I've got lots it's lots of different reasoning. Some of this was probably taken right out of your video. Yeah. Inverse u. I see that. Yeah. So I got the lowest ACM, one thirty to one eighty. Since 01/20 is significant CVS CHD risk. I was setting my high end to one twenty. Yeah. But we're considering you There we go. I got your name right here. Yeah. I believe that you That that's that's great, Dave. But you've got the the earlier data that didn't adjust for all of the factors that can impact the association for LDL with all cause mortality, where where LDL was one thirty to one eighty lowest risk unless it unless it says, but but not adjusted for all comorbidities. Yeah. Alright. No worries. So so, anyway, that's where I think a lot of the and I'll probably make a video on this at some point just, you know, probably life fires. People are gonna be yelling at me in the comments, but the data is what it is. So but knowing that you have some was it coronary artery calcium, or was it soft plaque? I don't remember in your case. I had, yeah, I could I could probably pull that up. The I mean, the visuals, I think, are probably better than anything. So you can see the very little bits of plaque built up here. Yeah. And that's that's the, so I've got calcified versus non calcified shown here. So you I mean, you do have some minor plaque. Right? So then the question is, does reducing APL b to its lowest level, does that help slow the increase rate of increase over time? Yeah. And all this was new as of in the past few years because I did a, coronary calcium CT, about roughly five years ago. And I was, I would say it was about maybe zero, I think, is what it was. And now, I actually had a score, which scared me because that was a big change, I thought, within the last five years. But still super, super low. Right? It's still low. It's just not as low as I would have liked it to have been. Yeah. Zero is what I would have liked it to have been. So So then the question is if you can reduce APOB to, you know, fifty, sixty versus 80, you know, will that slow the progression? That's the biggest. Right? That's the question. Yeah. Oh, PSA. PSA is a big one too. On the rise. Yeah. We gotta flip that. We gotta reverse that trend quick. Yeah. And and that's another reason I'd suggest, you know, the t and f alpha and IL six, because, you know, if PSA is increasing because there is some some small cancerous thing growing, If the pro inflammatory cytokines are increasing over time too, that's another signal that something is going on. We wanna get on top of, you know, faster, sooner than later. Absolutely. PSA free, same. Wait. We can even look at the doubling time for the for your total PSA, not the free, but if you go up to the total. Back to total again? Yeah. So you had values let's see. The trend line is, like, point eight, and then it's, yeah, about double. So that's about double over the past five years. I don't know how I'd I'd have to look that up. Not an expert on PSA even though I'm familiar and have looked at optimal ranges. But, I mean, values as low as point three are found in youth, so that would be my target. But the five year doubling time, I mean, yours essentially have doubled on average, five years based on the trend line. So I'd have to look that up and see, like, risk based on and how long should it take the double? Should it be thirty years, fifty? I don't know. I just don't know what that is. That would be interesting to know. Keep me posted. Yeah. So, yeah, PSA free. Percent PSA declining. Yeah. Yeah. Coming in the wrong direction. Yeah. That is in the wrong direction. I looked that up the other day. It is going in the wrong direction, but it's still relatively high. I think if I remember correctly, like, PSA free, percent free being, like, less than 15% or less than 10% was associated with an increased risk of, prostate cancer. So, I mean, yours? Yeah. This right here is the high mark of my optimal, so I'm quite a bit higher than optimal. Yeah. I I'd have to look that up, though. I I don't wanna confuse it. You know? That one is not as memorized. It's, still fresh because it's so new. Alright. Testosterone gradually declines with aging. Mine's been increasing. Resisted it. Yeah. So that's another interesting one because had you haven't gotten leaner over the past four years. Right? No. So testosterone's associated with BMI. Leaner BMI is higher testosterone, and then as BMI increases, testosterone levels drop. So that you haven't gotten leaner, it suggests there's stuff you've added in or or are doing that, has potentially helped you resist, right, age related decline. I mean, I've heard it claimed that you can't take supplements and increase your testosterone. I I think that's wrong. I've actually seen it. I've also seen it in when I run. It seems like when I run, my testosterone increases in in along with the miles that I put in. So, I mean so my message to a lot of guys out there, instead of just jumping straight to TRT, try you know, get up and take a run sometimes. You know? Just go get physical. You know? Don't it just don't sit so long because that'll drive your t low. Yeah. Or it could be that you've got, you know, you know, conqueror genetics where the more effective you are, that's good for your testosterone. You know? So I would be curious to see that. I don't know if they've identified those genes yet, have they? Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. Alright. Wait. So free testosterone? Okay. Yeah. So now that's oh, that's terrible. My free testosterone has been quite low because my sex hore hormone binding globulin is pretty high. Yeah. So that's a tricky one. I'm in the same boat. I don't know. So same boat with SHBG being high. And they're just there there are published studies on free tea and all cause mortality risk. But, on the other hand, like, Luigi Fontana studies like calorie restriction, free tea levels drop. And part of his rationale for lower androgen levels in people on CR is that, that may be part of the anticancer or reduced cancer risk in calorie restricted animals, so maybe that translates into people. I don't know if that's true. And then SHBG is a tricky one because CR increases it dramatically. Exercise increases it, but not as much as CR. So that's, you know, your super exercises, so that's probably a a component of why yours, you know, maybe higher than most. But on the other side of that, s SHBG increases during aging. So there's also something besides, you know, exercising and calorie restriction super high, And then it just increases over over time for the average population who's not in that boat, which also that is associated with increased Alzheimer's incidence and, metabolic syndrome. So how can those two do things? How do you square that circle where? I don't know. I I've actually had people tell me that the fact that I'm low in free testosterone is not necessarily a bad thing. Yep. Their way of looking at it was that just means that maybe your cells are uptaking more of it. So it's just not free floating in your serum. Yeah. Which I mean, if that's the case, that would be a good thing. I just don't know how you would measure such a thing. Yeah. So Oh, wait. So SHBG, let's take a look at that. I could keep scrolling down. I know it's in here. Oh, pregnant alone. There's my DHT. So that's going in the well, it's going in the wrong direction for aging, but at least it's to me, it's going in the right direction because it's heading toward my optimal. Yeah. And I like it low to keep the hair thick. So I'm I'm doing things to try to drive DHT down too. So Nice. My estradiol, which has been quite high at times, same with total estrogens. Only because I'm, you know, I'm supplementing with pregnenolone and DHEA, which are upstream precursors of both testosterone and estrogen. So to get that high testosterone, I'm gonna get high estrogen right along with it. There's just no, there's no no getting one without the other. But then I'm taking things like, calcium d glucarate and dim to try to bind with the estrogens to move them out. Although, you know, estrogens aren't necessarily a bad thing either. Like, what? Seventeen estradiol is a good thing for men, but you can't really be picky with dim and and calcium to glucarate. They just bind to all of it, not the ones you want. Gotcha. Yeah. So here we go. Here's the actual one. Not terribly high. I mean Yeah. Higher than I want because this is my here's my green optimal down here. Now I'm now I'm outside of the reference range. Yeah. But, I mean, like I said, when considering that vigorous exercise or active people, relatively high VO two maxes have values approximately double the reference range, and then people on CR fourfold higher than, you know or not the reference range, but, like, one twenty versus, you know, exercises, I think, if I remember correctly in the paper, it's, like, sixty sixty to 70 for people who are fit and active. So, yeah, I wouldn't I wouldn't I'm not too worried about SHBG. The thing is there's a biological age clock that includes it so that and it's that clock is as good as pheno age, but just it includes some different markers like SHBG. So that'd be one where I would look older. But is it though is it though really? Right? Because if it's coming from CR and exercise. I'm not familiar with that clock. I would love to play with that. What how do I get a hold of that one? It's, longevitytools. If you type in longevitytools.com or in Google. Okay. Yeah. I'll do that. Or longevity I can almost guarantee you I'm gonna be watching over, you know, both parts of this video myself and and taking notes since I haven't been doing that while we've been talking. Nice. So are there biomarkers we didn't cover that you wanna cover? Yeah. I'm gonna cover anything you wanna see. I don't know what else we've got. Mitochondrial health. Have we done anything there? Not yet, but wait, you know what we could do for another one? I don't know how many of these you want to do, but HRV resting heart rate, we can go through that in another video. We could go through all the data, all the data in another video. I mean, epigenetic. Yeah. We yeah. We could definitely go over all my true diagnostic data. That's all over the place. Mhmm. Especially since I I told you I tested, what, four or five times all last year, every time after a bad, you know, life influence just because I wanted to see what it would do. And so I've got some, you know, pretty nasty looking data there, so that could be fun. Yeah. The I I'm not worried about the epigenetics so much. For me, I wanna I want the biomarkers that they're based on. So, you know, didn't even paste we may have mentioned I may have mentioned it right where it's got, I think, 18 biomarkers. VO two max is one of them, waist to hip ratio, h b a one c, CRP, h to CRP. Gum health is a big one there too, which is included. Have you looked at any of your raw data for true diagnostic? Yeah. So so, I don't wanna give too much of it away before, you know, before the ice cream if ice cream cake comes, but, yeah, somebody reached out to me and and is looking at the I can't do any of it. I don't have that expertise. So he's looked at the raw data. What I'm act actually wanna do is so remember I was saying about GrimAge being associated or the strongest predictor of all cause mortality risk based on epigenetics. So I I asked him if it's possible to identify the CPGs, the methylation sites, if if if, he could identify which of those sites in GrimAge, in my case, were the worst. And then can we identify which proteins, that those were derived from? Right? So is it is it cystatin c? And I have hyper or hypomethylation, and that suggests my cystatin c level should be optimized and then have a lower grim age. So I don't know if that will yield any fruit. Maybe it will, but that's how I see the epigenetics. Can I identify can I use their data to identify real biomarkers and then go for the biomarkers instead? Interesting. Yeah. I I was driving Ryan crazy because he was being very generous, and he was taking some time to walk me through my my raw data. And, I I don't think he was prepared for the the amount of questions that I had. I I think he might have thought I was just like a regular consumer, and I was just good. My eyes were gonna glaze over. Well, they did. My eyes still did glaze over because a lot of it was way over my head. But I I really did try to hang in there, and then I had all kinds of questions for him. Some things I I I couldn't make sense of by the way they the report was because they might have had the same thing listed maybe eight different times with eight different values. And I think, I may have the terminology incorrect, but I guess there's different isomers of those particular items. And, yeah, they didn't label them with, like, you know, dash one, dash two, dash three. So I I didn't know which isomer was what, so I couldn't make any sense of that. And yeah. So it was it was very confusing. So that was the raw data you were digging into the The raw data. Yeah. So what were you trying to get out of the raw data? I I was just trying to make sense of it. I wanted to try to see, like, you know, what is it they're looking at specifically? And, I went to the human metabolome database, and I was cross referencing all those. I did the same thing with iolo data. You know, I wanted to see exactly what proteins they were looking at, you know, what metabolites. And then if I had a clue which things were, you know, the the biggest drivers, then maybe I would have a clue what I could change in my my diet or my lifestyle to move those. Because I mean, right now, they don't offer a whole lot of support in how to change your methylation status. Right? They just give you the the data and basically don't smoke, exercise, get lots of sleep, but, you know, there's there's gotta be more to it than that. And you're already doing all of those things, eat real food, exercise, like, they're like you said, there are levels that that if you're able to, write the code where you could take the raw data and identify, like, even if it's the need and pace, identify the methylation sites that are contributing to an a higher or faster rate of aging. That'd be something that I think you'd be able to market to them or your own your own tool where people enter the raw they take the their data, they bring it to you, and they use to see where the weak spots are. Then we send them over to my app, and then, they put in their diet data and everything else, and we give them what potentially could improve those things. Right? So Yeah. It's kind of what I was hoping to get out of it, but I know at some point we're crossing into, proprietary, you know, information. So they're they're not really gonna be willing to share everything under the kimono. But But if it's your raw data, I mean you know Yeah. Oh, yeah. My raw data. Sure. Yeah. Is is do you see in their raw data, like, is it labeled? I don't I don't know. I haven't looked at it, but, like, you know, it'd be great if they had it separated for, like, you know, Dunedin PACE, like cardio respiratory fitness. These are all the CPGs that are related to that. Like, if they had all the biomarkers that the CPGs are based on, and then you could go for it like that. But I'm guessing it's not organized like that at all. No. In fact, I, you know, I can pull that up if you wanna look at it. It's really not a for consumer Yeah. Report. It's just, it it's something probably they're beta testing as far as just throwing it into a report format. They originally sent me accidentally sent me the, the assay data. And I I pulled up, Genome Studio because I wanted to be able to pull in the, I think in their case, it's Lumina. I'm not I can't remember which lab now. I wanted to be able to just pull in that raw data that they gave me and be able to view it, but, I could not get it to load in Genome Studio to save my life. Oh. And, when I mentioned this to Ryan, he sort of laughed. He's like, yeah. That that would be very difficult to do, and he just because I I guess I'm such a noob, he, he found that humorous that I was even trying. So must must be something really silly that I was not understanding that made him chuckle. But Mhmm. Hopefully, he'll we'll have another call at some point, and he'll be able to explain it to me. But yeah, I mean, I can I can pull it up and show it to you? Maybe you'll understand why I was so confused. Yeah. So let me get there. I mean, unless you wanna do that in another, call. But Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I well, I've got two and a half hours of content. I'm gonna have to cut it to clips, and it's gonna take me a while. Sorry about that. Yeah. I can Oh, no. It's great. Find and do go on forever with this stuff. So Same. Yeah. I appreciate it. It's great. Thanks, Dave. No problem. Yeah. Alright. So, I guess we'll wrap it up. Right? So so thanks again, Dave. I appreciate you sharing all of your data or almost all of your data. Almost done. We're getting here. We're getting there. Yeah. So we've got what? Epigenetics we can go through, I guess, with iolo, you have one test or how many tests? Oh, no. Maybe have, like, four. Oh, wow. Maybe five. So are you plotting it, like, the 600 I I actually haven't plotted it yet. It's usually, kinda like I was doing it the same way I was doing it with, my blood marker data prior to plotting it. I would just look at what changed from time to time and how that affected my score overall trying to make sense. Yeah. And now I think we'll plot it. But not all of it. I don't know that all of it. I mean, so the way it's, but not all of it would be meaningful. I think it can be, but separating it into groups, like for example, there are like 300 triglycerides. I mean, but they don't all go in the same direction. You know? Some you want a little bit higher and some you want lower. Same thing for the diglycerides. Well, granted, there are more. Anyway, so, the age related trends are interesting, but you'd have to know what it it it's so tricky for for a lot of those metabolites to know directionality. You know? So Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. And so not gonna be anything to me, but it would to you. So Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So the biggest one off the top of my head, kind of urine divided by tryptophan. Oh, yeah. We did talk about that one previously. Yeah. I I tracked that in a separate tab. So, you know, that'd be the one of the first ones I'd wanna see where your data is and avoiding that from increasing during aging. I think that was one the one I was able to recognize because I think they called it out in, one of my first reports. And so that I've been watching that ever since. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Alright, David. I signed up I signed up to this, subscription plan, so I'm getting it, like, probably every quarter now. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. We can go on forever. So alright, my friend. Talk to you soon. Thank Thank you, my friend. This was fun. No. Thank you. Ciao. Ciao. Bye.
