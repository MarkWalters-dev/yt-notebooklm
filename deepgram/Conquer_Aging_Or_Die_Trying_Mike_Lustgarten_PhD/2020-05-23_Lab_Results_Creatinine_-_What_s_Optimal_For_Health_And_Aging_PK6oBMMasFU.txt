Creatinine also increases with aging, which is associated with a higher all cause mortality risk. So there weren't any good pictures for how creatinine changes during aging, but in this study of 9,000 people, again, Morgan Levine's group, they found increases. And all the studies have found increases for creatinine during aging, even less directly, but, relatedly, creatinine is a measure of kidney function. So, kidney function is estimated with the glomerular filtration rate, eGFR. So because creatinine is a component of that, eGFR as a measure of kidney function declines with data. There's plenty of data showing eGFR as estimated with creatinine levels, decline with aging. So that so it's pretty well established that creatinine increases with aging as a long story short. So what about risk of death for all causes? So in a study of 30,000 or 30 around 31,000 subjects, looking at, risk of death for all causes here, versus a creatinine level. Even though the the reference range is somewhat wide, the, mortality risk is, is actually with, a lower within a more narrow range. So what we can see is is lowest risk is about zero point eight milligrams per deciliter. But as you go below that, risk, increases. And as you go above that, risk increases. But when risk fall falls below one, that's considered to be reducing risk. So within that range, it's 0.6 to zero, one point one milligrams per decimeter, which is still a tighter range, than or or more, you know, yeah. It's a tighter range in the reference range. So resisting the age related increase for creatinine. So, pre tracking values, my diet, my average value over eight measurements, in my thirties was 1.11. And I've actually reduced that, over the last five years, whereas creatinine, as I mentioned, increases during aging. And, again, these two groups of data are significantly different. So, whereas there was more variability in my data, just as another, illustration of why more data is better, you know, there's more variability when I was tracking less often, but you can see the data is more tight. There's less range. And one component of that may be, you know, dietary tracking too. So but I just wanna I just popped the arrow up because in my last few measurements, I've been kinda playing with my diet looking to optimize my biomarkers, and you can see that my creatinine levels increased. So, in addition to tracking, you know, the macro and micronutrients, I also track food intake, but I haven't done that, for the whole five year period. I've just been doing that for the past a year and a half or so, so I have less data for it. But within that data, I think this is nine data points, three, six. Yeah. So nine data points, for, creatinine levels with my daily, average daily intake of eggs and cheese. I don't need it every day, but it's the average amount, every day. And, actually, there was a time when I increased it to see how it would affect my biomarkers. So what we see is as my intake of eggs and cheese increased, my creatinine levels went up, which is going in the wrong direction. So with that in mind, I've cut back on my, egg and cheese intake, and that actually resulted in, bringing my creatinine levels back down. So, for whatever reason, whether it's acid load or too much animal protein or or what, eating I I I limit how much of of the egg and and cheese that I take in to keep my creatinine levels from, going up. So, just to illustrate so by tracking from all this data so far, by tracking daily diet circulating biomarkers, you can identify the dietary pattern to leads that leads to the best biomarker profile for you.
