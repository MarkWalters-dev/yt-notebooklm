The glucose h b a one c, if you have how however many data points you have, and then lipoproteins. Those are probably gonna be under metabolic health, I would imagine. Okay. There's glucose. Yeah. So pretty flat, though. I mean, I mean, it looks like your average is somewhere around 90. Most recent average is somewhere around 90, but it does Yeah. Higher than I would like. Say that again? Higher than I would like. Yes. Wait. So let's go to do you have h b a one c in this in this, tab? That would provide more insight. Didn't we just look at that or no? Nope. Okay. There we go. Oh, h b o n c. So that's going high. Yeah. So I placed the most value on h b a one c. So, I mean, glucose can be can be impacted by lots of things. How long is their fasting window? And then, you know, the h b a one c, it's like a three month average, for, you know, glycation of hemoglobin. Right? So Yeah. Yeah. This this one to me more value than glucose being in optimal range, but then h b a one c, that trend. I find this fascinating because I've been avoiding sugar like the plague. So it's it's not sugar intake that's causing this. Yep. Finding out what does it is the is the billion dollar question. Yeah. Yeah. I also have a prescription for a carbose, which I have not been taking. Mhmm. I was planning to, you know, just experiment with that as needed. Like, if I knew I was gonna go someplace where there was gonna be birthday cake or something that day, I could, you know, hit the a carbox and, you know, blunt that that sugar spike. But now, I mean, after looking at this, I'm considering maybe just going on it. So that that's one one part of the equation. What about insulin? So even though a carbose will limit some of the glucose from being absorbed, it won't block all of it. I guess. Let me go. There we go. Here's the So It's all place. Well, I mean, the trend I mean, yeah, there is a lot of variability there, but it's flat. So but insulin is a tricky one because, you know, so pancreatic beta cells secrete less insulin at older ages, and it's actually lowest in youth peaks about ten years later and then comes down. So inverse u for insulin. So if you had relatively low insulin, you wouldn't it'd be hard to know if or is it youthful or is it, you know, just pancreatic beta cell failure? I doubt in your case, it's pancreatic beta cell failure failure, especially since you can have values as high as five. But, yeah, figuring we've gotta figure out what we can do to bring down that h p a one c. I love how you have all this memorized. I was fascinated watching your video about this, and I thought, you know, well, yeah, maybe he kinda brushed up on it just before the video. But no. I mean, I can tell right now. You've just you've got this stuff down. Yeah. It it's not even memorized. It's just like I don't even try to memorize it. You know what I mean? It's like Just second nature to you. Like you said, like, looking at the matrix and being able to read what it says. Yep. 100%. And and there too, I'm still learning. You know? It's like, up deep into this stuff every day, I'm still learning. And then there are things that I'm like, do I really understand that as well as I do? You know? I have it gives it gives me a double take. So Well, Well, I mean, that's a great question to ask about any of the stuff that we we do today because we think we have an understanding of it today, and then tomorrow, they come up with some new research and new data that turns it all on its head, and we can look at it completely different. Yeah. And and I'm happy to change my mind and be wrong, but I I ultimately always try to minimize that probability. I want whatever I'm putting out there, whatever I'm saying or making videos, I want that to stand the test of time for decades so that I could be like, look. I I was saying that for thirty, forty years. Yeah. I I already you know? So whereas, you know, there's so many people that are like, oh, I used to believe this, and now I believe that. It's the well, did you have the full and I don't wanna name names, but there there are a few where they've changed their stance on various things. But, anyway see, that's why I would tend to believe you because you're looking at your own blood markers. You know what moves what in what direction. You know why. So, yeah, I don't think other people are necessarily doing that. You are. Yeah. So that makes you credible. Thanks, Dave. I wouldn't say I know why. I I have a guess based on the correlations because, you know, causation would be very hard to prove. I'd have to, like if it was collard greens in HDL, I'd have to completely remove it. And then, you know, for a few tests, see where it what happened to HDL. But I I don't wanna do that. Like so all I can do, you know, is get the recipe that gets me my best data and then see what the correlation show. You know? Yeah. Greens are great. I don't wanna take them completely out of my diet. Again, that would suck. So
