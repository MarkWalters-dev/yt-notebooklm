When you look at Glenn Jeffrey and his lab, what he is finding out and he sees this not just in humans. What he this phenomenon that I'm about to explain to you is not specific to just humans. It's it's also seen in bees. It's seen in fruit flies. I mean, it's seen up and down across species, and that is this thing. This thing thing called the biphasic response of light, which is that it takes a certain amount of time for light to make its effect on the mitochondria. And what he's seeing is about fifteen to twenty minutes is what he sees. And then further exposure to light after that has diminishing marginal utility.
