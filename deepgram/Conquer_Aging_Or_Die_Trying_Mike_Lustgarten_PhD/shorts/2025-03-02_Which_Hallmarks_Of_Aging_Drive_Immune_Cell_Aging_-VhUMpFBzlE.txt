The lab is trying to look at which sort of pillars of aging, you know, can drive this systemic aging if we say we cause DNA damage or we impair proteostasis or mitochondrial function in immune cells. What happens? And does it happen at the same sort of strength and same timing? Or because it would sort of tell us which pillar of aging might sort of have primacy in the whole development of immune aging. And we're trying to create reporter models that would allow us to track things like senescence, autophagy, and maybe DNA damage all at the same time and just watch the immune system longitudinally as that mouse ages out and see how these things all change in relation to each other. Because I think we sort of we're really good at studying one hallmark of aging at a time. I don't think we're so great at sort of studying them comprehensively and the integrated changes across them. And I'm hoping that we can sort of create some tools that will help the, you know, the field to do some of that.
