Would like to mention a study that was done last year, in Wuhan in China where they measure the bacteria profile and saliva from patient with Alzheimer disease. These patients, they don't have any comorbidities. Only they suffer from Alzheimer disease. And they were able to show that, they have the same trends that we show. Like, the bacteria, the bad bacteria that they are increasing with Alzheimer disease and the beneficial bacteria are decreasing with Alzheimer disease. Now what I wanna say is, comorbidities, of course, it can affect maybe it can bypass, the oral health, but, of course, it's bidirectional. So if you have oral, health disease, this can lead, for example, to hypertension. It can lead to diabetes. Also, hypertension and, diabetes itself, they can lead to what? They can lead to, oral health, issues. So in order to, like, just separate between both, in human is difficult because you cannot manipulate, like, for ethical reasons. You can mani you cannot manipulate it manipulate it in human.
