The biology behind the lung and the gut is super duper fascinating. Earlier, I made the comment about, like, how only 1% of your immune cells are in your blood. Well, most of them are in your gut. Like, that's where if you if you wanted to draw a picture of the immune system, that's where you what you should really draw because just the incredible amount of capacity it takes to maintain the gut microbiota and the integrity of the gut requires so much work. And so there's some cool studies in influenza basically saying, like, a lot of times, like, clinically, if someone's really, like, really ill for any respiratory infection, but influenza definitely being one of them, they have diarrhea. So why do they have diarrhea? Well, it's because all those immune cells that need to be in the gut have to hightail it to the lung to help deal with that. And so now you have this period this point of vulnerability in the gut as well. So I think that whole gut lung health access is super interesting.
