In cell culture, high levels of urea degrade tight junctions. So in the intestine, you have you know, it's a tube, and then you have intestinal epithelial cells, basically, that make the inside of that tube. Those epithelial cells are connected by tight junctions. So if you have high circulating levels of urea in blood, the intestine is is it gets a blood supply. Urea can degrade those tight junctions, making it easier for stuff inside the intestinal lumen, poop, microbes, microbial products, whatever it may be, to leak into the blood and activate the immune system.
