These tend to exist in developed societies. Like, they tend not to have a certain bacterial species called Bifidobacterium longum infantis in their guts. This bug is is has essentially evolved to just consume all the sugars in breast milk. Right? But, you know, it's babies that gets breast milk, should be able to consume those sugars based on the having this bacteria in their gut. But if you're missing bifida bacteria, can't digest the breast milk properly, and you don't get all the benefits of that breast milk. Where did this bug go? Why is it not present in our societies? We definitely know it was there in the nineteen twenties and nineteen thirties because we have records of people culturing it out of store, but it's now its prevalence has dropped to virtually zero or very, very small numbers, maybe ten percent of our population. We think that's due to multigenerational antibiotic use and poor diet leading to, you know, mothers and their daughters and their daughters' daughters not having those bacteria present inside their guts and therefore not able to pass it on to the children.
