So to put your the IgG data into perspective, IgG levels in blood are about a thousand milligrams per deciliter. So this is one of the biggest trees in the blood force. Glucose, for example, in youth is eighty eighty milligrams per deciliter. So we have IGG at a thousand, and a thousand maybe, even an average or the median value milligrams per deciliter. You have glucose at 80. Already, it's one of the biggest trees because it's 12 times higher than glucose. Okay. So now total cholesterol. Total cholesterol, let's say, 200 milligrams per deciliter. IgG in just the average or median values without assuming aging or obesity. A thousand versus 200 is a fivefold higher amount of IgG just than the normal state. So in terms of its it being one of the biggest trees in the forest and not talked about in terms of glucose or lipoproteins, which are the dominant theme in health and health span, I think you're onto something fantastic.
