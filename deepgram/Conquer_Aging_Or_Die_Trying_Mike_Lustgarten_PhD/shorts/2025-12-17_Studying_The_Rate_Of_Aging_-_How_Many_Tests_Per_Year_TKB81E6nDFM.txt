Single time point measurements, which are important. But, you know, when we're talking about aging rate, and I think a lot of people lose sight of this is they'll only measure, like, once. You know, maybe once a year, once every couple years, whenever infrequently. Right? So is one measurement representative of a full year average? Like, you know, for the sports players, if I'm a baseball player and I hit four home runs in one day and then no home runs the rest of the year, am I the world's best baseball player or maybe just on that day?
