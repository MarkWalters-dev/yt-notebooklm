Say, a great immunologist. Yehuda Yehuda Schonfeld who said that all diseases are autoimmune in nature until proven otherwise. I sort of wanna coop the statement and say, aging is largely based on immune dysfunction until proven otherwise to some degree too. Right? Like, sort of coop that. And so I think a lot of these Jira Therapeutics are probably doing some benefit to the immune system. We just haven't rigorously tested it yet.
