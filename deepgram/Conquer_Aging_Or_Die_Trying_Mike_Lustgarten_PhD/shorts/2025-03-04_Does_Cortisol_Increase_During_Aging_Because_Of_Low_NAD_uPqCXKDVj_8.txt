I think NAD is obviously important. Clients during aging, it's in the mitochondria. If you don't have optimal NAD levels, you're gonna have decreased mitochondrial function, less energy production, and that's a potential disaster for aging. Right? So but I'm still trying to, you know, so because I'm measuring NAD at every blood test, I'm doing biomarker versus biomarker analysis, you know, NAD versus, you know, albumin and glucose, and I don't see anything major. I mean, I do see higher NAD, lower LDL, which, okay, maybe a small decrease in cardiovascular disease risk. But even I'm even doing metabolomics where I'm looking at 600 metabolites trying to get more insight into pathways, you know, as to what could be optimized. And there may be some value. I don't know if you've thought about this, but, you know, cortisol levels increase during aging, and the conversion of cortisol into cortisone requires NAD. So if NAD levels decline during aging, you'll have a buildup of cortisol because it can't be converted into cortisone. So I actually see that in my data.
