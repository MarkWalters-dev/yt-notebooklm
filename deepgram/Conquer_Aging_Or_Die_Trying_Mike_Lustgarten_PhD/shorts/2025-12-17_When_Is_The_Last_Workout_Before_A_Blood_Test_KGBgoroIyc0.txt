Before every test, I standardize when the last workout is before the blood test to minimize that potential impact of training or overtraining on the biomarker. So if the blood test is on a Monday at, it's it's a Friday workout, no later than a Friday workout. Monday or Tuesday test Friday workout. So I've got three to four days. Because if if training is gonna negatively impact the biomarkers, how can I see if other stuff, diet, supplements, etcetera, can move the needle? So I think that's an important point. Now in Brian and and Seem's case, I mean, I don't think they it doesn't look like they did a hard workout the day before testing. But for most people who are new to this, I'd recommend standardizing when that last rep workout is.
