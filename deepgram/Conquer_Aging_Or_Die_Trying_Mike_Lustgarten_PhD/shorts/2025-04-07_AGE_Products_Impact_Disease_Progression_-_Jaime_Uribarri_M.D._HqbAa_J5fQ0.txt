So these are the what I call the AG hypothesis. We have the endogenous hyperglycemia. We have the exogenous food, tobacco that are the same structurally. So they have the same endogenous and exogenous, the same structure, and the same functionality if you test it in vitro or in animal. They contribute to the body AG pool. And this body AG pool then induces cross linking, oxidative stress, and inflammation. And this over the long term is what leads to all these chronic noninfectious diseases, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and chronic disease. So we like to believe that if you interrupt the cycle by affecting the dietary intake, you prevent all of these. And, again, we have demonstrated that, but in a small number of such.
