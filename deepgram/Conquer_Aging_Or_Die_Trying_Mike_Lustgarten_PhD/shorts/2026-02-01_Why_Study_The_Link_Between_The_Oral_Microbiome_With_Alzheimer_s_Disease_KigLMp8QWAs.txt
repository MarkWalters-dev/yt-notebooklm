The oral nasal sinus is the closest microbial reservoir to the brain. Some bacteria easily cross the blood brain barrier and then enter the bloodstream, and the distance to do that from the mouth is much closer than the distance and processes traveled from the gut. The bacteria causing periodontal disease, for example, a disease that causes persistent low grade inflammation, causes an increase in inflammatory cytokines, and that has an established contribution to Alzheimer's disease pathology. But despite all of these concepts, the oral gut brain axis still remains very underexplored. So am I suggesting that just swallowing and drinking your water immediately causes entrance of inflammatory bacteria? Obviously not. The oral cavity is a complex and diverse microbial ecosystem. Like any ecosystem, in order to function, balance is the key here. Under normal circumstances, commensal bacteria, or the beneficial microbes, live in harmony with pathogenic bacteria,
