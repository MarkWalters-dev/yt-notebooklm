Lot of microbiome science is really oversold. And, you know, all the data about probiotics in sort of healthy adults who aren't obviously recovering from, like, antibiotic induced diarrhea or something where there's a very clear indication where probiotics work, A lot of the data in healthy young adults says you're throwing your money away if you're you're doing probiotics. But, you know, having a high fiber, low fat, low sugar, Mediterranean type diet has nothing but good science behind it. Right? So I think in sort of youth, middle age, that's where you wanna focus as well because those healthy habits follow you into old age. Right? Now there is actually some data in older adults that's a little bit stronger that says that, you know, maybe you want to supplement with a probiotic. I think where it's kind of interesting is, like, which wins? Like, the good diet or, you know, do you have to sort of manipulate it?
