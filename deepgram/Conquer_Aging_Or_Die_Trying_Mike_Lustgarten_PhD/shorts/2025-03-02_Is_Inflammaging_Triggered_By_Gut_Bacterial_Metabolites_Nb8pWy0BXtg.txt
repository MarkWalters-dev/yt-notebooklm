Low short chain fatty acids Mhmm. Low colonic acidification. Colonic acidification keeps the growth of things like enterobacteria in check. So when you have a more alkaline pH, which is what happens during aging, at least in this few studies that have been shown on colonic pH, You can get an expansion of the enterobacteria. And, actually, there's a few studies that have looked at neurodegenerative disease with a more alkaline pH. So now potentially, you've got more of these enterobacteria, which contain genes for things like pericrystall sulfate and doxyzole sulfate, which I'm sure you know are you know, they damage everything, kidneys, muscle Yeah. Linked with neurodegeneration. So if that's if more of that is in the blood, I'd expect that to potentially impact, you know, pro inflammatory pathways. Is that inflammation? No. I don't know.
