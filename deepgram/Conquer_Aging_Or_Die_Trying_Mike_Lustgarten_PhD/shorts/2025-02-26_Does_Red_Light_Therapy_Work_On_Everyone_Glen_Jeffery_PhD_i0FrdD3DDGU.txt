When we did our first study on macular degeneration, we got nothing. We got no result at all, and I I went away thinking, you know, really questioning questioning what I was doing. And then, you know, I spoke to John Metrophanis about it who's been doing lots of work on primates and Parkinson's disease. And he said, Glenn, you gotta catch it early. If it's gone beyond a certain point, it's not gonna work. So I went back and I looked at the data from the patients that we'd recruited, and they had disease that had dug in. You know, they had you could look at their retina and you could say, oh, they're starting to lose lots of cells. Now someone's replicated my study, and and they've done it on people at a much earlier stage of disease, and I'm pleased to say they got great results. So whatever you do, there's a window for catching things.
