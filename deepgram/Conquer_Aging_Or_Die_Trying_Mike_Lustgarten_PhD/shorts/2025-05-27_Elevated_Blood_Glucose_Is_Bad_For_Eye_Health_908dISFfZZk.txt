People who do have elevated levels of glucose, especially in cases of diabetes, when you have elevated levels of sugars, especially chronically, it it creates what's called a sorbitol there's a sorbitol pathway. So your glucose ends up creating a sugar alcohol, which ends up causing not only swelling of the retinal tissue in the back of the eye, but causes but it causes the lens inside the eye to swell. And so patients who are diabetic, they may not even know that they're diabetic. Maybe their family doctor has missed it or they haven't seen their family doctor, haven't had their their blood sugars checked. I've had patients come in and their glasses prescription has changed three diopters in just a few months. Like, they don't need glasses, and all of a sudden, they need glasses, and it's a that's a huge jump. And the the where when you learn through school and your training to recognize that and be like, hey. There's a good chance you're probably diabetic because the lens has swollen with the sugar alcohol, and now it changes your your refractive status.
