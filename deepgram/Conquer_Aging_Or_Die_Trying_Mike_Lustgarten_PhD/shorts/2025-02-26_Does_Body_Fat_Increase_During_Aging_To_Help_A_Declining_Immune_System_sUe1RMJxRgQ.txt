Immune immune function declines during aging regardless of group. So body fat produces or adipocytes can produce antimicrobial peptides, cathelicidin as an example. So for me, it makes sense that with a declining immune system, there's an increase in body fat percentage that may be compensatory for the declining immune system so that the animals who are able to add body fat, which would explain in in your study why higher body fat at relatively younger ages was associated with a longer lifespan. So, what are your thoughts on on then then it becomes the question of, is this an infection story? You know? So when when the system can't add body fat and it loses that, resilience, then it's basically it's just an autoimmune, condition now where it's shedding muscle that may be infected with microbes and shedding fat. So what are your thoughts in on the infection hypothesis as being a part of this story?
