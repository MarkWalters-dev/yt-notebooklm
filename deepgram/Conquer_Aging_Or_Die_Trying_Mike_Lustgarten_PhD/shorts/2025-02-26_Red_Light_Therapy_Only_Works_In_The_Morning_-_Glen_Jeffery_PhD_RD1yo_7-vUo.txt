This brings in another issue about this whole red light factor, which is it really only works very well in the mornings. Right? So it doesn't really work in the afternoons. Now and that's true again if you're a fly, a mouse, a bee, a human. I think it's critical that you get it in the mornings because when you wake up in your evolutionary history, you've been very vulnerable because you've not been paying attention to anything. So when you wake up in the morning, your blood sugars peak. It whether you've eaten or not, your blood sugars go up. Your hormones all change. You become a lot more geared up to running, doing something. In the afternoon, I cannot improve your mitochondria in the afternoon no matter what I do, how much red light I give them, I cannot improve them. We say, in the afternoon, mitochondria are doing something else.
