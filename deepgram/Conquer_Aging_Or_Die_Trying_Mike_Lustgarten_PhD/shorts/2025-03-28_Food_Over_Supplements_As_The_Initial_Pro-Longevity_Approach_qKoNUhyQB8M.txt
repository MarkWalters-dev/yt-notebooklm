If I can't do everything I can just by the foods that I'm eating and and on it doesn't have to be food. I'm open to the supplements, like I said, but demonstrate a need. If I can't do everything by food, what's gonna happen when I really need that supplement? Right? And if I take the supplement only when I really need it, I think that would be the most efficacious. That should be when it works the most. But if I've been taking that supplement for thirty years, and all of a sudden, I'm taking metformin for glucose, and then it stops working, what am I gonna do? Right? So I don't wanna be in that in that boat.
