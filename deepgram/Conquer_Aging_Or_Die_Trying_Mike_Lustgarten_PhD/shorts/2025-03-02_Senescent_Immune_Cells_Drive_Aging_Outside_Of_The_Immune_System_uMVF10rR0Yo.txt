You know, your findings that, senescent cells, senescent immune cells drive senescent cells in other organs and decreasing organ function or markers of organ function is a humongous finding. And I I honestly, I haven't seen anybody talking about it. I'd expect it to be everywhere. Like, the focus on on gerontology, like, from my point of view, from the preventative side, would be how can we prevent you know, how can we extend youth and definitely minimize our senescence cell burden so that we can extend the health and functionality of our organ system?
