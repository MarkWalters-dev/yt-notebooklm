So you have to have a an immune system that's going to tolerate the generation of new tissues that you haven't had before, and then a fetus, which is, like, genetically different than you. And the thing that's so crazy about this, you tolerate this fetus during pregnancy. You can't necessarily get an organ transplant from one of your kids as an adult because you're no longer tolerant to their body. Right? Like, the thought experiment of the immunology of pregnancy boggles the mind. So So there's that. And then, of course, there's, a lot of the physiological changes. So for example, increased vascularization and gut permeability. So the gut actually grows when you get pregnant to help you absorb more energy for the growing baby. And in our mice, when we do pregnancy studies, it, like, doubles in size. I've never done an autopsy with a human, so I don't know how much bigger it gets, but it gets bigger. So, again, gut is where most of your immune cells are. Gut gets bigger. You're probably gonna have this expansion of all these immune cells during the context of pregnancy.
