I think it is the case that everybody will always die, and it it it's a necessity because we are so complex. The the the the physics of the amount of energy that it takes to maintain the complexity is just it's like gravity. You you can't deny it. Things will break. We have developed mechanisms to fix things when they break, but ultimately, the things that fix the things break. And it there's just entropy is gonna catch up with us. For sure. Heat death Doesn't have to be your opinion. Right? Yeah. No worries. No worries. Let so, you know, heat death of the universe. Right? Eventually, the sun's gonna burn out. Right?
