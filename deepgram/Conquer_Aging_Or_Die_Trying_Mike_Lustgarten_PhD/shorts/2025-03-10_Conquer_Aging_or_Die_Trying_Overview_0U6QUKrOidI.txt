I can't stand the idea of aging. I can't stand the idea of functional decline, and everything that goes with it, increased disease risk, increased mortality rate at for every year that we live, past a certain age. So I'm trying to do everything I can, you know, everything in the scientific literature to my own biohacking pursuits, tracking the correlations, where if I do die and I say if, because just because everyone that's ever lived has died doesn't mean it will always be like that. Eventually, the knowledge of what we know in terms of aging, there is some there is some slope to that. Right? Are we down here where it's flat? We know basically nothing. We're just primitive monkeys in the jungle throwing rocks and stuff hoping that it works, maybe. But the rate of aging is a constant. So how close are we to matching those slopes? Right? I I don't know how close, and the way I look at it is is kind of like the 300 Spartan view. I'm gonna die trying, doing everything I physically can, to try to not die.
