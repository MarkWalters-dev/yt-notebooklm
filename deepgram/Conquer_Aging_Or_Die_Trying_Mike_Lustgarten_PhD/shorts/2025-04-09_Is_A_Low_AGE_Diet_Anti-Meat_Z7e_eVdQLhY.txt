Some pushback that comes at least in the lay community for aged products is they think it's an anti meat story and only eating like, going vegan. And it that I don't think that's the case at all. As you mentioned, it's the cooking methods. You know? Even slow cooking as opposed to frying Sure. Or, right, the browning effect. You wanna avoid the browning effect. This isn't an anti meat story. It's just cook it so that you haven't produced aged products. Absolutely. And for example, they they are some people who have measured with the application of a Mediterranean diet that eat meats too. I mean, even and that it is the way they cook, and they have, they have measured low levels of of AGs. Yeah. So definitely, it's not an anti an anti meat diet. No. No. No. That's what I insisted at the beginning. It's not a diet that tells you, this many carbohydrates or fats or meat, but rather the way the way you cook.
