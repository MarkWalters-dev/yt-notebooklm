Cal restriction dramatically increases SHBG to values greater than a 100. So Mhmm. Now that may not seem like a big big deal, but SHBG binds to total testosterone thereby reducing it in blood, which would then potentially lower free tea. Now in the cow restricted state, as I mentioned, I don't know that that's a big deal, but SHBG increases during aging and higher SHBG just during aging is associated with metabolic syndrome. So now you've got this dichotomy of, okay. Well, CR increases SHBG, but that's a pro longevity potential thing. And then you've got the average population where SHBG increases not on CR, and that's associated with metabolic syndrome. So this isn't as easy of a story as as I think most people put out there.
