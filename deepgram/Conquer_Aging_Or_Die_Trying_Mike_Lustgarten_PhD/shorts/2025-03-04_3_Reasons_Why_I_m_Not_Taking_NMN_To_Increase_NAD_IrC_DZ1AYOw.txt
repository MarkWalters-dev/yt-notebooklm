So my issue though with NMN and using nicotinamide based products, there are two two issues. Right? And you mentioned one of them, which was, the, two p y and four p y, which vascular information. Right? So if I'm taking anything related to nicotinamide, there's the potential for an increase in two p y and four p y. So that's one strike in my in my, book. And then the other, I mean, besides cost, I mean, I I'm I appreciate that you would send free product for a few months, but for most people, they can't. Right? You know? So, so that's the second. But then the third two is homocysteine. So there's published data that nicotinamide raises homocysteine more than nicotinic acid. And and in my case, my homocysteine is already about twice as high as it was in my youth. It's actually probably one of my biggest weak spots and that's without taking nicotinic acid, nicotinamide. So I didn't do the experiment to measure homocysteine. If my homocysteine goes to 15 and my NAD goes to 65, I don't know that I I don't know that I wanna do that.
