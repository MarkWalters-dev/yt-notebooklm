High blood pressure can affect and cause damage to the blood vessels within the eye. And so during an eye exam, it's not uncommon to look inside and just see that the arteries are narrowing. Eventually, the narrowing can turn into a kinking, kind of like you'd imagine a water hose in the summer starting to kink off. And further down the road, you can start to see hemorrhaging or bleeding inside the eye from, either leakage from these blood vessels getting damaged. And then in extreme cases when someone's blood pressure is very elevated, you can even see swelling of the optic nerve itself. So we do have to watch for high blood pressure on its own, which, again, most people don't feel or sense. Blood pressure, uncontrolled contributes and exacerbates so many other conditions, whether it be diabetic retinopathy. There's some association with macular retinopathy or or retinal disease and just your risk for developing against strokes or some sort of occlusive event within the eye.
