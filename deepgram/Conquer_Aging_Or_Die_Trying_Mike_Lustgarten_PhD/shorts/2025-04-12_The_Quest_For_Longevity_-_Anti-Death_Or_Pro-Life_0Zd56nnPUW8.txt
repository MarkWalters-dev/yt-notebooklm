Know I talk about risk of death for all causes in almost all my videos, but I I basically don't think about death at all. I'm focused on the other side of that, which is I can't stand the idea of aging and functional decline. I wanna be as youthful as possible at any chronological age. I don't wanna be good for my chronological age. I wanna be, you know, as good as I physically can be regardless of chronological age. So I look at it from the other side. It's not necessarily avoiding death. It's even though that's a part of the equation, it's staying as healthy and functional for as long as physically possible. Okay. So it's rather more you avoid the the process of of dying. That that's what you you want to avoid. And then, therefore, you're avoiding you're avoiding death.
