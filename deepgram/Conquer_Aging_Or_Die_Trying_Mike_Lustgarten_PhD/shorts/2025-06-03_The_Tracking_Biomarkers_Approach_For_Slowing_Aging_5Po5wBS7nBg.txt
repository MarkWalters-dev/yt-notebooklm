The whole don't die and live forever approach. Yeah. You know? So there are specific things that are gonna kill us. Heart disease, cancer, kidney disease, liver disease. There are gonna be biomarkers of that systemically. They aging is as you know, aging is a disease that happens over the decade. Right? So there's gonna be that pattern. And if you know what these biomarkers look like in youth and in health, we can track that and then say, wow. My kidney function biomarkers look like an 80 year old. What can I do to bring them back to a 30 or a 40 year old? Right? So so that's my approach is is I like that. The biomarker. Yeah. That's great. Yeah. But then it the question is what's the rest of it? Because it's gonna be different for everyone. What works for everybody to be happy. And then even like you were mentioning about latent infections, you know, most people probably have this, like, CMV infections. Everyone above, I think, seventy. It's, like, a hundred percent all infected, and nobody knows that they're infected with it, which may not seem like a problem, but it's associated with immunosenescence, which is a major driver of aging. Right? Right. So, anyway, I'm obsessed with the biomarkers.
