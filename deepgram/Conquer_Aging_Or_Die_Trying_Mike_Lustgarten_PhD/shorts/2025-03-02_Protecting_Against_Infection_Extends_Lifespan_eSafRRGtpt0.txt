Most of our our mice, they live in a really clean, sterile environment. And so we jokingly say, do they even really develop an immune system, or do they just develop this kind of premature immune system? So there's people that do, you know, viral infections. Sepsis is another really good, model, that people do that. There's also, sort of communal pathogenic infections. Like, I worked before. We actually use pet shop mice. And you would co house your mice with pet shop mice and they were full of bacteria and viruses and, you know, young mice eventually would clear them. They would make productive antibody responses, but old mice would not. Not. You know, they would be sensitive to death. But if you could find a lethal agents, like, in one case, we found mouse hepatitis virus was a lethal agent in the bedding. If you immunize the old mice against it or you treated them with some gerit therapeutics, it would increase their survival.
