A component of inflammation is thought to be sterile, but couldn't it be possible that many of these senescent cells are, you know, virally infected or infected with other microbes, and then it's just we're bad at clearing them. So the cell goes senescent to basically turn off the protein, replicating machinery, thereby limiting viral replication. But at the same point then, you know so it's a balance between aging and, you know, infection.
