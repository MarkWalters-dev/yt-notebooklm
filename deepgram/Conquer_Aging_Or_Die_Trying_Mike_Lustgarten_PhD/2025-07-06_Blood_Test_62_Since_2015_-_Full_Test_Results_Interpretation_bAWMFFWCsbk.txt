For blood test number four in 2025, when using doctor Morgan Levine's biological age calculator, PhenoAge, we saw that my biological age was 35 years, which is seventeen years younger than my chronological. Now, anybody can enter data and put it into a spreadsheet. But in today's video, we're going to take a look at the full lab test report as I'm not just measuring nine biomarkers, I'm measuring a whole bunch of other biomarkers trying to cover any potential weak spots. So with that in mind, we'll take a deep dive into the lab test report and I'll provide subsequent analysis. Starting off with page one. And note that for all of the data that I'm gonna show all the test results that I'm gonna show in today's video, I don't go to my doctor to ask to get those tests measured. I go to ultalab test dot com where I specifically pick the test that I want. I then bring that form to Quest Diagnostics or QuestLab which then, gives me the results relatively quickly. So we can see that on May 27, I tested around seven in the morning and then I had the majority of these results two days later. So if you're into blood testing like me and you'd like to help support the channel, you can do that by using the affiliate link in the video's description. Alright. So let's start off at the top with the lipid panel as death from cardiovascular disease is the top cause of death worldwide. And then, let's take a look at HDL or we'll start off with HDL, which I've coded as green as that's movement in the or that's data in the right direction. And that's good news for HDL because it's now 17 tests in a row where HDL is greater than or equal to 50 milligrams per deciliter. In contrast, for the previous 45 tests, so I've got 62 tests for HDL dating back to 2015. For the first 45 tests, HDL was lower at 45. So the relatively higher HDL now greater than 50 for 17 tests in a row is potentially important because what's optimal for HDL at least for men is in the fifty to sixty milligram per deciliter range And that's based on a meta analysis of 3,400,000 people and an even larger study, a non meta analysis of 16,000,000 people. Now, we may be able to add to this story as APO A1 may be a better marker of heart disease mortality risk relative to HDL. And that's particularly important because HDL contains ApoA one as shown there. Nonetheless, with that in mind, I measured ApoA one. So, what's my ApoA one? And that's what we'll see on page two. I'm gonna have to jump around a bit. Unfortunately, Quest's lab test report doesn't put the apolipoproteins directly under the lipid panel which would make the most sense. So, I'm gonna be doing a bit of jumping around in the video to try to be consistent with story. So for APO A1, my data for this test was a 137 milligrams per deciliter which I've coded as red. Technically, I'd be orange. It's not totally red as at first it's better than the reference range at a hundred and fifteen milligrams per deciliter. But note the study that they're using for their determination of the reference range. It's from 2004. Interestingly, there's more recent data from the same study that they used to define their reference range from the Amoris study that was published in 2021 and there's also all cause mortality data for ApoA1 that was published in 2024. So there's more recent data that suggests that the reference range is outdated. So, with that in mind, my optimal range for APO A1 is one fifty to one eighty milligrams per deciliter and with that in mind, my one thirty seven is just a bit below that so I've coded it as red and that's one that I'm going to try to consistently push higher than one fifty. And if you're wondering where I'm getting these data from, I have a new Patreon tier dedicated to specifically what's optimal for biomarkers. Now, if you just type in what's optimal for any of these biomarkers into your favorite LLM, it'll give you the reference ranges. But how do each of these biomarkers change during aging and what's their association with all cause mortality risk? And then, what's the sum of the literature for each of these biomarkers? What's this global story over many papers not just picking one or two? So, I've collected all of that data using 48 published references and collating it into more than two hours of video content. So if you're interested in for what's optimal for these 33 biomarkers including APO A1, check it out on Patreon. Alright. So now, back to our story with triglycerides which here too, I've coded that as red. Even though 65 isn't terribly high, I mean, it's lower than the reference range of one fifty. What's optimal for triglycerides, at least in terms of heart disease mortality risk is or lowest risk is at associated with less than 45. So, that's my target and 65 is a bit higher than that so I've coded it as red. Next up is HDL at 65 is just at the border for my what's optimal for HDL. 65 to one twenty and that's based on a study of 4,500,000 people and I covered that story in-depth on the patreon tier, what's optimal for biomarkers. I know that there's some debate and some confusion that some people think that lower is worse for LDL in terms of all cause mortality risk and that study that story basically comes down to reverse causation and I go into full detail in that story in the Patreon tier. Again, the what's optimal for biomarkers. Even with that in mind though, in that study of four point five million people that accounted for eleven comorbidities that can impact the association for LDL with heart disease mortality risk, there was a small but significant increase for LDL values less than 65. So I don't want to go below that and I'm right at that borderline. So I've got my eye on LDL and again, this isn't taking statins. This is, you know, drug free medication free. I'm not taking anything to keep my LDL relatively low. So, I'm not trying to go below 65 though is the point. So, I've got my eye on that and and I'll try to stay a bit higher if I can. Now, note that VLDL which if we take triglycerides and divide that by five, we can get a pretty close estimation of VLDL, very low density lipoprotein, and LDL contain ApoB. And that's potentially important because as well, as shown here, we can see VLDL has ApoB 100 which is short for ApoB and also LDL has ApoB 100, again, ApoB. So, that's potentially important because ApoB may be a better marker of heart disease mortality risk relative to non HDL cholesterol. And in terms of non HDL cholesterol, as shown there, in my case, it's 79 or at least for this test, 79 milligrams per deciliter. When taking the sum of triglycerides divided by five, again, that equals or is close to VLDL and adding that to LDL, we get seventy eight milligrams per deciliter. So we can see that almost all non HDL cholesterol in my case is coming from VLDL and LDL. So with that in mind, APO B may be a better marker relative to non HDL cholesterol in terms of heart disease mortality risk and I'll link to that study also. There'll be four studies that I'm gonna link to in the papers, video's descriptions. So, let's check out what my data is for a boy B when considering it may be a better marker of heart disease mortality risk. And that's what we'll see here. So APO B for this test was sixty seven milligrams per deciliter. Again, good even just relative to the reference range. But here too, note the papers that they're using to define their reference range. Even though from '29 2019 and 2020 is more recent than the 2004 paper used for APOE one, here too there's more recent data and using large epidemiological studies of more than a 100,000 people in both studies. So, from those two studies, which are again on the Patreon tier, lowest cardiovascular and all cause mortality risk is less than seventy milligrams of per deciliter for ApoB. So, with that in mind, it's good news. Now, you could say these are very strict optimal ranges. Why are you being so strict? Just follow the reference range. Remember, my goal is to live longer than anyone that's ever lived and to do that, I'm gonna have to science out of aging. And with that in mind, I'm trying to use the best available studies, the best available science from the largest studies and I have to be and if I have to be as strict as possible with these reference ranges to maximally minimize my risk, that's the bet I'm gonna take. Now, we can also dig deeper and look at the apo b to apo a one ratio, which for this test was 0.49. Again, good based on the reference range less than point seven seven. Now, if we take just what's optimal for APO B and APO A1 and divide that, lowest cardiovascular and all cause mortality may be less than 0.47. So, here, I'm close but just a bit outside of it. Nonetheless, that's my target, less than 0.47 for this ratio. And when considering that my APOB is relatively low, that's an increasing APOB one story just by a bit to get that lower than 0.47. Alright. Moving on moving along to markers of metabolic health including glucose. So, glucose for this test was 90. No. So, at a first assessment, what's optimal for glucose in terms of all cause mortality risk is in the eighty to ninety four milligram per deciliter range. So, I'm within range so technically, I'm good. But, glucose increases during aging. So, how do I how do I compare? Maybe it was 82, 84, 86 and glucose is going in the wrong direction. Well, actually, for my 59 test average since 2015, average glucose since 2015 is almost identical to this test, 90. So this is good news for glucose for this test. But this is only part of the story because a better marker or at least, better marker of longer term, blood glucose levels or insulin sensitivity is hb a1c. So what's my data for hb a1c? And that's what we'll see here on page three of the report. For this test, it was 5.4. So, again, based on all cause mortality risk, five to six percent and that's in a meta analysis. Five to six percent for HbA1c is optimal In in terms of what's found or what's more likely to be found in youth, average values around five point three to five point four percent are found in people younger than 30 years. So if I just use those two metrics, technically, I'm good and I can just forget about it. But, in October 2023, my hba one c was five point one percent. Hba one c increases during aging and whether this is an age related change or just test to test variability, I'm not sure. But the goal is to have it towards the lower end of my range, which would fit within the how h b a one c changes during aging and the meta analysis data of five to six percent. With that in mind, this isn't just the one test phenomenon of 5.4% for this test. For all four tests in 2025, my average hb one c is 5.38, so essentially 5.4%. So, I've got some work to do to bring it back down to five point one percent. Alright, let's move on to liver, liver health and function biomarkers. First, starting off with albumin, you can see I've coded that as green. Albumin is relatively high. That's good news. Declines during aging and lower levels are associated with an increased all cause mortality risk. Alkaline phosphatase values less than 48 are associated with an increased all cause cause mortality risk. Again, all these data on patreon in the patreon videos, so that my data for this test at 41 is good news. But then, AST and ALT have some room for improvement. Although, 26 doesn't seem terribly high, what's optimal for AST and ALT and this too is based on a very large epidemiological study of more than 10,000,000 people, 27 and 20 nine respectively for AST and ALT is associated with a significantly increased risk of all cause mortality. So, 20 six is pretty close to both twenty seven and 29. So, I've got or my target then is to reduce it to the low teens or sorry, high teens low twenties which is associated with lowest all cause mortality risk. Alright. Next up, I'm measuring total levels of IGG or immunoglobulin g and that may seem like an obscure biomarker but I recently had a video on the channel or I interviewed the scientist, on the channel a scientist on the channel whose group showed that genetic reduction of IGG extended lifespan and interventions that extend lifespan including calorie restriction, exercise training, and parabiosis have lower levels of IGG. So whether that's cause or effect in that case, nonetheless, lowering IgG at least genetically extended lifespan in mice. So can that also be the case in people? I don't know. But I'm willing to, try, you know, I'm willing to do the experiment to see what my IgG levels are to potentially avoid any age related increase and keep them relatively low to gain any potential, lifespan extending effect. So now, with that in mind, I'm not sure if a thousand in my case is optimal or 700 is optimal. So what I'm planning on doing is testing IgG for every test going forward and then doing a biomarker versus biomarker analysis. So IgG versus not just the standard clinical chemistry biomarkers, everything you see on the on the lab report here, but I've also got metabolomic data that I can look at to try to get more insight. Alright, next up are thyroid hormone biomarkers including free t four and free t three. In terms of what's optimal, I'm very close. So, less than point eight is what's optimal based on all cause mortality risk for free t four and greater than 3.2 is associated with lowest risk of death for all causes for free t three. So, I'm right at that border. F t four is a bit too high And, also, what's important here is the ratio because the conversion of f t four to f t three declines during aging. So, with that in mind, my data until mostly recently was point two or less. You can see that my ratio for this test is higher at point three six. So, this is good news. Now, I wish I could say that something in my diet or targeted supplementation did the trick but this is a medication story. So I was able to convince my doctor that I wanted to lower my levothyroxine, my t four dose, which they did, and then they added in t three. So, that's the only reason my thyroid, my thyroid hormone levels are now where they are and have improved. Alright. Next up is Cystatin C. Now, the primary reason that I've included Cystatin C is that it's one of the seven protein biomarkers that the epigenetic clock, GrimAge, which is the best epigenetic clock amongst about 10 epigenetic clocks for evaluating all cause mortality risk. Cystatin c was one of the seven biomarkers used in that prediction. In other words, GrimAge is an epigenetic prediction of seven actual protein biomarkers. One of those biomarkers is Cystatin c. As we'll see later, beta two microglobulin or b two m is another one of those seven and I'm tracking those for every test. I'd rather have the actual biomarkers than the epigenetic prediction of those biomarkers. Alright. So what's optimal for cystatin c? Less than point seven is optimal. And with that in mind, in January 2024, my 0.72 was pretty good news. That should actually be coded red. So then, I forgot about it. Right? I thought, oh, I'm good. This isn't something that's gonna change too quickly. I don't have to worry about it. So for seven tests in a row in 2024, I didn't measure it. Forgot about it. But then, I thought, alright. Let's take a look in 2025. And this 0.84 for this test may not be an anomaly because for the first four tests in 2025, cystatin c's average is 0.81 which obviously is higher than 0.72. So I've got some work to do to reduce cystatin c consistently to 0.7 or less. And, as a quick side note, when you hear people say that they've got perfect biomarkers, this is impossible. All biomarkers, even with all of the standardization that I do. So, you know, no excess or no major exercise three or four days before the test, standardizing hydration status on the morning of the test, standardizing the fasting window, you know, how many hours in a fasting before each test, and then even standardizing the day before diet. So that makes a minimal impact relative to all the dietary changes that I made for say the fifty day period in between tests, there's going to be some test to test variability. And it's impossible to eat exactly the same diet, exactly the same foods every single day and exactly the same amounts unless you're a mouse in a cage. So there's gonna be some test to test variability. So with that in mind, if anyone who says that they have perfect biomarkers, I want to see all of the data. Please show all of your data and this isn't targeted at one person. This is just a broader comment to the, you know, to the full longevity community. To really have perfect biomarkers, we need a lot of data and then we need to look at year to year change. Alright. So, now, moving on. Cystatin C isn't just the biomarker that's used for grim age. It's also or it can also or it's commonly used to evaluate kidney function, in particular, eGFR, the estimated glomerular filtration rate. Hard to say. Now, my eGFR using cystatin c is one zero one. Now, that's potentially important because Cystatin c may be a better biomarker relative to creatinine based estimation or eGFR of kidney function. And that's because creatinine levels are proportional to muscle mass, whereas Cystatin c is less sensitive to changes in muscle mass. Muscle mass declines during aging, hence, creatinine levels will decline during aging if muscle mass has declined. But on the other hand, kidney function can decline during aging, thereby leading to more creatinine in blood. So, someone can have the same creatinine levels at an older age that they did at youth, but muscle mass has declined and kidney function has worsened. So, with that in mind, cystatin c may may be a better better measure relative to creatinine based estimation of kidney function. So how does cystatin c derived eGFR compare with creatinine, at least in my case? And when looking at eGFR calculated with creatinine, we can see that it's a 105 in the same ballpark as cystatin seed, estimated eGFR. So, they're relatively close and pretty much the same. In terms of eGFR, in terms of what may be optimal, eGFR, values of a 100 are average values found in 30 year olds. So, this is good news. Alright. Moving on. Total levels of white blood cells are were flagged by the lab at 3.6 and here's one where I agree with the lab and this is indeed low. Now, note that I don't specifically focus on tracking total white blood cell counts. In terms of especially in terms of, like, when I look at correlations with diet or supplements, I'm not looking at correlations with total white blood cell counts. And that's because white blood cells are not a homogeneous group of cells. They include neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes as more than 97% of total white blood cells. So, tracking those individual cell types are more important to me or provide more information to me especially when considering that neutrophils and monocytes increase during aging and lymphocytes decline during aging. Alright. So, first, neutrophils at sixteen forty two is on the lower side. In terms of what's optimal, neutrophils increase during aging and 2,000 to 3,000 is associated with lowest all cause mortality risk. Values greater than 3,000 to less than 2,000 are associated with an increased risk. So with that in mind, I've coded my neutrophils as red as that would technically be associated with an increased all cause mortality risk. Now, I'm not yet sure if less than 2,000 in my case would be potentially bad for health. To address that, I'm going to do biomarker versus biomarker analysis, neutrophils versus all the other biomarkers to get more insight. When considering that they increase during aging, having them relatively lower in my case, now, that's within the context of low hs CRP and in previous tests, very low levels of IL-six and TNF alpha, pro inflammatory cytokines, may be good news. But I can see the situation and maybe in an older adult who may have low levels of neutrophils, maybe because they can't produce them within the context of elevated inflammation. And that would be potentially bad news, it would suggest that they don't have enough enough neutrophils to clear any microbial invaders, you know, that are systemically around. Right? So, I can see that situation, being a problem at advanced older ages. That currently isn't the case for me. So, it's possible that 1642 may be good news in my data, but still playing it by the book, I've coded it as red. In contrast, I think that the neutrophils being oh, sorry. Lymphocytes being fifteen sixty six is bad news. And that's because lymphocytes decline during aging and values around 1,900 to 2,100 are associated with lowest risk of death for all causes. As lymphocytes decline below 1,900, that's associated with a big spike in terms of all cause mortality risk. And, again, all of the plots are in those more than two hours of video content on Patreon. So, if you're interested in that, check it out. Now, good news though for this test, lymphocytes were higher than they've been for the past four tests. You can see that they were even lower for the, sorry, past three tests before that. And the way I'm doing that is I track diet and I'll go into the diet story more in the next video in this series. The diet that was underlying, you know, this 17 year younger biological age for the May 27 test. But I track correlations with diet and supplements and then based on what the correlation show, I tweak things in the diet or supplements to try to move biomarkers towards the right direction. In terms of the right direction, you know, how did these biomarkers change during aging and all cause mortality risk. So, whether this is something that I did or just tested test to test variability, I'm not sure but I did intentionally follow a few correlations to try to increase my lymphocytes and I'll have more on that in the next video. Alright. I'm also tracking Candida IgG and this goes into the immune story. So, for 11 tests in a row, Candida IgG has been higher than the reference range and I I can't say why that is, but that is it is what it is. If we go back to 2017, I have one test and I wasn't intentionally measuring it. I did a, you know, a, food sensitivity panel that happened to measure, blood levels of Candida IGG and there too was high. So this may be a problem that goes back at least more than eight years. So with that in mind, I was prescribed or I went to the doctor and asked for in a prescribed antifungal as nothing in diet has worked. I've been fit following the correlations. Nothing has worked to bring Candida IgG lower than the reference range. And just as a quick side note, you could say, well, just because it's higher than the reference range doesn't mean anything. You don't have an active infection because IgM isn't relatively high. But, you know, that you've got high relatively high Candida IgG, your immune system is keeping it in check, and that's true. But it suggests that my immune system is doing a bad job of keeping it in check, leading to relatively higher levels of IgG than it would need if it was able to do a good job of keeping it in check. And when you put it in the broader perspective that higher levels of total IGG, so Candida IGG feeds into total IGG, may be bad for lifespan. I find it important or I think it's important to try to bring or help my immune system bring Candida systemic Candida levels in check, thereby reducing Candida IgG. So, I I asked my doctor for a prescription of flu fluconazole which is a prescribed antifungal. I took the lowest dose, two hundred milligrams per day for twelve days before, before this test sorry, after this test. And I did that, for a June 11 test test, and unfortunately, it didn't reduce Candida IgG below the reference range so still high at that dose. Now, I still do have some fluconazole. I'm planning on if the the next test on July 22, so coming up really soon. If it's not lower and I've been following some correlations to try to impact Candida IgG without any prescribed antifungals, I'm planning on testing again with fluconazole, only this time with four hundred milligrams per day. And because I only have one month supply, I can only do that for about a week. So that'll be probably some time for an August test assuming that I haven't figured out the Candida IgG story for the next test in later in July. Now, another weak spot is, or at least for this test, was DHEA Sulfate. So, DHEA Sulfate declines during aging with values around 300, or average values of around 300 more likely to be found in 20 year olds relative to people that are chronologically older. Now, a 110 is my second worst or second lowest DHEA sulfate value over 22 tests since 2022. And this is below my 22 to 22 test average over that time too. So this definitely moved in the wrong direction. Now, part of this story, as a side note, because I'm still, you know, doing, doing the analysis on my own before I, you know, see if there's a real story here. But I did a biomarker versus biomarker analysis and when considering that cholesterol is used to make DHEA and correspondingly, sulfation leads to DHEA sulfate. LDL is positively correlated with DHEA sulfate in my data, but when considering that higher levels of LDL will increase or potentially increase apol b, I'm not sure that I wanna increase LDL to increase DHEA sulfate. So I'm currently looking at correlations between the ratio of DHEA sulfate to LDL. In other words, the conversion can I impact the conversion of LDL to DHEA sulfate without raising LDL? So, that's one strategy. I've got some other ideas that I won't go into this video but I've got a few, thoughts about how I may be able to reverse my DHEA sulfate. Again, that's without taking exogenous DHEA. I can definitely do that, but this is almost like waving the white flag in my case. You know, it's basically like me saying, I can't do it endogenously. I have to do it exogenously. I can't rejuvenate myself systemically just doing it naturally. Even though I'm not opposed to doing it exogenously, I want to give some time and have enough tests to really try to learn the recipe for improving DHEA sulfate and other biomarkers before I go to the exogenous route. They could say, alright, what about your thyroid hormones? Well, that's a story that goes back to my twenties. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my mid twenties and I had thyroid gland atrophy. So, I've been taking thyroid hormone meds for, you know, more than half my life. I'm not sure I've got adrenal gland dysfunction, thereby leading to DHEA sulfate, relatively low levels, at least not yet. But I'd like to collect more data before I would jump on the just take DHEA and that should increase DHEA sulfate, you know, bandwagon or train. I also mentioned that I'm measuring b two m or beta two microglobulin because it's a part of GrimAge and, again, I'd rather measure the actual biomarkers than the epigenetic prediction. Even though GrimAge is an epigenetic clock for its epigenetic prediction that's associated with all cause mortality risk is the best amongst 10 clocks that were studied and I covered that in an earlier video. If you missed it, it'll be in the right corner. In terms of what's optimal for b to m, lower is better and 1.55 isn't terribly high but I prefer to have values closer to one than where they are right now. I only have two tests so I can't say what the recipe is for moving it lower and there isn't anything published that, you know, how do you keep b two m low. So, stay tuned for that story in a future video because I've got to collect a lot more data in order to know what may impact. Alright. Next up, on to red blood cell related measures including the red blood cell distribution width, which for those who don't know is the major predictor of biological age using the, Doctor. Morgan Levine's biological age clock which I mentioned in the beginning, PhenoAge. So, twelve point two is technically good news. If we look at what's optimal for RDW and this is based on a study of three point four million people, we can see that lowest all cause mortality risk is associated with eleven point four to twelve point six. So with that in mind, 12.2 is good news. I'm within that tighter optimal range relative to the reference range. But, if we look at the most recent data for the past five tests, the data is moving in the wrong direction and RDW increases during aging. So, for the past five tests, you can see eleven seven, eleven eight, eleven eight, twelve, twelve two. It's going in the wrong direction. So, this isn't just about, am I within the optimal range? It's, am I following the age related trend or resisting it? You know, following the trend or resisting the trend? In my case, at least, for the last five tests for RDW, although, it's in the optimal range, it's it's moving in the wrong direction. So I've got to try to push it lower if I can and again, to do that, I follow what, you know, the correlation show with diet and other variables. I also tracked two other red blood cell related measures including the MCV, the average red blood cell volume. So the average volume of red blood cells increases during aging. So, hence, the MCV increases during aging. So 92 '3 isn't terribly high especially when considering that my average for 2025 is currently 92 over four tests which is better than the eight test average in 2024 of ninety two point seven. But both of these data are worse than my 57 test average since 2015 which is 90.7. So the goal is to get it closer to 90.7 even a bit lower as that's associated with lowest risk of death for all causes if I can. So it we can see that my data is starting to track in the wrong direction. So I've got to try to follow correlations the best that I can to try to move that away from, you know, how it changes during aging and towards the increased all cause mortality risk. I'm also tracking hemoglobin and here too, I've coded this as as red even though lowest all cause mortality risk for men is in the 14 to 15.9, range. Now, the range is a bit different for women. I covered that in the Patreon video but that's a story for another day. So, 14.6 is within that range and technically not bad news, right? Well, my average hemoglobin since 2015 is 15 and that's over 15 tests. So the goal is to get it back there. Now, adding more context over eight tests in 2024, average hemoglobin was 14.8. So a bit below that that 57 test average. And after the first four tests, it's 14.7. So you could say, I'm being nitpicky. This isn't a big deal. These are tenths of a gram per deciliter, but let's play this out. If my eight test average for hemoglobin declines by point one gram per deciliter per year, after ten years, that's one gram per deciliter lower. Now, it's not 14.7, maybe it's 13.7. Now, that's associated with an increased all cause mortality risk. Even if you slow the rate of that down where it's point zero five grams per deciliter decline per year, after twenty years, now I'm still lower than that optimal range of 14 to 15.9. So, my goal is to get it back to 15 if I can and follow the correlations as best I can to try to resist age related change. Two more biomarkers. H s c r p point two milligrams per liter. This is the lab's detection limit. They can't tell me. Unfortunately, Quest can't tell me the actual value below 0.2, but it's not higher 0.2 is that's their limit. And this is good news. I've coded it as green because it's now 25 consecutive tests where HSCRP is less than or equal to the labs detection limit, which was point three milligrams per liter. For the past nine tests, for whatever reason, Quest has improved the sensitivity of their assay or at least reporting to a lower limit. And for nine consecutive tests, hs CRP is less than 0.2 milligrams per liter. So the hs CRP data is good news and this is going back for more than three years. On the other hand, an another weak spot and again, see, I have weak spots. PhenoAge may be good news, my biological age may be good or great news, but I do have some weak spots and I'm trying to cover all the weak spots. There is no such thing as everybody has perfect biomarkers. And if I'm wrong, and if someone has perfect biomarkers and relatively older ages, please show your data and and let's share and share how you're doing it because I think the community would benefit. So, homocysteine at 10.7 here too isn't terribly high but I've had values that were half that about twenty years ago. So and here at this point in the video, I can already hear a lot of you saying TMG, take TMG. I've done that experiment. Four grams of TMG didn't make a dent in the past, but somebody on the channel commented maybe you're zinc deficient and that may be part of the reason why. So betaine methanrexyrase requires zinc for maximum activity. My diet, although it's not low in zinc, it's above the RDA, consistently above the RDA for every test. Maybe that's not high enough. Maybe the phytates that are in some of the foods that I eat, including nuts and seeds and whole grains, maybe that's limiting zinc absorption. And then, for those who are not on a high fiber diet like me, maybe they'll say, oh, go keto, go carnivore. One step at a time. I'm gonna test the hypothesis that maybe suboptimal zinc levels are associated with this homocysteine story or at least homocysteine moving in the wrong direction. What the mechanism is yet, I don't yet know. Whether it's a phytate story, I don't yet know but I've added supplemental zinc relatively low dose into the diet to test that hypothesis and I've added some sources of dietary betaine that I took out for a few tests including, beets and amaranth, which I added. This is that's actually a new addition, which contained trimethylglycine or betaine in conjunction with that zinc supplementation to see if that can bring homocysteine down for the July 22 test. Now, there's another part of the homocysteine story that's important to mention. Homocysteine on its own accelerates cell senescence at least for endothelial cells and for, neurons. Now, that's important to say because whenever I bring up homocysteine as a metabolite, there's always people who say, well, lowering homocysteine doesn't improve cardiovascular related outcomes in randomized controlled trials. Now, that may be true. Maybe, reducing homocysteine doesn't impact it in people who have pre existing CBD. On one hand, I'm looking at it as a preventive preventative measure. I'm trying to keep relatively low so I don't don't end up with CBD and then, I'm not trying to reduce homocysteine and see if that improves CBD related outcomes. On the other hand too, considering that homocysteine on its own can lead to cell senescence in at least in vitro of the endothelial cells and neurons. I'm trying to keep it as low as possible. Again, as close to five as possible. Alright. That's all for now. If you're interested in more about my attempts to biohack aging, check us out on Patreon where I include blood test consults for those who are interested in optimizing their own blood test data. And on Patreon, I post at least twice a day in those other four Patreon tiers. We've also got a whole bunch of discount and affiliate links that you can use to test yourself that help support the channel, including altalabtest.com where I get the majority of my blood tests, the Clearly Filtered Water Filter which I'm using every day, at home metabolomics and test results for test number 18 just came in. So, I'm currently analyzing that. Oral microbiome composition, I'm still battling the serrata story so stay tuned for some update videos probably coming later in the year. NED testing with G infinity, epigenetic testing with true diagnostic, at home blood testing with Cyphox Health which includes the grim age, the DNA methylation test test grim age. So if you wanna the the best epigenetic clock amongst the 10, 10 epigenetic clocks, that's the one to get or maybe you wanna measure the protein biomarkers including cystatin c and b two n as I'm doing. Green tea, drinking it every day. Diet tracking with Cronometer, doing that every day too. Or if you'd like to support the channel, you can do that with the website, buy me a coffee. We've also got merch including the Figuring Stuff Out is My Drug which is probably gonna be my most favorite shirt of all time because it's true. It's basically my motto. This is the most important thing in my life. Figuring stuff out is literally a drug to me. Or we've got other merch including the one I've got on here, conquer agent or die trying the channel's theme. Links to that are in the video's description. Thanks for watching. Hope that you enjoyed the video. Have a great day.
