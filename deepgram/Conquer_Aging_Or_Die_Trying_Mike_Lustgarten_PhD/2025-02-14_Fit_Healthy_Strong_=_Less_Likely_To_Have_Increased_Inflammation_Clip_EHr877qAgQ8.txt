This is what 75 can look like. I know this is I am always comforted by the fact that the woman on the left didn't start working out till she was in her sixties, so I figured there's lots of time to get those abs. But, one of the things we know from various immunology studies is that if you're, like, the woman on the left, fit, healthy, strong, you're less likely to have this chronic inflammation. And if you're on the woman on the right who's clearly unwell, having mobility issues, you're way more likely to be higher than that age average inflammation. So if the microbiome is truly a link to this chronic inflammation, then it could be something that we could target to help give us all the healthy, vibrant life we want.
