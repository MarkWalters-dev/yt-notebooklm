So I like to propose that we need to better figure out better ways of rewilding our lives. And we're doing this by developing microbial building materials where we actually take bacteria, and we build them into the structures that we use to build our, built environments, creating also living walls that contain microbes and plants to allow for improved immune activation of people breathing and working in that space. Increased ventilation is also valuable if you have a beneficial microbiome outside your house. And even multigenerational living could be improving. Right? Moving from this this, very, suburban, wealthy environment where we live in our little bubbles, to more interacting with each other on a much more, day to day basis. For example, we see that lactobacillus, a bacteria which is generally associated with health in our lung and on our skin and in our gut, can be at greater proportions in people who are, who infants who have older siblings in their home, potentially because those older siblings are interacting with the wide world and bringing that wide world back into the home for the children.
