Hey, everyone. Today's guest is Dave Pascoe for the second time on the channel. Now you've seen Dave all over the interwebs, but today's gonna be be completely different. Today, we're gonna take a deep dive into Dave's blood test data, and we're gonna start off with biological age and then go through, markers of organ systems, so kidney, liver, immune, and identify strengths, weaknesses, and all of the data on the map. So with that, welcome. And, I guess let's start with PhenoAge. Thank you, Mike. It's great to be back again. By the way, I I like to call this particular episode the good, the bad, and the ugly. Nice. So you see, like, in 2020, I seem to be doing a whole lot better than I I did in, like, 2021. I I show the the year, so this would be the average trend. That would be the actual FeNO age. That's my you know, 58 there was would be my chrono age at the beginning of that year. And so you can see I am, I am increasing as the years go by, but now, like, in 2024, 2025, I'm starting my downhill slide. So, hopefully, I can keep that trend going. Pretty pretty stable, though. I mean, starting in, I think yeah. So 2021, it it's pretty it's about ten years younger, all the way across. Like, so pheno age increases by point nine years for every year of chronological age. So starting in 2021, you should be you know, so that's four plus years later or three and a half years later. So that should be three years older. So your average pheno age for 2025 should be 51, 52. Whereas it's still you can see it's in the ballpark, 48.65. So you've you've resisted that, year year to year pheno age increase, even if all biomarkers stay the same. So that's good news. I mean, that's basically slowing, you know, the rate of aging over time. So far so good. I guess we'll we'll see how things go in the future. The other thing to point out is how many tests that you're this isn't one data point. So how many what is that in 2021? How many how many data points? How many times did you measure? Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, about, yeah, roughly 12. I usually do about one test per month. So there's usually about, you know, eleven, twelve data points each year. Nice. That I mean, year to year change, having more data is better, so that that's great news. And then what what was going on in 2024? It looks like in May through the end of the year, I mean, it's like one, two, three, four, five tests all going in the wrong direction. Yeah. That I would really have to go dig to figure out what was happening with that. I don't I don't know. Let's think. Oh, yeah. Actually, I do know what was happening with that. Okay. So, because I can think back to how my, actual true diagnostic data went. It was around August time frame that, Sierra Clark came out to my home and did all the recording. Right? And I put myself through a ton of stress because the house had just gotten remodeled. There was construction dust everywhere. I didn't know what the film crew was gonna pick up. So, I mean, I just did a deep dive inside, outside the house, you know, fixing everything, cleaning. I was really under a lot of stress. Then, like, October time frame, I got COVID. And so that's probably where a lot of this increased. And then we, you know, we came back down again after the New Year and then, like, dropping ever since. Nice. Except for this last one. So when it when it comes to testing, are you standardizing before a test? Like, for example, if you're testing on a Monday, when's the last when's your last workout? Have you standardized that test to test? No. I have not, and I do need to do that. I I typically will test, like, maybe on the fifth of the month. Well, actually, you can see here. Sometimes it's the seventh of the month. Sometimes it's the fifth, the third. So I always try to hit closest to the beginning of the month when I can. But no. I mean, now I am. I know I'm trying to standardize. Like, at least, if it's gonna be a Monday, not working out at all on Sunday. Yeah. Trying to be more more thoughtful about the water than I drink beforehand, you know, so I'm not dehydrated. There's a lot of times I was just rolling out of bed and just driving straight over and taking the test because I wanna be fasted. But, yeah, now I wanna make sure that I've got at least some water in me that makes the blood flow better. But it also makes the tests more probably more accurate. So, have you standardized how much water, or it's just just some rather than none? Yeah. No. I I have not standardized on how much. It would be just one of my my standard mugs full of water, which is probably about two cups. What do you recommend? So I do about 16 to 20 ounces, in that range. Not more and not less. But it I don't think the amount matters just as long as you get some water in there. How much you would need is debatable, like because, you know, for me, I can urinate it out most of it in two hours. So I know that that's a decent amount. So if it was eight ounces, maybe I wouldn't urinate any of it out in two hours. So maybe that would be an, you know, insufficient amount. So it sounds like two cups is enough, 16 ounces in your case. So, the other factor, though, is the fasting window. So, you know, so what's recommend is generally overnight fast. But is is there is there an introduction of variability in the blood test data if you fast eight hours, twelve hours, sixteen hours? That's a great question. Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, and I'm not eating the same food every day either. So that's more even more variability. Yeah. So are there plans to, you know, note the fasting window? Or or or because if that so so if you know, imagine if some of your data is impacted by maybe one test you fasted for shorter versus longer duration, then it's harder to know what may move move the needle, right, when it may have just been the fasting window. Right. I I generally have a core diet that I stick to day before the test even though, you know, for the forty to fifty day period before, there may be more variability in diet. But for definitely the day before the test, there I do have a core diet that I basically stick to so that it's not previous day diet that's messing up or impacting biomarkers, but I don't know. Just just an idea. Just No. That that's a brilliant idea. I never actually considered that. That's why I love what you do because what you do is I mean, of all the, influencers that claim they're doing science, you are the one that truly is doing science. The rest of us are just sort of, you know, hackers, which so I've been sort of hacking around at this not, not maybe being as intentional as I could be. So I I think I'm gonna take your advice and do that moving forward. Cool. Try to figure out some meal that I'm gonna make as my standard that I'll do before the test. Yeah. At least the core so that you know? Yeah. Alright. So so let's can we deep can we do a deep dive into PhenoAge's components? So the biggest predictor of PhenoAge is RDW, so maybe starting there and seeing how that's changed over time. So let's go to what are we looking for? So we're looking for yeah. Blood Yep. Yep. K. Let's generate that. Okay. So And wait. Real quick. I think it's I think it's important for people to know that, like, there's this idea of cherry picking your best data and then saying that this is your rate of aging or this is your biological age or this is your marker of organ health and only doing it, like, once per year. But is that really this is Mike on the diatribe, right, on the soliloquy. But is that really representative of your true data? Like, how many how many tests would one need to get an accurate representation of year to year change for a biomarker, for biomarkers of organ systems, for biological age, etcetera. Right? So, I mean, you've got more data than me in in some cases. So, you know, this illustrates, you know, tracking as much as you can and then looking at your year to year change. You you can imagine if we did this like Brian Johnson does and pick our best value out of the past two years of each of these different, you know, each of these different markers and then present that all in one spreadsheet for people to say, look. Look how great I am. The sad thing the sad thing about that is, like and the thing is I'm still torn on Brian. Sometimes I listen to him, and it's like, he's saying all the right things. And then I see the other side where people are just attacking him for things, and then he calls them bad actors. But he doesn't actually address the thing that he's being challenged on, which Because he can't. That's the problem. So then it's like, is it malicious intent, or is it outright ignorance? I I don't know which Yeah. I I who knows? I mean, we can't guess what's going on in somebody else's mind, but it certainly doesn't look good. Yeah. And then it's like, if it is if the idea is to cherry pick one's best data, and then so many people are gonna follow that approach and think that that's how we should be slowing aging and and, you know, potentially slowing disease risk and max maximizing longevity. I mean, how many people are gonna be led astray? You know what I mean? So, That's that's why I really love that you showed your blood work the other day, and we're gonna show mine now just to show people that real blood work is messy. It's all over the place. Nothing is perfect. Yeah. So if if somebody presents a a front that, you know, everything they do is just perfect and right on on par, they're probably not being honest. Yeah. For sure. I've got weak spots. I've got, like, some eczema going on in my eyelid and my lip now. I'm still trying to figure out what's going on there. And for people who don't know, I've got the glasses on for the first time, and this is a new thing that I just, you know, initiated about a month ago. So alright. So RDW. Let's start off with, RDW as it's the biggest predictor of, phenOH. Here we go. Right here. Yeah. Can we zoom in just on that one and and Sure. And move the other ones or move that to a separate You know, I was going to create the drop down so that I would just generate one at a time, but I, unfortunately, I didn't get that implemented in time for our Oh, no worries. No worries. In here. So is that, how is that? Yeah. Does it look decent on your end? Yeah. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. So luckily, my trend isn't, like, super steep, but I do I am trending as an increase, which is why the the heading is in red. So if I'm trending in the direction of aging, it's it shows in red. If I'm trending in the direction the opposite direction of aging, it's showing in the head the title in green. Alright. Wait. That's that's I'm a little bit confused, Dave. So could because the red lines are parallel No. Well, I'm sorry. I mean, the title if the title is in red, that means I'm this black trend line is trending in the direction of aging, so I'm going in the wrong way, the wrong direction. That's a very mild trend. I mean, granted, looks pretty flat. You know? So the black line is your trend line. Okay. Yeah. It's it's And you can see I'm within the reference ranges here. The button the two red lines are the top and bottom of the reference range. But my optimal my optimal is, like, really, really tight. My optimal is down here. So this is really where I would like to be in this range. So wait. So that's that's a good point to illustrate. So how are you determining? So your optimal is different from mine. So how are you determining optimal for just RDW in this case? So I would have to go back to my reference table, which is gonna be like an eye chart for you guys. So let's see. RDW, this is alphabetized. A lot of my data, I cross referenced with yours, with other stuff that I'd received, like, from other, you know, books and podcasts that I listen to, and, of course, you know, even using some chat GPT to to look into stuff. So So RDW. Here's, the reference range for, LabCore was 11.6 to 15.4. Yeah. I could I can zoom in on this if you can't see that. Yeah. That's a wide range. But your optimal range, your specific what My optimal range. I set that between, like, 8.1 to 12.5. But why that specific? Do you know where where you or it's just, like, the accumulation of So let's see if I actually included that here. Yeah. Because I think it was a little bit different on the plot. Increases with aging. Definitely. Yep. Interesting. It should not be different in my plot, but let's see. So 8.1 to 12.5. Let's go back to the plot. That's what was throwing me off. I think the upper upper limit on your range can you zoom it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So your green the green upper limit on the green was, like, 12.7. It was, like, eight to 12.7 that yeah. It just seems a little bit high. Not seems, but so 11 I think off the top of my head, 11.4 to 12.6, and that's based on all cause mortality risk. And then, obviously, increases during aging, that's my optimal range. There it can be tricky, though, below 11.4. Even though that's a rare event in terms of, how many people have RDWs that low, there is a significant increase for all cause mortality risk below 11.4, but the paper that I'm referencing, it, it didn't differentiate where below 11.4. Like, it separated everybody who is 11.4 into, percentiles. So there's just no way to know where below 11.4 that increase in all cause mortality risk was, but, nonetheless, that's a rare thing. Most people don't have RDW below, 11.4. Yeah. I'm a little puzzled because usually on my reference table, I'll have the, the reasoning why I set, my optimal range is where I did. But for RDW, I don't have that. So I couldn't even tell you where I got those optimal values from. Interesting. Alright. So wait. So your average then is somewhere around 13? That's about what it looks like. Yeah. And then This would be my trend line, which I guess is, is plotted on my average, I think. So, yeah, so I'm between twelve point seven and thirteen point seven. Yeah. Maybe 13.2 then, maybe somewhere in the middle. So, yeah, there too, you had a bunch of data points that were higher, and then you've had lately, you've they you know, they've all been a lot better. So any ideas what you you may have done to flip that? No. No. Actually, I don't, because I I don't know what, what supplements I've been modifying that would have impact on RDW, to be totally honest with you. It's not something I've been targeting. So its movement is a side effect of other things that I've been doing. Not nothing intentional that I've been doing to move RDW. Interesting. And, you know, whatever you did because you can see that the what is that? Three, five, eight, ten I mean, thirteen, fourteen fourteen above your average, and then almost all of it below that. You know? So whatever you did, what is that? 2021 to 2023. Whatever you did there, whatever you changed, I mean, it's made a big dent in bringing it down. So that's good news. Yeah. I you know, I do have, there's there's different tabs for, every blood test, all of the things that I was targeting for the next test. But, I mean, that would probably take us a good ten minutes for me to drill down and see what it was that I was doing at those particular times. But off the top of my head, I couldn't tell you. See, if if if there was a way that you could drill down on what may have been behind that RDW decrease, I mean, that's like you know, most people struggle, I think, with RDW and bringing it down and it that it increases during aging and that for, you know, the the majority of, you know, what whatever that is, the past 15 tests relative to the 15 tests before that, that you've gotten to it to go in the right direction. I mean, I think that's big news. It's just a matter of what may have caused it is, you know, is is the big question. In your case, it's Yeah. Not that you got leaner. Right? I mean, you've been relative your body weight and workouts have been relatively stable, which suggests that it's gotta be something supplement or diet wise. Yeah. Or exercise, maybe. More fit versus less fit or less fit in the above average data and more fit now? Yeah. That's a great question. I probably could drill down, you know, into that data, but it would take me some time to do the investigation. One reason I make all the videos I make is because it forces me to try to figure it out and then try to tell that story. So I I'm not saying that's what you should do, but it's just, you know, an interesting observation that I think many people could, you know, benefit from. Yeah. I mean, now I'm super curious because I before we started talking, I didn't have any of this stuff graphed. So I I would really didn't have this nice pictorial view of my own data to be able to see, am I going in the right direction or not? So this has helped me quite a bit now that I can see this. So I I can be intentional about things. My RDW, I thought, was usually so stable that, I've never had any intention of moving it intentionally. Interesting. Wow. Yeah. But you but then after you plotted it, you could see that you had some variability where it was you know? And and that's not like one test where it's above your average. I mean, that was a lot of tests, and then not the test below. Right? So something really moved the needle there. So Yeah. So now I'll be curious to drill down and find that out for myself. Yeah. And wait. So the most recent data would probably be I mean, it's below that 12.7. So probably around 12.6. Right? Somewhere around there? I mean, we can actually go to the real data if you wanna see that. Go to full Most for the most recent test. Okay. So But the most recent test that you have, I guess, what, three tests so far in 2025? Yes. Yes. So we're gonna have 12.7, 12.4, 12.9. And not bad. Not bad. And then wait. Wait. Wait. I've got four tests. Actually, I've got two of them here from, February because one I did with Life Extension, and the other one I did with Ulta Labs. So Gotcha. Alright. Yeah. Not not too bad. I mean, I'd wanna see it 12.5 even closer to 12, but it's a lot better than the, probably, 13 or 14 that you had, you know, two years before that.
