For blood test number two in 2025, when using doctor Morgan Levine's biological age calculator PhenoAge, we saw that my biological age was 29.8 years which is twenty two years younger than my chronological. Now, note that this biological age calculator includes nine biomarkers that are representative of many organ systems, but it may have blind spots. And with that in mind, I'm measuring a whole bunch of other stuff. So today, in today's video, we'll take a look at the full lab test report, and we'll identify strengths and weaknesses. So starting off with page one, and note that these blood tests and all of the blood tests that are in this video, I don't go to my doctor to order them or basically plead with them to order them. I go to altalabtest.com, where I pick exactly the test that I want, I then bring that to Quest Diagnostics, pay the blood draw fee which is less than $10, and then I get the majority of these results next day or within a few days. So if you're into blood testing like me and you wanna help support the channel, there's an affiliate link in the video's description. Alright. So let's start off at the top. Starting with HDL which was 67 milligrams per deciliter. Now, generally, most people think that higher is better for HDL. And with that in mind, my HDL has now been greater than or equal to 50 for 15 tests in a row. And HDL average over that The HDL average over those 15 tests is 57. Now, that's good news because the optimal range for HDL and that's based on a meta analysis of 3,400,000 people is 50 to 60 at least in men. It's a slightly wider range in women. The optimal range is fifty to sixty milligrams per deciliter. So with that in mind, I've coded my HDL as red as it's a bit too high. Now, you could say, alright. The the risk increase for 67 versus 60 maybe it's not that great. But, it's stated that's moving in the wrong direction. And I'll have more on the HDL story as it links potentially links with lymphocytes a bit later in the video. Alright. Next up are triglycerides. So although my sixty six milligrams per deciliter isn't terribly high, there is published data that less than forty five is associated with lowest risk of death from coronary heart disease. And heart disease runs in my family, so less than forty five is my current target. So I've got a little bit of work to do as they're currently 66. Now, note that if I focused on the reference range for these and other biomarkers as I'll go into in-depth in this video, I would be misleading myself into thinking that I'm complete completely fine just based on the reference range. For example, the labs reference range for HDL is just greater than 40 with no upper limit. And for triglycerides, it's anything less than one fifty. So, note that the reference range is not the optimal range. And I know that because I have a tier specifically designed for what's optimal for biomarkers on Patreon. This tier currently includes more than two hours of content, 45 data from 45 published papers for how each of these 29 biomarkers changes during aging, and how they associate with risk of death for all causes. So if you're interested in what may be optimal for health and longevity, rather than focusing on the reference range, this may be the tier for you. It also includes what's optimal for those lipoproteins HDL, LDL, and triglycerides. As now, we'll take a look at my LDL. So for this test, it was seventy nine milligrams per deciliter which is in the optimal range. 65 to one twenty. And again, that's based on lowest coronary heart disease, prob mortality risk. Now, there are some epidemiological papers that show higher LDL is optimal. I covered that in-depth in the Patreon video, and I may include that in a future YouTube video with a bit more to the story of how reverse causation is likely driving, the the lower HDL is worse effect. But that's a story for another day. Onto h s c r p, which was again less than point two milligrams per liter. Note that it's now 23 tests in a row where h s c r p has been the detection limit from the lab. The detection limit for QuestLab used to be less than point three milligrams per liter. So it was it's been 23 tests where I've been below that. But for the past six tests in a row, for whatever reason, Quest lower limit is now point two milligrams per liter, and I've been at exactly that for six tests in a row. So good news for HSCRP. And then a weak spot, homocysteine 11.1. If we go by the reference range, I'm good. But I've had values that were close to half of this about twenty years ago, so this is not a genetic effect. And for those who are, into measuring homocysteine that are right now screaming, take TMG. I've experimented with high dose TMG in the past, four grams per day, didn't make a dent. What may make a dent based on correlations with biomarkers is a combination supplement with Methyl b twelve, Methylfolate, and low dose b six. So I've reintroduced that and I went into depth on Patreon and a Patreon post based on the correlations, why I made that reentry into the approach. So if you're interested in that, check it out. I started that, supplement on March 22. I'm planning on testing all of this again on April 22, March 27 to April 22. So, I have about three to four weeks, to see if it makes a potential dent on Homocysteine. Alright. Onto page two. So, Apo a one was a hundred and fifty milligrams per deciliter. Apo b, 68. And the apo a a b, apo b to apo a one ratio was point four five. Now, we can see that each of these are good based on the reference range. But, what's optimal for each of these three biomarkers? So that's what we'll see here. On the y axis, we've got the hazard ratio for having a major adverse cardiovascular event or MACE. Now, MACE included a non fatal myocardial infarction. So, having a heart attack but not dying, stroke, and deaths from cardiovascular disease. And this study included a hundred and thirty seven thousand people with an eighteen year follow-up. In other words, starting from the initial assessment of APO b, APO a one, and the ratio, who was who had a major adverse cardiovascular event eighteen years later and who didn't. On the z axis, we've got Apo b levels and on the x axis, x axis, we've got Apo a one. Alright. So what's optimal? So for Apo b, we can see that less than seventy six milligrams per deciliter. Note that the units are different on this chart. It says, Apo b and grams per liter. So for ease, because on the lab report, it's in milligrams per deciliter. So I've converted it grams to liter into milligrams per deciliter for consistency with the lab report. So based on this plot, we can see that lowest risk for MACE is when ApoB is less than seventy six milligrams per deciliter. Now, for this test, I was 68. Now, that's So that's good news. But note that one test isn't gonna really, you know, increase your risk. It's year to year change. So, I'm Obviously, for this and all the other biomarkers, I'm tracking up to eight times per year, maybe more this year. Eight times per year and taking yearly averages, and then tracking that over time, many years, and with the goal of keeping as many biomarkers as youthful and healthy as possible to minimize risk. Not just for having mace, but all cause mortality and hopefully that can help extend my longevity. So we're all good with ApoB. Now, what's what about the reference range? So the reference range as shown on the previous, slide was less than ninety milligrams per deciliter. So how does that look on this plot? So we can see that the data is still in the green, but you can see that risk has increased. And if ApoB continues to increase above that, now we can see that values that are a hundred and ninety milligrams per per deciliter are close to a ninety percent increased risk of having a major adverse cardiovascular event up to sometime up to eighteen years later from the initial assessment. Alright. So what about Apo a one? So based on this plot, we can see that greater than one fifty, a hundred and fifty milligrams per deciliter may be optimal. As the green boxes are completely flat, so lowest risk, lowest MACE risk when Apo a one is greater than a 150. Now, for this test, that was exactly at one fifty. So, all good there. What about the reference range though? So based on the data on the last page, they Quest Labs suggest greater than one fifteen, hundred and fifteen milligrams per deciliter. And based on the plot here, we can see that that's definitely moving in the wrong direction. Now, we're at the greens and into an increased intermediate risk as it's now in the yellow. So again, if we're focusing on the reference range, this may not be optimal, and there is data here, you know, that would suggest a tighter optimal range. So what about the ratio? Apo b to Apo a one. Based on this plot, point two to point six. And my ratio of point four five or would be would be good based on this one test. Now, the lab test report though shows less than point seven seven which here too is now in the intermediate risk, increased in intermediate risk based on the April a April sorry, April b to April a one ratio. That's an error I wrote that. I had it backwards, you know, in in the reference range. So apologies for that. But nonetheless, it would be an increased intermediate risk. So we can see now that what's optimal is different from the reference range. But then there's a different question that we can ask. Why are these data different? Why aren't the reference ranges, up to date with the most current scientific information? And it's not even the most current scientific information. This data was published in 2021. But what I'd like to point out is the author, the the the first author of this study. So, Waldius. And if I'm mispronouncing that, apologies. But, Waldius. That's how I'm pronouncing it. And the reason I'm raising that is because if we look at, fortunately the lab test report includes the data that they use to come up with their reference ranges. So for example, for APO a one, they use this study here which incidentally has the same first author. But what's different from their citation and the citation that I just used is they use the citation from 2004 whereas the data that I used was more recent 2021. So that's just one part of the story even though it's the same first author that that wrote both studies. So, after that 2004 study was published, at some point, Quest used it to derive its APO a one reference range. Now, what's also interesting is note that the paper links the Amoris study. And the study that I referenced on the last slide is also the Amoris study. So in other words, they used, early data from the Amoris study to inform their APO a one reference range. But eighteen up to seventeen years later, 2004 to 2021 when the paper was published, there was more recent data. So, I'd argue that the reference range at least for Quest should be updated with the more recent Amoris Amoris data from that I just showed. Alright. So moving past that story, back to the data. So glucose at 91, this is close to my average since 2015. So close to 60 tests of ninety milligrams per deciliter. So that's relatively good news. Also, in the optimal range, 80 to 94. Creatinine at point seven six is good news. As creatinine levels increase during aging and I know that there there are those who will say, well creatinine's proportional muscle mass, I don't think I lost a ton of muscle mass over the past six weeks since the last test. And we're considering that creatinine levels increase during aging, it's better to have them on the lower side. And with that in mind, my 59 test creatinine average since 2015 is point nine four milligrams per deciliter. So, that it's on the lower side of of my range is good news. But this is just one marker of kidney function. Let's take a look at others. So, on to page three. So first, highlighting Cystatin C. And Cystatin C may be a better sorry, better biomarker relative to creatinine as it's less sensitive to changes in muscle mass. So for this test, I was at point seven nine milligrams per liter which isn't terribly high, but note that there is published data that less than point seven is associated with lowest risk of death for all causes. And again, that's on the Patreon tier if you wanna see that data. So kidney function is relatively good but I wanna, improve my Cystatin C level. Another for another reason, it's included as a component of GrimAge which is the best epigenetic clock for, evaluating all cause mortality risk. And I'll have that in a future video. Alright. So, onto liver function or liver health and function. AST and ALT values in the high teens, low twenties are optimal. Both of these data moved slightly in the wrong direction away from that relative to the last test. And with that in mind, I took I had GGTN which was 12 for test number one which is good and you it's relatively youthful and associated with low, all cause mortality risk. So I took it out based on that, but knowing that my AST and ALT went up a bit from the last test, and I did change my diet as we'll see in the next video on in this series, I'm gonna reintroduce GGT to see if that moved too in conjunction with the changes for AST and ALT. But there are other biomarkers that can be linked with liver health and function that suggests that liver health and function in my case is generally good. And one of those is albumin. We can see that it's relatively high at 5.4. And even though the lab flagged it note that albumin levels decline during aging, relatively higher levels even in centenarians is associated with a reduced all cause mortality risk. Now, as a side note, some may say, well, if it's if you're dehydrated dehydrated then your album albumin levels can be high or higher than they should be. So if I if I was dehydrated before this test, we'd expect not just albumin to be high, but all of my biomarkers. I mean, glucose would be higher than my, you know, almost 60 test average, or any of the other biomarkers on this sheet would be higher and that's not what we see. Most of the data is within their usual ranges test to test. And to confirm that, I'll link the data to test number one and you can see that the majority of these biomarkers are similar to where they were for the first test in 2025. As one example of that note, Alkaline Phosphatase also, which can also be linked with liver health and function, although it can also come from bone and intestine, is on the lower side which it has been for many tests at 41. So, collectively, these four biomarkers suggest good liver health and function in my case. Alright. So, next up is Hemoglobin H one C. I wish I wish that they would put it right below glucose in lab report, but unfortunately, they don't. So 5.3 isn't terribly high, but it increases during aging, and I've had lower value since 2015, but I've only measured it a handful of times. With that in mind, I'm gonna include it for every test as the goal is to keep it right at five to 5.1, which is where I've had it in the past. Not 5.3 or or 5.4 even which I think is where it was for the first test in 2025. But then the weakest spot, weakest data of all my blood test data is my thyroid hormones. And for those who don't know, I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my twenties. So I've been taking Levothyroxine for the majority of probably by half my life. So if you look at the free t four and free t three, if you look at the ratio, sorry, between free t three and free t four, minus point one eight. Now, that ratio declines during aging. The conversion of f t four into f t three gets worse during aging thereby leading to a lower ratio. F t three is the active form of thyroid hormones, so we want that to be relatively high, and f t four to be relatively low. But in my case, that corresponding ratio is very low. To put that into context, the average value in 90 year olds is better than my point one eight. So not only is this data worse than expected for chronological age, it's older than expected based on my chronological age. So with that in mind, I've been scurrying trying to get doctors and endocrinologist and my PCP to change my thyroid prescription from t four, Levothyroxine, which clearly I'm not converting well for whatever reason whether that's aging or something else. I don't know. And fortunately, I was able to make some progress progress with that. So, we recently modified my thyroid medications so that now I'm taking less t four, and I've added a small amount of t three in, and we'll see how, if, or how that impacts these thyroid biomarkers, f t four and f t three for the April 22 test. Alright. I'm also tracking IGG, as IGG levels increase during aging, and interventions that reduce it are associated with an increased lifespan span like calorie restriction, exercise training, and parabiosis. Now, what's optimal is very difficult to define at least for me right now because the date the aging data, there aren't epidemiological studies of millions of people that have looked at IGG as this is not on a standard blood test report. And I have yet to come across all cause mortality data for IGG in very large studies, not in studies of a few 100 people. So with that in mind, I'm planning on measuring IGG at every test going forward, and collecting enough data where I can look at correlations for IGG versus other biomarkers. And then, in my case, is 1,100 relatively higher associated with more biomarkers going the right direction versus wrong? Or should it be somewhere nine nine hundred or thousand? So stay tuned for that analysis, but I'm a it's gonna take some time to collect enough IGG data. And then, white blood cells which the lab, correctly flagged as low at 3.2, and it doesn't go into the data here but we'll see that on the next page. Why I agree with the lab, the labs reference range as 3.2 being low. A high point is Hemoglobin or I shouldn't say high point, but good news is Hemoglobin at 15.2. My 55 test average since 2015 is 15 grams per deciliter. Now, that's good news because hemoglobin levels decline during aging. And if you saw my video on cancer cachexia, that may be an an important biomarker in the early stages of of cancer cachexia where hemoglobin levels are low. So I don't know if that can be a diagnostic biomarker for avoiding cancer, but I'd like to keep my hemoglobin levels relatively high and avoid any any age related decline. Now, with that in mind, over eight tests in 2024, that average for hemoglobin was 14.8. Now, you might think, oh, 50, you know, 55 test average is 15 and then 14.8, not a big deal. You're not you're worried about nothing. But isn't that how is that how aging starts? It's 15, next year's 14.8, maybe 2025 it'd be 14.6 average, 14.4. Ten years later, maybe now it's an average of 13.8. Right? And if I hadn't been tracking it, maybe I would just be on that age related decline for hemoglobin and all the functional adverse functional consequences that come with it like an insufficient oxygen carrying capacity in blood. So with that in mind, that I've been able to get it back to 15.2 at least for this one test, suggests that it it it is continuing to be malleable, and I can keep it relatively high. Also, good news is the MCV, so the Mean Corpuscular Volume. This is the average red blood cell volume. How big are your red blood cells? MCV increases during aging and over the past couple tests, they've trended higher towards 93. So So this is good news that I've been able to get them back closer to the lower end of my range which is 91. Alright. On to page four of the report where we can see the RDW. This is the variability in red blood cell size. So do you have red blood cells that are mostly all the same size or a mix of small, medium and large? If they're a mix of small, medium and large, that's a higher RDW which RDW increases during aging and higher levels are associated with an increased all cause mortality risk. The RDW is also the major predictor of Levine's biological age test. So in my case, we can see that 11.8 is relatively low and good news. So now, for the white blood cell breakdown. So, what's optimal for neutrophils is 2,000 to 3,000. Now, I'm below that and that's potentially bad news because less than 2,000 is associated with an increased all cause mortality risk. Now, if I'm gonna be below or out of the range, the optimal range for any of the white blood cell counts, I'd be okay with neutrophils being on the lower side of the range because they increase during aging. On the other hand, lymphocytes decline during aging, and this is actually now my worst, my lowest lymphocyte level reading since 20 since I started tracking in 2015. 55 tests. Now, lymphocytes decline during aging. So this is more bad news. Now, but also, is it that this is an age related decline or there's something that I'm doing in my diet that may be good for the majority of other biomarkers but bad for lymphocytes. So, without going into that story yet, note that lymphocytes in agreement with the published data, in my case too, have declined during aging. So we've got lymphocyte levels on the y axis plotted against chronological age, and we can see that significant inverse correlation with as the correlation coefficient is negative 0.51, and we can see that the p value is far below 0.05. So here, my data agrees with the published literature. Now, where the story gets interesting and this brings back that HDL that, story that I mentioned earlier, is that lymphocytes are inversely correlated with my HDL. And usually, the published data Well, granted, how lymphocytes changing during aging, in my case, agrees with the published data at least for now until I'm able to reverse this. But generally, my data doesn't agree with the published data. I'm usually an outlier. And there is published data that higher HDL is significantly associated with lower lymphocytes. And that's what we'll see here too in my data. So over those 55 tests And again, note that we've got lymphocytes on the y axis plotted against now HDL on the x. There is a significant inverse correlation in my data over those 55 tests for higher HDL with lower lymphocytes. So what does that mean? What does that translate into? What am I gonna do with this this information? Well, the optimal range for HDL is 50 to 60 at least for men. Again, the date the data is a bit wider range for women. When considering that my latest test was 67 which is outside of that range, I'm planning on reducing HDL to the mid to lower fifties. So getting my HDL data now within optimal. And if we go based on extrapolation of the trend line, I should expect to see lymphocyte levels that are closer to 1,800. Now, it's not 2,000 but I'll be able I'd be working on optimizing two biomarkers getting them closer to their optimal ranges or one optimal and the other closer to optimal. Whereas, I've got one far from optimal lymphocytes and the other outside of optimal too. So, what's the lowest shape of the u shaped curve for minimizing risk for both for both biomarkers? That's the plan. So how will I do that? I'll have some of that story in the diet video that that will come probably next week, but I've already detailed that story on Patreon. So if you're interested, check it out. Alright. So two more biomarkers to go through. DHEA sulfate which declines during aging, and note that DHEA sulfate is in the testosterone realm. Right? So it's an androgen. My testosterone levels are generally high 800 to 900. But my DHEA levels may have declined during aging. I had two values about twenty years ago that were a 300, but I don't know if I was supplementing with DHEA if that caused it or not. And if it was, I don't know what my normal levels for DHEA are, whether DHEA sulfate are, whether they're around one thirty six back then or not. Now, with that in mind and knowing that DHEA sulfate declines during aging, over the past three years and over 20 tests, my average DHEA sulfate level is a 126. So that I'm able to keep it on the higher end of my range, one thirty six for at least this test is good news as it helps me resist age related, it's age related decline. And last but not least is another weak spot, Candida I G G. For whatever reason, my immune system is having to work harder than it should to keep Candida I G G level or Candida levels somewhere in my body in check. And interestingly, I made a bunch of dietary changes prior to this test with the goal of reducing systemic Candida levels but that clearly didn't make a difference as 1.2. And I wish that that was in grams per liter or some units. You know, these are in arbitrary units. They have no units. It's just 1.2. How do I translate into an actual value that I can compare with total IGG? I can't. If anybody has insight on how to do that for Candida IGG, please leave a comment. I'd be grateful for that information. So 1.2 is actually one of the highest values that I've had for Candida IGG. So I'm still working on things that I can include in my diet that can, consistently keep that on the lower side or below the the labs reference range. Alright. So what I haven't yet gotten into is what diet and supplements correspond to this 22 year younger biological age. And it takes me a few days to put these videos together so the plan is to have it a week from today. Alright. That's all for now.
