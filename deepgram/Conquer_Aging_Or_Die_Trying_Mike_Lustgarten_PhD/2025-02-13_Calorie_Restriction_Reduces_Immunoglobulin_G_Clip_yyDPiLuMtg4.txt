People are trying to develop the more antiaging interventions. So far, the calorie restriction is the most efficient way for aging intervention intervention across different species. In this famous experiment at a did a by a scientist from Wisconsin Madison researchers that, they put monkeys under calorie restriction over twenty years. And then they found really interesting. The monkeys under calorie restriction over their lifetime do look much better on the age. I look at it further. So they they claim that calorie restriction can increase higher span. So we also adopt a calorie restriction to see if IgG is an agent with this the factor. Does it change by, in during calorie restriction? There's something really surprising to us happened here. We found that when we put the mice under calorie restriction, that it specifically decreased IgG without affecting IgA or IgM or other antibody acid types, meaning that IgG is specifically regulated by this, by calorie restriction. So basically, in a plasma, IgG would drop to decrease over 50%, and it was even more pronounced in a depot tissue by calorie restriction. So further make us believe there is a connection of immunoglobulin and the agent.
