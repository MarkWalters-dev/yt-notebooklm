In an earlier video, we saw that grape seed proanthocyanidins increase NAD. In this study, which was done in rats, we can see that the highest proanthocyanidin content of fifty milligrams per kilogram increased liver levels of NAD by about four fold. Similarly, in a study that was done in middle aged mice, 18 old, 18. When these mice were fed grape seed proanthocyanidin extract, GSPE, We can see about a three fold increase for plasma levels of NAD. However, no human studies have yet tested the ability of grape seed proanthocyanidins to impact NAD levels. So with that in mind, for NAD test number six, I sent blood to Ginfinity for analysis. And if you're interested in measuring your own levels of NAD, there'll be a discount link in the video's description. So there, the hypothesis was if I supplement with grape seed powder as a source of proanthocyanidins, will that raise my NAD? And I wish I could say that it could or did, but it didn't. Grape seed powder did not raise my NAD. As we can see, 19.9 micromolar is my lowest NAD reading over the over these six tests. Now, to to note how much grape seed powder that I was taking, it was six point one grams per day and I did this experiment for nineteen days. Note that in the last video, I showed published amounts of grape seed proanthocyanin content in grape seeds. And based on the lowest amount which is about a hundred and seven milligrams per grams of grape seed, I took in about six hundred and forty eight milligrams of proanthocyanidins at the lowest. It could be higher but that's based on published values for how much is in grape seed. Now, just using the rat study as an example, the human equivalent dose for that study for that four fold increase in NAD was about five hundred and thirty six milligrams of grape seed parenthocyanidins. So technically, I should have at least seen some bump or some increase in NAD but I didn't. So with that in mind, what's next? I've used NMN in the past, but for the next test, I'm gonna use niacin. And why I'm gonna go with niacin besides cost? I'll cover that in a future video. Alright. That's all for now.

And before you go, we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at home metabolomics, NAD quantification, green tea, epigenetic testing, and telomere testing which is also included in that test, oral microbiome composition, at home blood testing with Scifox Health, and note that their biomarker panel is mostly different from the at home metabolomics and also includes a APOB, diet tracking, or if you'd like to support the channel, you can do that with the website, buy me a coffee. We've also got merch. So if you're interested in wearing the Conquer Aging or diet tracking brand, that link and all the other links will be in the video's description. Thanks for watching. I hope that you enjoyed the video. Have a great day.
