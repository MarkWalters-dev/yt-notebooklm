But we can shift from from the kidney now to liver. So albumin would be mostly a marker of liver health and function. Okay. I mean, anything you wanna see specifically, I can I can pull up? So So, wait. So this is good news. So albumin declines during aging. You've got it going in the right direction, pretty close to optimal. That's, like, what, four point well, 4.5 ish current values? Roughly around there. Yeah. Yeah. And you've got that, yeah, 4.5 to eight, I think. So, yeah, right now so, yeah, you've moved this in the right direction. I mean, that's good. That's great news. So albumin is probably the most underrated biomarker, at least my perspective. So I've mentioned this in other places, but when you think about the concentration of albumin, you see it on the y axis. It's in grams per deciliter. Right? So your value of 4.5 grams is 4,500 milligrams per deciliter. So most people are hot on glucose or lipoproteins. Even the best glucose, 80 milligrams per deciliter. So now you've got albumin, 4,500 milligrams per deciliter versus glucose, 80 milligrams per deciliter. Albumin just based on concentration is six and a half times higher based on concentration in blood. So, okay, total cholesterol, 200 milligrams per deciliter versus, sorry. I said 4,500 versus 80. That's sixty sixty five times higher. Right? If I'm doing if my math is math if I'm math incorrectly. Don't look at me. I I don't do math in my head anymore. Yeah. I I gotta I'm I'm maybe off by a factor of 10. Let me just yeah. It's 60 fold higher. Same thing same thing for, total cholesterol. 200 milligrams per deciliter versus 4,500 milligrams per deciliter. So albumin is more concentrated than both of those. Now where it gets tricky in that in that, interpretation is that albumin is a big protein. Right? So you have to factor in its molecular weight. And when you do that, it's basically a big tree floating in the forest, and obviously, there's more glucose and lipoproteins in blood, but it's a giant tree floating around that most people don't think anything about. So, keeping it relatively high and avoiding that age related decline, top tier in my eyes. We we've got some bad ones. My bilirubin is supposed to be stable with aging, but it looks like it's on the decline. Yeah. So that can go in two two ways. Right? So to interpret it in two ways. One is that lower levels are found in youth, and they increase during aging. And and centenarians actually have relatively higher levels of bilirubin. Like, you know, we're talking double where your levels are. And, so then the question is, do you wanna have them higher or lower lower knowing that centenarians have higher levels? But bilirubin can act as an antioxidant. So I think in centenarians, it's more of a compensatory mechanism where, you know, their antioxidant defense enzymes may not be good. So they've gotta increase bilirubin levels by degrading red blood cells and degrading degrading hemoglobin. So it I'd say lower is better and keeping it low indefinitely is better and avoiding the age related increase. So this is good news that it's moved in the right direction. Yeah. Yeah. I was gonna say the fact that I'm, you know, decreasing, at least I'm heading into my my optimal and within the reference ranges because I was way outside of the reference range previously. Yeah. That suggests you had some oxidative stress going on. That that would be my interpretation. Some oxidative stress going on with the very high bilirubin's. What was triggering it, though? I mean, that's the billion dollar question. Yeah. And then what have you done to reduce it? Right? Also, billion dollar question. Again, I don't think that was one I was targeting specifically. Mhmm. Oh, the the things that you're seeing here are side effects from other things that I was targeting. Is there a way to go back and see, like because you could see that there's a cut point. Right? Like, where it was Right there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Whatever you did there, it shifted the balance. Yeah. And I wish I could tell you exactly when that was. I guess I can go back to the raw data and take a look. Yeah. So we're looking for oh, gosh. Well, it looks like it's around twenty twenty one. So bilirubin. It's probably right in front of my face. Oh, I think there you go. Bilirubin. I'm sorry. I got I have to zoom out just so I can see more of the, more of the ranges here. So let me get into 2021. So 2020. Yeah. 29, 04. Yeah. So it was probably right around between no. It's '20 yeah. 2020. So it looks like I was in the twos and the 1.7 in 2020. And then around November 2020, I dropped down to 0.9, and then it looks like it consistently stayed lower. Were there supplements or HBOT or red light, some therapy or something that you did that started in 2021? Again, I've got the data. It would be it would be tabs that I would have to go drill down into and and really go investigate. Not now. If you wanna do that, like, part Right. That would that would take us forever. I don't think people have patience for that. Part part three and part four if you want it to be feel like digging into your own data. You know? Yeah. So, again, I mean, this is really the first time I'm seeing these graphs right right now with you. I was working on the generation of them all up until this point. So, this is all new to me as it is, you know, as my data is to you. We're looking at it. So Nice. Alright. So let's go back to liver. Let's, like, AST, ALT, and GGT if you have it. Okay. So here's, AST, ALP. Which one would you like to look at first? Oh, AST, ALT. We'll we'll check out a l ALP too. Ah, so you have GGT that way. Do you have a a l t? If you scroll up a little bit, is that one of the plots? It it is on here. It's just probably off the screen. So let me, minimize here again. ALT. Yeah. ALT is right there. There we go. Yeah. Right there. Alright. So, yeah, moving moving moving in the right direction. Values in the high teens, low twenties associated with lowest all cause mortality risk. I mean, here too, data moving in the right direction. So, the biggest question is what did you do? You know? Yeah. And I wish I had, like, done that research that I could tell you on this pod. So Yeah. But I, you know, couldn't tell you right now. Alright. Good news nonetheless. Alright. So AST, I'm guessing we'll see a similar trend for AST. There we go. AST. Alright. Same same direction. Yeah. Wait. So still a bit high, though. Most most recent tests are in the thirties. Right? High thirties, 35. Yeah. We gotta get that low. Way out of the reference range here for most of these. So I'm now in the reference range, and I'm getting back into my very little, very narrow optimal range. Yeah. Yeah. Most recent tests are still relatively high, though. Yeah. So there is at least one paper where GGT was compared against AST and ALT for, liver disease related mortality. And GGT was, like, the highest GGT levels. The highest ten percent GGT was associated with an eightfold higher risk of death from liver disease mortality, whereas the highest AST and ALT was like a fourfold higher risk. So that suggests that GGT when it's high is a better marker of liver disease mortality risk. So it in your case, let well, less than 12 is associated with lowest risk, all cause mortality risk, very large study, 16,000,000 people. So your GGT data is fantastic. I mean, even where you started 12/1975, that trend I mean, you have a few data points above that, but Yeah. Lower is better for GGT. So, you know, it suggests that, your liver health is good, but something's triggering your AST to be high. It could be supplements. I I don't know what. You know? It's the liver, you know, is is, detox you know, phase c detoxification. So it could be that something is triggering that and causing some liver damage. But the good news is that GGT is low, which could be a better marker. More recently, I've been experimenting a little with TUDCA, so that might be helping some of these values. Or as I continue, it might help with some of these values. Yeah. I don't know enough about it. I I think it's involved with, like, cholestasis, so people who have cholesterol buildup in the liver and then liver dysfunction. But I don't know. Maybe it's a different, bile acid that I'm thinking of that you can take as a supplement. I'm gonna have to look into TUDCA, t u d c a. Mhmm. Toro usodeoxycholic acid. Oh, wow. Okay. Oh, man. I had no idea what it's good for. I do. Alright. You must be a doctor or something. Right. So ALP ALP is moving in the wrong direction. I don't know that it increases during aging because the studies that I've I've come across, it's it's variable where it's generally flat. But there aren't very large epidemiological studies, like, for a lot of the other biomarkers to make a an accurate assessment if it increases during aging or not. But all cause mortality risk above 48, it is associated with higher risk. So, I mean, you're just outside that. It's not too far away from optimal, and moving well, but moving in the wrong direction. Yeah. But you had very low levels. I mean, that's just amazing. I I don't think I've seen ALP levels as low as thirty, thirty two. So, again, I would be curious to see what, you know, what happened again in this time frame where things were low and then they went high, then they went low. Oh, yeah. That high. And then the that split that I don't know if this split is as dramatic because I can't see the the dates as well on the bottom. Yeah. They're too bunched up. Yeah. But is is that split where you know, granted, in this case, it's a few data points that were lower and then a lot more that are variable. Is that 2020 versus 2021 again? Yeah. We got zeros showing here and ones up at the top. So, this would be right at the end of 2020 and all through 2021. But then but then they increase. You get them decreasing for a lot of tests, and then they're increasing again. It's back at 2023, 2024. They went high again, and they're working back down again for 2025. So, yeah, I'm at a loss to account for why that is. Yeah. I mean, that's a big part of what I do is trying to figure out what moves what to try to you know? That's the biggest challenge without tracking without tracking you know? I mean, that's something we could look into. Right? Which is, like, do you have variability in your supplements? Like, you'll take a list of supplements Not typically. No. The the biggest variability that's in my life is whether I'm running or training for a marathon or not. But the supplements in terms of the amounts stable from test to test? Generally. Yeah. Interesting. So so so you think some of this is related to marathon training volume? Oh, I have no clue. I'm just I'm just grasping at straws at this point because that's just one major factor that I know that changes a lot. To to think to address that, you've been tracking I mean, how long have you you've been wearing Whoop? Oh, yeah. For, gosh. Probably I'm thinking not quite ten years maybe. Wow. So I don't know if it's been that long. Maybe So a long time, which could correlate we could correlate, the average daily heart rate, which is in the export, And we could see, you know, basically so you have when you did each of these tests. So we could take the average daily heart rate in between, you know, so say day one, day 50. Now we have fifty days average daily heart rate in between tests. That lines up with the latter test. So each test would have would have an average daily heart rate, and then we could see is is average daily heart rate which biomarkers is average daily heart rate associated with going in the wrong direction for biomarkers and right direction? In other words, high training volumes may positively impact some biomarkers, but not others. And then do we get to the bigger question? And I'm not trying to modify your training training volume, but it could suggest an optimal training volume to try to get more biomarkers moving in the right direction versus wrong. So a big light bulb just came on for my in my brain, because as I'm looking at my own data, trying to figure out, like, what was my life doing at that time. So prior to 2020, yeah, this might make some sense. I was, still taking care of my parents. So I was still forced to, you know, eat a lot of their food. I was not eating my own food, like the grass fed meats, you know, just cleaner, which, you know, shouldn't really account for these things going up. But I also became became more intentional with my supplementation. So, I'm thinking that possibly it's when I did begin, my full court press on supplementation. So 2020 versus 2021 for that. But then that wouldn't that wouldn't explain the increase from, you know, 2022 up. Like, you see, it's it's pretty low for, like, 10 tests, and then there's a trend for it to go for the most recent, say, 15 tests. Like, it would go up. Yeah. So there was a lot of experimentation with my supplements throughout that that time. So it's it's more most likely a supplement that was causing the changes. Yeah. So that too. Like, if if you if we took the average supplement intake or even, you know, if this if you have a core list of supplements that doesn't change test to test and you know only which supplements that you've added in or taken out for a period, and then, you know, having that lined up for every test, I know it's a lot of work. It's probably something you don't wanna do, but that might get closer to what might be impacting what. Additionally, I was also working on my hormones at that point. So I was trying to get my thyroid, dialed in. So there was a lot of thyroid medication changes throughout that time. So, I mean, there's confounding variables upon count founding variables here.
