So we know that during age that our metabolic metabolic rate decrease. So in this, mice with, with the prevention of IT accumulation, they can maintain higher level of oxygen consumption, meaning they can have a higher level of metabolic rate. They are protected from obesity. And, also, in aging, we have we we we develop insulin resistance that, lead to the type two diabetes. In this mice, at 15 old, these mice are still very healthy. They are very insulin sensitive. They can clear glucose much more efficient from their blood. Also, once we keep the mice, let let the natural die, we notice that, indeed, they actually have a prolonged lifespan over 12 person percentage. So this top percentage is a is pretty significant in in mice. So to to put this together that preventing IgE accumulation extends both health span and the lifespan. So this story being published, about one year ago in cell metabolism. So we found that IgG accumulated, in since the early aging, very early, equal to about 30 years old in humans, preferably adipose tissue. In there, it's active macrophage called adipose tissue pathogenic remodeling and then impairment. Once we prevent the aggregation, we can increase the lifespan and lifespan. We are so happy to see that, about two months ago, that there, the study come out from from a cell that they use state of the art technology, did a, bio comprehensive analysis across different species. They reproduced our findings that IgG is the aging factor that caused the senescence. They also found the reproduce our findings that once we intervene at the accumulation, we can improve aging. So we are so happy to see that our findings are reproduced.
