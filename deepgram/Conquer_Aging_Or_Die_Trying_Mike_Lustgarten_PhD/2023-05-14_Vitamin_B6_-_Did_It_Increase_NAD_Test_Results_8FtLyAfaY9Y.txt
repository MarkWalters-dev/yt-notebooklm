Vitamin b six. Did it impact NAD? In an earlier video, we saw that tryptophan is converted by the de novo NAD synthesis pathway, as shown here, into NAD. But an age related decline for vitamin b six, otherwise known as pyridoxal five phosphate or PLP, may limit conversion of tryptophan into NAD. So with that in mind, if I increase vitamin b six intake, will intracellular levels of NAD correspondingly increase? So with that in mind, for NAD test number four on April 24, I sent blood samples to GINFINITY and there we can see that my NAD levels were 30.1 Now, to put that into context for GINFINITY's ranges, we can see that that would qualify me as suboptimal, but that doesn't answer the question of whether B6 made an impact. Moreover, it doesn't address whether NAD of an NAD of thirty one thirty point one is progress or just normal variation so to address that let's take a look at how 30 compares with the data for tests one, two, and three so for test number one on January 23 my intracellular level of NAD was 25.6 and note that I wasn't taking NR or NMN, but because I tracked my diet every day with weighing all of my food, I know my average B6 intake for the thirty day period prior to this test was three point two milligrams of B6 per day, and similarly, my average niacin intake for the thirty day period prior to this test was forty two milligrams per day. Now note that both of these are at least two times higher than the RDA so I was surprised to see that my NAD levels were relatively low. So after getting these test results, about a week later, I started supplementing with NMN. So for the twenty one day period prior to test number two, I averaged three hundred milligrams of NMN per day, but still no impact on my NAD level. So I think it's fair to say that somewhere around the 25 range, even with three hundred milligrams of NMN, is my baseline level of intracellular NAD. And note that B6 and niacin were similar to the first test, three point two mg per day and forty one point seven mg per day for the twenty one day period prior to test number two. So after getting the results for test number two, about a week later, I started supplementing with an even higher dose of NMN, one thousand milligrams per day or one gram per day for the seven day period that preceded test number three on March 6. And there, I finally saw progress with an intracellular NAD level of 39.3 micromolar. Note this effect is probably specific to NMN because my B6 intake was the same as it was for the other test and niacin was in the same ballpark too, 41.5. So for test number four, I removed NMN to do the B6 experiment and we can see that my average B6 intake for the forty nine day period from test number three to the day before test number four was about three to four four fold higher. So from three point two milligrams per day average to eleven point three milligrams per day average for vitamin B6. More specifically, for the fourteen day period before the test, I increased it even a little bit further. So it's about five fold higher as you can see there, 15.6 average B6 intake before test number four. With these data in mind, note that niacin was still in the ballpark, and I saw that 30.1 micromolar level for intracellular levels of NAD. When considering that my baseline NAD is about 25 micromolar, 30 is progress, so I think it's fair to say, even though it's just one test, that there was some small increase for NAD with vitamin B6 supplementation. Now, if this is a real effect, if I go higher, I'd expect to see a further increase for NAD, so that's the plan for test number five coming up relatively soon. Will going higher for vitamin B6 more than thirty milligrams per day, so I'm going to double it above my current intake, which would be 10 times higher than where I was for test number three. Will that further increase NAD? So stay tuned for that video at some point in the future. Alright. That's all for now.
