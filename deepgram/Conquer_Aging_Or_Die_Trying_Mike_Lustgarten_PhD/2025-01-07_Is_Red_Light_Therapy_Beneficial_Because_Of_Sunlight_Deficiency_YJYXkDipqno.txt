You are absolutely right to say, well, look. We're all you know, the mice, they're in rooms with LED lighting and all the rest of it. Even worse, the foundation of a lot of medical experiments is done on tissue in in in in tissue incubators. So they they're in the dark to kick off with. And then when they do come out, they're under hard LED lighting. So I did suggest to a few people here that first of all, they put a twelve twelve, daylight bulb in their tissue incubators. And it caused quite a ruffle because the the experiments were coming out rather differently. So that's I don't wanna cause too much trouble. I'll be really happy to go to the grave if we can just change the light bulbs for us as public health. But when you think of the vast amount of science that's actually done or based on tissue culture experiments fundamentally in the dark and then just taken out occasionally under harsh blue light, that's not the way bodies work.
