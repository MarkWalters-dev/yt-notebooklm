Even if someone's got relatively high lipoprotein a, 75, 80, nanomolar or more, having h s CRP less than two milligrams per liter, not point two, that, essentially, the, CHD mortality risk goes away. So but if you've got high HSCRP, the risk increases based on CHD risk based on lipoprotein a, and then also the waist to hip ratio. So when waist to hip ratio is less than point nine three, it's not associated with an increased risk of lipoprotein a associated CBD outcomes. But for people who had a waist to hip hip ratio greater than one, and I've got a video coming on actually, I released it today. Mhmm. It it's on YouTube today. But But, but so for people who have a waist to hip ratio greater than one, lipoprotein a higher than 50 milligrams per deciliter, which would be a 125 nanomolar, way off the charts compared to you the three of you guys. That's associated with an increased CBD more mortality, outcome risk. Whereas people with lipoprotein a less than 50 milligrams per deciliter and a 125 nanomolar with a waist to hip ratio less than point nine three, no association with CBD mortality, related outcomes. So there may be, for people who have hot relatively high lipoprotein a, ways to modulate that risk by keeping inflammation low and waist to hip ratio low.
