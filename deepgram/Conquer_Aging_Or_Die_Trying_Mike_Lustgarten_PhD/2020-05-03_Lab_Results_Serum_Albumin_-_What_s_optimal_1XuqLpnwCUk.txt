Alright. So let's start with albumin. And and I'm gonna go through every one of the nine variables, on the list. And I wanna mention that, obviously, for the for the sake of time, there's no possible way I can go through every study from each variable. So for the point of brevity, I I'm gonna focus on the, biggest studies that have, enrolled the largest amounts of subjects. These would have more, statistical power to identify meaningful correlations and associations when compared with studies that may have a few 100 or or or a few thousand subjects. For example, here in the in this albumin study, this is a sample size that included more than 1,000,000 subjects. So okay. The reference range for albumin is thirty five to fifty grams per liter. But what's optimal? So higher albumin levels are associated with biological youth. We can see that here. So we're looking at albumin levels on the y axis versus age. And, we can see the female plot, and then we can see the male plot. So males tend to have, higher albumin up until about 60 or 65, than females. So what about risk of death, for all cause? Actually, before we go there. So yeah. And then going forward, you can see that albumin very clearly decreases, with age for both sexes. So what about all cause mortality? All cause mortality risk. So this is, again, a big study, one point seven million subjects. And we're looking at female mortality ratios on on on this side and then male mortality ratios on that side. And then the x axis goes from higher albumin levels to lower albumin levels. So how we translate this is higher albumin here, so it would be greater than, 45. I have it as I have it in milligrams per deciliter. I didn't convert it back, but it's the same. So, four point five milligrams per deciliter or forty five grams per liter in men. And for women, greater than 44, would be associated with the lowest risk of death for all causes. And then each of these different data points, are for different age groups. So men less than 50, men or women less than 50, 50 to 69 years old, and greater than 70. So what we can see is that as albumin levels, decrease, risk of death for all causes increases for both sexes. So can albumin levels be optimized? So, I first started tracking all of my blood stuff, fifteen years ago, and at that time, it was only about once a year. I didn't really understand the importance, of, testing more off more often back then. So based on those approximately once a year measurements for for about ten years in my thirties, my average albumin level is four four point seven four, milligrams per deciliter, which translates into, 47. It's it's just the unit difference. But, yeah, it's 47, grams per deciliter. So already, I don't you know, whatever I was doing at that time, you know, I was already, off the chart, you know, with higher levels being associated with biological youth when I should have been somewhere around here. So whatever I was doing at that time, it was definitely on the right track. But I should say I don't have longevity DNA. The long slip person, long slip man in my family is currently my dad who's 78. Before that, it was his dad who was 67. So I don't have longevity DNA. I wouldn't attribute this to genetics. So then in 2015, I started tracking more often. I started dietary tracking and blood testing four to six times a year. So I have 23 data points now for abdomen in the last five years. And what we can see is that I've been able to increase my abdomen levels from the 4.74 to 4.93. And using using t test, these values are significantly different. So now I'm even higher off the chart than it was before when I should be somewhere here, and there should have been some age related decrease. So I've been able to resist the age related decline, in Albany. So one way I'm doing that is through diet. And when looking at correlations between my diet with, albumin, the strongest correlation is for beta carotene. And so each data point corresponds to, obviously, albumin levels. But then as I mentioned, I tracked my diet so I can look at correlations between my diet with the, biomarker, in this case, being albumin. So the correlation for beta carotene with albumin, is moderately strong about 0.6. Remember, a correlation of one or negative one as close to those extremes as possible is close to as linear as it is a linear correlation, but it it it increases in strength strength as you get closer to one. So, granted, it's not perfect, but it's a moderately strong correlation. So, I shoot for, about five, which is biological youth. And to get there, if you just look go across, you can see that, based on the plot, around sixty thousand micrograms or sixty milligrams of beta carotene should get me there. Now I don't supplement beta carotene. For me, primary sources of beta carotene are carrots, orange sweet potatoes, red bell red bell peppers, spinach, and parsley. So I eat a ton of that stuff to get enough beta carotene to to potentially, keep my albumin levels high.
