This body weight thing is puzzling. It turns out that losing body weight has shorter lifespan. And this is what I mean. Here's here's our body weight curve, and I drew some arrows on top of it to show from six months to about eighteen or twenty months, ad lib mice are gonna gain a certain amount of weight. Each mouse gains more or less weight. Some of them gain a lot. Some of them lose weight, actually. Here's the blue and, you know, here's the 40% CR. They almost all lose weight. So if we look at individual mice and we ask, well, did you lose more weight or gain more weight? And we look across all the intervention groups. The mice that lost weight, the solid line, had shorter lifespans. Lost weight, shorter lifespans. Lost weight. Lost weight. Lost weight. It's not good to lose weight.
