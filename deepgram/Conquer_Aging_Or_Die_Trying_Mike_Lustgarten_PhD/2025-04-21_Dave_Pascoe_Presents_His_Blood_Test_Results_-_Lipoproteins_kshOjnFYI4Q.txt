Implemented this last night too, by the way. Nice. So l d we want to just see LDL. Right? Yeah. Or do or APOB, would that be there? APOB? Sure. Yeah. Let's just go up and do that first. There we go. It will be generated. Yeah. So let's see here. So what is that? 87. So it's your trend line is around average is around 87. Yeah. Way out of my optimal because there's my optimal down here. Yeah. So the optimal is a tricky one. So when I look and I mentioned this in my, most recent video, or maybe it's not out yet. I don't know. I can't remember. But, it's coming out this Sunday if I if it's not out there yet. But so APOB, the reference range is, I think it's less than one fifteen. And then Quest has the reference that they use to determine that, as their reference range. And it's a study from 2004 by a, scientist named Waldius. So, you know, I'm always doing deep dives in the literature, trying to figure out what's the most recent data because, you know, if the reference range is just behind the times. Like, it takes them forever to update their ranges based on the newest the newest and, you know, best literature. So Looks like life extension has it here as one zero nine. That's too high too. So so that study in 2004 was the Amoris study by Waldius, and it just so happens that I ended up finding that same study, which was a longitudinal study published in 2021. So the Quest that QUEST used that paper from one of the earlier studies of the Amora study in following people who ended up getting cardiovascular disease in a very short time, up to 2004, but then the rest of the cohort was followed for another seventeen years. So, you know, same sample size, but a longer follow-up. And the longer follow-up tells you something about, you know, so longer follow ups are generally better than a smaller follow-up. Right? Because if more people are getting heart disease and dying within four years, then probably they were pretty sick to start with versus the longer follow-up is, you know, you've got, more likely to have people who are generally healthy, and it takes a longer time for, you know, some of that population to die off. Right? So, anyway, so the same first author, Waldius 2021, a Morris study, Waldius 2004, Quest. So Quest hadn't op updated it based on the newest available information. So from that study, they have an a beautiful plot that's in the video of, APOB levels less than seventy six milligrams per deciliter, lowest risk for having a major adverse cardiovascular event. So, heart attack. I don't remember if it was nonfatal or fatal stroke and, cardiovascular disease mortality. Now above that, risk did increase. MACE risk did increase, but it was still in the quote, unquote green. So you it it isn't just less than seventy six. The the higher end of the quote, unquote green range according to them could be, like, ninety two milligrams per deciliter, but the lowest risk was less than seventy six. So that that's what I'm shooting for. Oh, no. Now you got me curious why I have my, optimal where it is. So let's see. We were just looking at APOB. Let me come back. Reference table. I wanna see why I set it where I did. Probably Peter. Peter Attia is always talking about, like Life life extension said, like, less than 80, less than 60 optimal. My cardiologist said less than 70. I don't know why I have a set. I do. That's interesting. I have a set between fifty two and sixty. So normally, I would have my reasoning in here, and it's missing. So So I I remember you sent me some data where I think you had some small amount of plaque or something along those lines. So in that case, as low as physically possible, I mean, you know, sure, less than 76. But in your, you know, in your case, having some preexisting plaque, I mean, less than 50, whatever the lowest you can get to. But this was so specific, 52 to 60. I don't know why I came up with that. I I got that from somewhere. I just don't know where. No. That's interesting. Oh, well. Okay. HDL. I quit scrolling past it. There we go. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Nice. So '58 is most recent data, trend line up. HDL can decline during aging. I mean, it peaks in youth, and then it comes down in men and then basically stays flat in the low fifties. So, yeah, you've resisted that. That's good news. Yeah. I I've set all of these, yeah, based on my my age. So, like, from from 60 on, what does it do? That's what you see here. So this wouldn't be the same for somebody that's, you know, 50 or 40 or 30. Gotcha. Yeah. So the big question here is what two did you do to get your HDL going in the right direction from low, you know, high forties to, you know, high fifties? Yeah. Right. Royal hand, I can't tell you. I don't know. I'd have to go back and take a look. Yeah. Trichlocytes? Okay. They're actually nice and low. Yeah. It should be. Oh, you've got PSA there too. Oh, yeah. But we can come back. Triglycerides, HCL ratio. I got, so here's my type, triglycerides. Okay. Still low. It could be better. So less than 45, that's associated with lowest heart disease mortality risk. So that's the ideal. I'm not even there yet. I mean but looks like yours are around 60, somewhere around 60. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty good. That's pretty pretty pretty good. It's trending up. Yeah. I mean, very, very mildly. I mean, you know It's a mild loop. Yeah. So then the I guess alright. So then l lipoprotein a, are you measuring lipoprotein a? Trying to figure out why your APO b would be a bit higher closer to 80. Triglycerides continue contribute to APO b, but then, obviously, LDL, lipop lipoprotein a. Yeah. I don't do that very often either. Yeah. But interestingly, in your case, there's a wide range. For most people, it's pretty pretty tight. And, genetically, I put that in quotes, genetically limited. But you can see yours have ranged from 15 to double that, you know, 33. Yeah. That's that's why I typically don't do it because they tell you that it stays pretty flat or pretty consistent. So that's why I haven't tested it. But I can see in my case, it's not very consistent. Yeah. So I'm I I can't figure out if I should only focus on APO b or lipoprotein a because there is some published data suggesting it is more atherogenic than LDL. So does that mean I should be trying to reduce lipoprotein a and APO b? But if I reduce APO b and lipoprotein a is a bit higher than it should be, does it matter? I can't I still don't have a definitive answer on that. No. I'm assuming mine is based on my meat consumption. Mhmm. What do you think about that? So in my key I can in my case, I don't eat meat that often even though I have fish and yogurt every day. So, it's a higher fat intake in my data. I've been able to cut lipoprotein a in half over the past, you know, ten years or so from my highest level. But but By doing by doing what? Just limiting the Higher fat. Higher fat diet. Higher fat. Okay. Yeah. But even there, there's a u shape because if I go too high for fat intake, all the biomarkers start going way too high. Red blood cells go even higher. Hemoglobin goes towards closer to 16. So, you know, I don't wanna optimize lipoprotein a and then send the glucose goes up. So I don't wanna send everything else in the wrong direction. So it's, you know, how much fat can I tolerate my body tolerate before I'm messing up the other stuff? So what kind of stuff are you doing? Avocados and not avocados, but just mostly nuts, like, almonds, walnuts, peanuts, Brazil nuts, occasionally cashews, occasionally sunflower seeds, but the core is like almonds, peanuts, walnuts. Yeah. See, my diet is really high in in nuts and avocado and yeah. So I'm getting a lot of fat. Yeah. Do you know what the approximate like, how much of the percentage of calories of from fat would be your diet composition? Oh, no. There was a time when I was, I was using I think it was called Nutrisense. I think it was it was one of the, CGMs that I was using that I I was putting all my food in and and looking at it. And that was years ago, and I I now I couldn't tell you. I have no idea. Yeah. Probably need to do that again. Yeah. Definitely. Definitely. Alright. Wait. So LDL. Okay. LDL. Trying to figure out where the higher than it should be APOB, it's not coming from triglycerides, so VLDL because your triglycerides are relatively low. Yeah. You've got some room to move down in LDL. And so LDL, probably the most, you know, the most, controversial these days. Right? You know, you have people who post The main match hyper responders and all that stuff. But that's a whole different category. You know what I mean? Like, that's eating no carbs for you know? I don't even wanna wade into those waters. You know? It's it's a whole different a whole different scenario. Right? So but in the average population, there are conflicting epidemiological studies. Do you want your LDL to be closer to light? You know? Some studies suggest even one ninety, one eighty is associated with lowest risk. But so l d LDL follows an inverse u during aging, low in youth, also low in advanced age. So there too, it's like, how would you know if you're youthful or centenarian levels where they're both very low? Right? So Yeah. And then when you consider that there are studies in 80 year olds that have higher LDL, higher total cholesterol, and they have lower all cause mortality risk relative to people who have lower LDL, Well, LDL declines towards the end of life. And, actually, that's another video I've got in progress where, cancer cachexia, lower LDL, and cancer incidence increases during aging. So Oh. If someone's got on even undiagnosed cancer, I'd bet that their LDL is declining for a long time, and they may not even know it. So yeah. So, anyway, so we're considering that. You've got epidemiological studies that haven't adjusted their models for all of the factors that can impact the association for LDL with heart disease or all cause mortality risk. Like, they'll look at the standards, age, sex, BMI, preexisting CBD, but rarely they'll include cancer or liver disease, which can impact LDL. LDL, you know, cholesterol is made by the the lipoproteins are made by the liver. So if you have liver disease as an advanced stage, you'd be less likely to be even put it out into the blood. So, anyway, there's one study that looked at four point seven million people that adjusted for all of that. Cancer cancer diagnosis, CBD, the standards, age, sex, BMI, dementia, liver disease, kidney disease. Like, it was, like, 11 comorbidities. And when they did that, you know, the the, you know, basically, higher is better LDL in association with lowest all cause mortality risk. No. It's not that's not true anymore. And then the optimal range for CHD mortality risk is sixty five to one twenty. So even though technically and that might be where your green air green lines are from. I don't know. Could be? Alright. Let's let's see if I actually have some, some reasoning for that recorded here. So we're looking for I'm sorry. Were we just looking at LDL? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So LDL right there. And then just come over here. And okay. I've got lots it's lots of different reasoning. Some of this was probably taken right out of your video. Yeah. Inverse u. I see that. Yeah. So I got the lowest ACM, one thirty to one eighty. Since one twenty is significant CVS CHD risk. I was setting my high end to one twenty. Yeah. But we're considering you There we go. I got your name right here. Yeah. I believe that's what you have. That that's that's great, Dave. But you've got the the earlier data that didn't adjust for all of the factors that can impact the association for LDL with all cause mortality, where where LDL was one thirty to one eighty lowest risk. Unless it unless it says but but not adjusted for all comorbidities. Yeah. Alright. No worries. So so, anyway, that's where I think a lot of the and I'll probably make a video on this at some point. Just, you know, probably life fires. People are gonna be yelling at me in the comments, but the data is what it is. So but knowing that you have some was it coronary artery calcium, or was it soft plaque? I don't remember in your case. I had, yeah, I could I could probably pull that up. I mean, the visuals, I think, are probably better than anything. So you can see the very little bits of plaque built up here. Yeah. And that's that's the, so I've got calcified versus noncalcified shown here. So you I mean, you do have some minor plaque. Right? So then the question is, does reducing APL b to its lowest level, does that help slow the increase rate of increase over time? Yeah. And all this was new as of in the past few years because I did a coronary calcium CT, about roughly five years ago. And I was, I would say it was about maybe zero, I think, is what it was. And now, I actually had a score, which scared me because that was a big change, I thought, within the last five years. But still super, super low. Right? It's still low. It's just not as low as I would have liked it to have been. Yeah. Zero is what I would have liked it to have been. So So then the question is if you can reduce APOB to, you know, fifty, sixty versus 80, you know, will that slow the progression? That's the big right? That's the question. Yeah.
