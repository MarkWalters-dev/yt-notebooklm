So moving forward, glucose, glucose increases during aging and higher levels are associated with an increased mortality risk. So first starting with, how it changes during age. Large study again, 12,500,000 subjects. We can see that, so glucose levels on the y axis and age on the x. And, women in red, men in blue, we see that, men increase, their glucose levels increase to to about 60 where they somewhat plateau with a further, you know, additional increase towards later life in the eighties. Whereas for women, the the increase is more linear from around 28 or so all the way up to the oldest age here. So you can see that on, you know, that lowers is is better, especially when considering that it, increases during the age. So somewhere around 85, 86 is is found in biological youth. Now that that number is important because if we look at risk of death for all causes, and that's what's shown here. It has a ratio versus the, circulating concentration of glucose levels. So the lowest point of the curve is where lowest risk for all cause mortality would be, and that for that, it's for eighty to ninety four milligrams per deciliter. So notice that below eighty, eighty, milligrams per deciliter, all cause mortality risk is significantly increased. And, also, anything higher than 94 is significantly increased. So, based on this large, dataset, we could suggest the 80 to 94 would be optimal. So resisting the age related increase in glucose. So, again, in looking at my, once a year measurements, from 2005 to 2015, my average blood glucose level is 89. And then, as I've gotten more serious and tracked more often and tracked my diet, it's 87.7. So comparing these two groups of data, they are not different. So I basically resisted the age related change in, glucose levels at least for now. So how's my diet correlated with blood glucose? So, this is actually a strong correlation between, blood glucose levels and my fat intake, total grams of fat per day on the x axis. And the the this correlation is, 0.75, so it's pretty strong. So what it's basically saying or suggesting is that as I eat more fat, my glucose levels go up, which is going in the wrong direction. And fat is not, all just one thing. Fats comprised of monounsaturated fats, polyunsaturated fats, and saturated fats. So they may not all equally affect or be correlated with my glucose levels. So within my fat intake, the correlation between saturated fat with glucose is moderately strong. So that may be driving this association, saturated fat. So, this the easy answer would be maybe to keep my blood glucose low, just eat less saturated fat. But as we see in a couple sides, it may not be that simple. So going forward, c reactive protein, also increases with aging and higher levels are associated with, a higher all cause mortality risk. So the reference range is zero to three milligrams per liter, but that doesn't really tell us which way, you know, the or how much CRP should be in terms of optimal for aging and risk of death for all causes. So, granted, not many studies, giant studies, I mean, millions of subjects have looked at CRP, in terms of aging. The largest that I could find had 1,300 or so subjects, which is still pretty big compared to other studies. But nonetheless, these aren't absolute numbers too because even though it says it's in grams later, the data would back transform log transform and back transform. But the magnitude of the changes is what what's important here. So we're looking at CRP levels for men and women, during aging. So looking at, you know, the various age groups all the way up to 85 or older. We can see that for men, CRP increases more than fivefold. And for women, it increases more than three fold. Now, again, as I mentioned, the reference ranges from zero to three milligrams per depth per liter, but that doesn't tell us what's optimal. It is is a CRP of two just as just as good as a CRP of one or less. So let's have a look at some of that data. So less than three, lower CRP, lower than three, is associated with a lower all cause mortality risk. Can we go lower? So in three studies, less than one milligram per liter was associated with, reduced all cause mortality risk, KCM risk. How about lower than that? Well, in these two studies, point eight six and point eight three milligrams per liter in these two studies. And we we can go even further. Another two studies found point five to point eight may be optimal. But it didn't doesn't doesn't stop there. Four studies, found that, CRP levels less than point three three milligrams per liter were associated with lowest risk of death from all causes. So, from this, we can conclude or, you know, the data suggests that, lower is better for CRP and as close to zero as you can get, maybe optimal. So looking at my diet with CRP, and I have less data for CRP because I just started tracking it, last year. So I think I have eight eight data points, two, four, six I have eight data points. And the strongest correlation, is with my average daily fat intake. So in this case, higher fat intake, total fat intake is correlated with a lower CRP on the y axis. And even going forward within my fat intake, the the correlation between saturated fat actually should be a negative correlation. So it so higher saturated fat intake strongly correlated with a lower CRP in my data. So that would suggest if I eat more saturated fat and I get most of my saturated fat from coconut butter and, cocoa beans and make homemade chocolate with cocoa beans. So that may be a good way to lower CFP at least based on this data, but not so fast. Because if you remember a couple slides ago, higher fat intake and a higher saturated fat intake were associated with higher glucose levels, which should be going in the wrong direction. So these data, illustrate that, you know, that it's a constant trial and error process. You know, anyone who who, you know, professes to say off of one blood test, hey. This is what you should eat. I think that's, you know, spurious. It it's a constant trial and error process. And I've as I mentioned, I have 20 up to 25 blood tests, And I'm still, you know, constantly tweaking my diet to find out what's optimal across the board, not just for one or or two biomarkers. So finding the sweet spot for that is is key.
