I I don't think I've ever heard the thyroid story because I just recently, was able to finally switch get started on switching my meds too for that. So what what was your thyroid So I've been in supplementation probably for the past thirty some years. Yeah. And the endocrinologist that I saw had put me on a very, very high dose of, t four. And when I finally started looking at some of my my thyroid markers, I knew they were out of whack, so I went to see an endocrinologist to argue with her for my change in medication. And one of the first things she well, one of the first things she started arguing with me about when she found out I was a biohacker, was that, you know, my medication was way out of whack, and I shouldn't be taking that high a medication. Of course, I had to explain to her, I did not pick that. Her father picked that. So she, yeah, changed her tune quickly after that. But yes. So we did a lot of changes over a period of months of decreasing my dosage of t four. And then at one point, we ended up even including some t three because I wasn't converting properly. So what was the dose of t four that you were initially on? I'm thinking it was, like, two fifty micrograms. Holy cow. Wow. Yeah. It was high. Do you know what your free t four was? Do you remember that just ballpark what that was? We could probably go take a look at that. I'm sure that's in here. But we can actually look at that. We can chart that if you wanna see it. Uh-huh. Interesting. So let's go to thyroid health. Okay. So which which one you wanna see first? Oh, wait. So, yeah, that's free T four. So, yeah, early on, I can see values high as two on the left. Oh, you're looking at T three, but on the left, free TFours on the on the on the on my left. Right? Free T three? Just one? No. Above that. I'm looking at free T four. Sorry. Alright. Let me just zoom in. So you had values higher than two. It's like I had one way up here at six. Well, it's crazy. That's crazy. That's that's, like, that's crazy that they they would do that. Yeah. Alright. And then still Yeah. Getting lower. I'm aiming now for values around point eight, even lower, maybe lower than the point seven five. Mhmm. It free t four increases That it thyroxine increases during aging. That's without a doubt. So lower is generally better, and all cause mortality risk lower is better. Alright. So free t three? Your average but this is with, obviously, this is with prescription. Correct. And you see them all over the place on that one. Yeah. So my data, actually, your lowest data, 2.5, I'm consistently, like, cc below the red line. You have, yeah, all of my data for, like, eight or nine tests in a row since I started, you know, digging deeper into this and not taking my endocrinologist for you know, just take t four. I I just assumed, oh, they know better. And then I was like, no. What I'm gonna look into it. All of my data has been 2.5, 2.3, and it that's too low. I mean, like, you have declines during aging and lower levels are associated with an increased all cause mortality risk. So you've had it very high too, though. I mean, my gosh. Yeah. So what's your current dose of what is it? Cytus, Cytomel? Or let me think about that. Think I'm on one thirty seven micrograms. Of side amount? So t three? I believe so. Man. Oh, no. No. I'm sorry. That's t four. Yeah. T three, I think I'm at twenty five micrograms. Oh, not bad. Interesting. How many tests did it take to to get you onto that? So you you basically cut t four in half. Yeah. It took, many, many months because she didn't want it's like I think there was a good six months between each test because she didn't wanna test any more frequent than that. Yeah. So I I know we changed a couple of times through there, but I clearly couldn't tell you what the increments were. Do you know what her rationale was for not testing every six months or more than six months? No. I don't think there actually was a rationale other than she didn't think the markers moved that quickly. That's ridiculous. I mean, t four, t three, when you take a pill of t three, it rises rapidly in blood. So there's another confounding variable with my data because there were times when that I would take my blood test before taking my morning medication. Other times that I took it after. Uh-huh. So that's gonna change some of these values. Right? So when you when you test now, it's totally fast. It's just water, nothing else? Yeah. That's what I've been trying to do. I've I've also, like, just I've been intentional about the last couple of tests. I think the last two tests, I took, I did, like well, maybe the last three tests. I tried two hours after taking the medication, then four hours, and now I'm going for six hours. So I wanna see what the what the difference is in that. Interesting. Why not just the test first thing in the morning and not do any meds before the test? I have done that, and everything shows really low, of course, because there is no, you know, there isn't any, endogenous stuff floating in my system at that point. But it's not I really know what the medication is doing when it's in. So, I mean, I know what things are gonna be like when I'm off the medication, but, you know, what is the medication? Am I on the proper dose of medication is what I'm trying to figure out. Yeah. Even if you took your medic so when you take your, t four and t three, do you take it in one dose, or you're taking it in split doses? No. Just one dose. Ah, so t three has a rep so t four has a relatively long half life. So once per day can work for that, but t three has a shorter half life. Short. Yeah. So I've been taking mine twice per day. I mean, my doctor said take it three times per day. I'm not taking it three times per day. I looked at I can send you I can send you the the, circadian rhythm for t three, the normal circadian rhythm for for t three, and it peaks, like, two to 4AM, and then it also peaks at nine in the morning. So I've been taking my t three with t four, some of it in the morning soon at, like, 9AM. And then before I go to bed, I'm taking, what is it, ten ten micrograms of cytomel so that I can get some of that peak in the middle of the night to try to you know, after a couple hours, it'll be absorbed so so that I should get that peak in the middle of the night, and then I'm taking it at nine in the morning, so I should get that peak. So my body looks like it's getting it should get on that normal circadian rhythm for, what a healthy thyroid looks like. And just to be clear, the cytomil is the t three? T three. Yeah. Three. Okay. Yeah. So I've got a two split two doses. We did discuss that last time with my new doctor, not my endocrinologist, my my current, you know, regular standard doctor. We may we may look into that for this next period. Yeah. So when when considering that, if you're taking it before you go to bed, you may not need to, you know, titrate the dose in the morning before a blood test. I mean, before bed, you should still have some amount that's still in the blood. Yeah. Then it would be valuable, I think, to take it completely fasted without my morning dose and then do the blood test to see. Yeah. F t three, free t three to free t four ratio, have you plotted that? Yes. Let me get this out of the way. That's over here. And what's crazy about that too is, like, you know, I'm sure for the longest time with your blood test, they just did a t s TSH and and, free t four and didn't even measure f t three. Oh, yeah. If I was relying strictly on my my doctor or endocrinologist test, yes. They were not measuring anything. It was just usually TSH is, like, all they look at. Yeah. So the only reason I have the these other data point is data points are because I did them myself. So how did you how did you look into the or you were just curious about how can I optimize thyroid function, and then you were like, oh, I should be measuring f t three? Wow. Yeah. Because I was working on everything else, and I had everything else, I thought, pretty well locked in, except my thyroid markers were way out of whack. Once I started working on the thyroid markers, it just everything else just went to crap. So then I had to start all over again with trying to dial down everything else. So when did you get your so alright. With so f t three, f t four. I was gonna say, when did you get that ratio, to relative where it is now, relatively high? And then it looks like it's more recently that you've gotten it, or it's this is a trend. The trend over time has been you've been moving it in the right direction. Yeah. The last couple of tests, I've still got some things that see, now, this is interesting. So my reference ranges here are lower than I have my optimal ranges. Oh, I mean, there may be some units. So you gotta, when when you have f t three, it depends that you gotta get the units because you usually, it's like point point three five, point three seven is useful. So there may be a unit difference because your the scale, you've got it in, like, you know, digits 3.7 and maybe a a unit being off where it should be, like, 0.367 And 0.267. But it's the same it it it should be the same idea nonetheless. But, but moving in the right direction, wait. So have you felt a difference in moving? No. No. Oh, just Not at all. Work out. Other fattening thing. I never knew I had a thyroid issue to begin with. Oh, man. I never I never felt anything. You're supposed to have, like, oh, gosh. You're you're supposed to be tired all the time. You're supposed to gain weight. You're supposed to have, you know, lack of interest in sex. No. I had none of that. The only symptoms I had were, like, my nose would occasionally be cold, maybe fingers, maybe toes. That's it. I just assumed everybody had that. And then after since your thyroid, the f t three, f t four has been increasing, cold nose, cold fingers, and toes less or same? Less. But, of course, you know, most of the time when I'm indoors in the summertime, people have the air condition cranked up so high. It's it's hard to tell. I mean, most people I know are wearing gloves anyway. So That's interesting that you don't feel a difference. I mean, so I I've that my battle for hypothyroidism is that whole thing. Like, get good sleep, still tired. You know, I could sleep I could always sleep. I you know, I'm you know, fingers and toes, always cold. Nose, always cold. So, I even did an experiment on myself a few years back. This maybe be, five or six years ago. I decided to just go cold turkey and just stop taking all my thyroid medication because I wanted to see what would happen. And again, I didn't feel anything. Mhmm. I didn't feel any difference. But after maybe it was a month, I started noticing, like, bags forming under my eyes, like, really bad bags. And I started noticing my hairline was thinning. And so it was the vanity aspect of it all that put me right back on it again. Wow. So I did that experiment too. I stopped all thyroid meds. TSH went way up, and I felt even more tired than
