So is very popular, and it's being offered to, many people and many celebrities are taking. The question is, does it work? And it's a complicated question. I want to make it very clear. Now only the IV does have clinical efficacy for neurological conditions and infectious disease for administer, you know, a number of, individuals. I'm not denying net clinical efficacy for certain indications. Now Now when it comes to longevity and awareness and, you know, energy, you really needed to get a interest in the NAD up. And this clinical trial that we did, and tried tried to answer another question. So you you have, before IV data in blue, after five sessions of IV data in orange, and I think we have 10 individuals here. You can see for these individuals, intracellular NAD levels did not change at all, after five sessions of NADIV. Each session, with, seven hundred fifty milligram of NAD plus. That's a pretty high, dosage by industry's standard. I don't have time to talk about why this is still we can discuss, if what people are interested in. And and then we put them on the all supplements, the vitality boost. You can see in most of these individuals, then the levels went higher than forty micromolar, and this one is, is increased but not optimized. And this one needs more than a thousand milligrams for the NMA that we we we did, and it's never went up. So oral supplements really work and can really efficiently increase, interest in that.
