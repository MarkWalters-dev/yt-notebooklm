Alright. So let's shift to to kidney function. So creatinine is also included in the pheno age, and then we can also drill down if you have cystatin c and blood urine nitrogen, uric acid. Yeah. I don't do cystat cyst if I can even say it, cystatin c that often, so I don't have very many data points for that, but the rest I do. So which one in particular did you wanna see? Did you wanna see Let's let's zoom in on creatinine. Okay. So we're right there. I don't know. If you wanna talk it through it, I should go through it. No. Go for it. You do it. You do it better than I do anyway. So So here. Yeah. I see your trend, 2017, relatively high, and then you've been reducing it over time, which is good news. So most people high points there too. Yeah. Oh, wow. Super high points. Yeah. And I know that's affected by my creatine consumption. Alright. So have you consumed less creatine over time? No. Not intentionally. No. I try to consume the the same amount, but, again, most of that is in with my my morning protein smoothie. And if I'm traveling, which I've been traveling a lot, then I'm haven't been getting my creatine. So that could be another reason why this has decreased. So more traveling over the past, well, eight years? More traveling, less shakes then? No. Like, since I retired. So it would just went in the past maybe three years. Yeah. But you can see the trend line goes all the way back. I mean, this is 2020. Yeah. Just starting from there. Yeah. Alright. But that could be a part of it. But, anyway, alright. So going in the right direction. So for more insight, blood urine nitrogen. So assuming your protein intake is constant, kidney function declines during aging. And one of the functions of the kidney is to basically remove substances from blood, urea being one of them, blood urea nitrogen being a marker of urea in blood. So if your protein protein intake is a constant, when considering kidney function declines during aging, if blood urine nitrogen has increased, then that would suggest, reduced kidney function. But, again, key point is if your protein intake has been a constant. Well, here's my my blood urea nitrogen, and it has been increasing. Yeah. But I I get you've increased protein intake over the past eight years? Yeah. I can't. I don't think that I have. I think I'm still saying staying pretty consistent with my protein intake. Yeah. So this is an interesting one because the creatinine decrease suggests better kidney function. But if that's just a measure of less creatine, we may be masking the real situation. And if your protein intake levels have been stable over time, this could be related to a decrease in kidney function, but we'd have to have more specificity in terms of, you know, how much protein were you consuming, how much is it now. Yeah. We can we can look at stuff like, you know, eGFR, which declines with age. So eGFR is derived from creatinine. So this is basically the same the same measure. Yeah. Like, the equation uses creatinine in in the in the measure. But uric acid, uric acid can give us more insight. So if uric acid is also increasing like blood urine nitrogen, that would suggest that we're on the wrong side of kidney function. So let's see. My uric acid oh, there's my cystatin. See? Two data point. Two only two data points. That's it. Yeah. Do do you have plans to measure that more often or not so much? I I do now. I before, I do didn't really realize it was a, a worthwhile variable to be looking at. So besides, it's it's as a marker, it it's less sensitive to changes in muscle mass, relative to creatinine as a marker of kidney function. But besides that, it, so, you know, GrimAge, the DNA methylation test GrimAge. Yeah. So GrimAge is the and this isn't hyperbole. You know? This is GrimAge is the best epigenetic clock for its association with all cause mortality risk. So I have a paper open in my tabs where it looked at all cause mortality risk, head to head matchup, pheno age, not the pheno age, you know, the blood base, the DNA methylation, estimation of pheno age, Horvath, Hannum, Dunedin Pace, and the clock that had the largest, association with all cause mortality was by far was GRIMH. So then it raises the question, what is GRIMH trained on? And one of the proteins that, you know so you've got so it's seven proteins, and it's smoking, smoking pack years, and I think chronological age. And it's right? So they they took actual levels of those nine variables. If I'm leaving one out, you know, whoever's watching that's gonna grill me on that, forgive me, but seven proteins. Right? So they took those actual measures and then did the epigenetic prediction and then used that epigenetic prediction for all cause mortality risk. So of those seven proteins, cystatincy is on the list. But then note that just like PhenoAge where RDW was the strongest predictor, or strongest contributor to the PhenoAge number, all seven proteins didn't contribute to the grim age, in value. Right? So some are more stronger contributors than others. For example, leptin is on that list, and leptin was basically weak, you know, but still significant in the GrimAge prediction. Cystatin c's correlation with the overall GrimAge score was very high. It was, like, point nine. So I've included that on every test now going forward. You know, for me, I'd rather have the actual biomarkers rather than the prediction GRIMH. Yeah. Yeah. So which ones do you do every time now? Cystatin c and leptin? Both? Not leptin. So actually leptin because it was so weak. And leptin's proportional to fat mass. So, you know, we're already lean. I can't imagine it's gonna be high. Now granted, if I started to increase body fat, I'd I'd see higher leptin. But so leptin is a low value one for me. Beta two microglobulin is also on that list. That's, and that I I'm including that for the first time next week. I'm gonna do that for every test. That's possible. One test for each of those. That's why they didn't show up in the graphs. Nice. So I need at least two data points for those to show. Gotcha. But those are the two big ones that I'm gonna measure. The other ones like GDF 15, not commercially available, but very strong predictor of grim age. And there are a couple other ones, like temp one some or temp something. Never heard of it before. Very strong predictor. And then PAI one, but it's it's, core that's commercially available, but its correlation was weaker. Yeah. So cystatin c is not in one of my my normal panels, so I would just have to add do that as an add on from here on out. Yeah. I think it's important. I'm gonna keep including it, trying to get it as low as possible. So my uric acid, you mentioned that. That should show up here somewhere else, but, it's not showing up as a kidney health marker. Mhmm. Maybe it's maybe it's listed as a liver health marker. I don't know. Yeah. Uric acid. Very good. Alright. So let's let's zoom in on that one. That one at least looks like it's going in the right direction. Yeah. Definitely. So so this is this is good news. That so the way I interpret this is, you know, the decreased creatine, less creatinine. So we can't say anything about your kidney function yet, because it may be influenced by creatine. Your bun is probably impacted by protein intake, and the reason I say that is because your uric acid is decreasing. If kidney function was declining, I'd expect to see an age related increase for uric acid, not a decrease, with lower moving towards lower all cause mortality risk. So this is this is good news. Then the next question is when considering your bun is increasing, so, urea and blood is formed, from nitrogen. So your body will remove nitrogen, say, from proteins and then form urea. So urea has two nitrogen groups. So then it raises the question, is your protein intake a bit too high? And, because urea isn't just the metabolite in blood. So urea in very high levels can circulate to the intestine where it can degrade the tight junctions, allowing for more stuff to leak into the blood. Now is that at your, current level? I don't remember. I think it was, like, eighteen or nineteen milligrams per deciliter. Is that high enough to do that? I don't know. Don't know. But that be that could be something to experiment with as suggestion, you know, maybe cutting protein intake 10 or twenty grams and seeing if that reduces blood urine nitrogen, but then also maybe you get a boost in other biomarkers too. Because if it's too high for blood urine nitrogen and that is allowing for stuff to leak into the blood, you may may see changes whether it's HSCRP or alkaline phosphatase. We can look at those too. So here's the the total protein that you were interested in. So total protein is more a marker of albumin plus globulins, so not necessarily a marker of protein intake. And so, you know, it in very old people, usually, albumin is thought of as a marker of malnutrition, but, anecdotally, I don't know. In my data, protein intake doesn't correlate with albumin, globulins, or total protein. It's more tightly regulated than that.
