For blood test number three in 2025, when using doctor Morgan Levine's biological age calculator PhenoAge, we saw that my biological age was 34.8 years which is seventeen years younger than the chronological. Now, if you missed that video, I'll link to it in the right corner. Now, anybody can enter data into a spreadsheet as I have here. So in today's video, we'll take a deep dive into the full lab test report and analysis. And that's what we'll see here starting with page one of four of the blood test report. And note that I don't go to my doctor to get these tests done. I go to altalabtest.com, where I order exactly the test that I want, and then I bring the lab form to Quest Diagnostics. And then I got the majority of these or I got all of these results within three days as we'll see here. So I tested on April 22 around eight in the morning, and I had all these results, four pages of data, three days later. And the majority of these results were ready within twenty four hours. So if you're into blood testing like I am and you'd like to help support the channel, you can do that by using the affiliate link in the video's description. Now, although I'm focused on pheno age or biological age as a part of the overall approach, note that I'm not solely focused on those biomarkers as that clock and many other biological age clocks have weak spots. So I'm trying to cover as many organ systems that biomarkers of as many organ systems as possible to leave no stone unturned. Now, in terms of weak spots, that's where we'll start. And one of my most major weak spots is Candida IGG. So you can see that it's 1.1 and it's high, and this is higher than the labs reference range. So what that indicates is that at some point in the past, they had an infection, a Candida infection, and this isn't a recent infection. As you can see, IGM is not elevated. So so that suggests this is a past infection not a recent one. Nonetheless, that IGG for Candida is above the reference range. It suggests that my immune system has to work harder than it should to help keep systemic Candida in check. And note that these aren't just numbers on a page. I have unfortunately, two of my toes that look like fungally infected. Now, whether that's local to my toes and it's not grossly systemic at other places, I don't know. But I prefer to help my immune system by reducing systemic levels of candida IGG. With that in mind, I've tried, following the correlations with olives. For whatever reason, olives through 10 tests are significantly correlated with lower IGG in my data. So I bumped up olive intake by a lot. Now, whether that'll make a dent, we'll find out on the next test for a May 27 test. But if it doesn't, I met with my dermatologist who prescribed fluconazole, which has been shown to reduce systemic Candida levels. So if olives don't do the trick for whatever reason, if Candida levels stay higher than the reference range for now 10 tests in a row, as you can see as I've illustrated here, I'll go to fluconazole which is hard to say for me. After the May 27 test, I'll take that for two weeks and then do a mid June test only testing Candida IGG to see if I can finally bring it lower to the reference range. And this story may go back as far as 2017 as I have a singular test in that year for Candida IGG and there too, it was higher than the reference range. Now, another potential weak spot, semi weak spot though is DHEA sulfate, which is an androgen that declines during aging. Now, youthful levels of DHEA sulfate are 300 micrograms per deciliter. And about twenty years ago, I had two tests with values in that range. But I don't know if those are my youthful values, or I was supplementing with DHEA at that time, which would explain relatively high DHEA sulfate. So I can't say which it was because I wasn't taking careful notes, unfortunately, twenty years ago. The good news though, on the other hand, is that my DHEA sulfate levels have been stable over more than 20 tests for the past three years. Somewhere around a 125 micrograms per deciliter. So there's good news in that I've resisted a further age related change, but the plan is to improve it and and get it back to 300 if I can without exogenously applied prescriptions at least for now. On the other hand, the RDW which is one of the major predictors or the major predictor of doctor Morgan Levine's pheno age is good news at 12 o. Now, in terms of what's optimal for RDW, it's 11.4 to 12.6. And that's based on a study of three point four million people for all cause mortality risk. The other side of that is that RDW increases during aging. So this isn't just keep it at 12.5. It's avoiding one's age avoiding an age related increase within one's own data. For example, it could be 11.5, 11.7, 11.9, twelve one, twelve three. Still within range but increasing over time. So the goal for RDW is to resist its age related increase and to keep it within this optimal range. And if you're wondering where I'm getting those data from, and you'd like to see that data, I have a new Patreon tier dedicated specifically to what's optimal for biomarkers. This tier currently involves more than two hours of video content, and I'm planning on expanding it over time, for all of 29 biomarkers shown here including RDW. And as I mentioned coming soon, so I'm gonna add to this tier or what's optimal not just based on heart disease mortality risk, but also all cause mortality risk for APO B, APO A one and their ratio. Now, also on the list are lymphocytes. So in terms of how I'm doing there, for those who are familiar with the channel, you know that for the past year or so, around 10 tests, lymphocytes had been moving away from what's optimal around 2,000. As values around 2,000 are more likely to be found in 20 year olds, and values around 2,000 are associated with lowest all cause mortality risk. As lymphocytes decline both during aging and in association with all cause mortality risk, there's an increase in all cause mortality risk. So, my data has been moving in the wrong direction for the past 10 tests or so. Now, this test is slightly better than the last as last test was twelve sixty seven, this one is thirteen forty three. So it moved in the right direction. I was expecting a bigger bump though. So stay tuned for my, plans to further improve lymphocytes. And I've made a few changes for the next test. Some of that I'll cover in the next video in the series in terms of, dietary changes and supplements. So stay tuned for that. Now, a new addition to the testing protocol is beta two microglobulin or b two m. Now, this may seem like an obscure biomarker. Probably, many have not heard of this biomarker. But to illustrate its imp illustrate its importance, b two m is one of the strongest predictors of DNA of the DNA methylation crop clock. Sorry. GrimAge two. Now, if you missed that video on GrimAge, GrimAge is the best or close to the best epigenetic clock when comparing other epigenetic clocks for their association with all cause mortality risk. And just like RDW is a major predictor of pheno age, b two m is one of the major predictors for the overall grim age score. Now, rather than having the epigenetic prediction of all cause mortality risk, I'd rather have the actual biomarkers that went into that prediction. And b two m is one of those biomarkers. So the plan, my plan is to include b two m for every test going forward. And in terms of what's optimal, lower is better. And I I'll have a video on that coming soon whether that that'll be on YouTube or Patreon yet. I haven't decided. But, keeping it relatively low is the plan as it's higher levels would be associated with an older grim age, which is bad news. In my case, 1.53 is good news. How low though that I can go, we'll find out as this is a new addition to the testing protocol. Alright. So on to page two of the report, and another grim age predictor or that was used for the overall grim age algorithm is Cystatin C. So for those who are into blood testing like me, Cystatin C may seem familiar as a kidney function biomarker which it is. But it's again, also an important predictor of grim age. So, with those two things in mind, I'm gonna continue to measure cystatin c for every test going forward. Not just for kidney function but also for its, grim age because it's included in grim age. In terms of my data for this test, point eight three milligrams per liter may not seem high based on the reference range but this is my worst data over the past four tests. Or actually, I only have four four data points but I'm gonna keep measuring it over time. In terms of what's optimal, based on all cause mortality risk and what's found in youth as opposed to how it changes during aging, less than zero point seven milligrams per liter. And and again, those data, those images and the references are on the core on the, what's optimal tier on Patreon. So when considering less than point seven is optimal, point eight three is moving away from that. And in terms of my own data, I've had Cystatin C values of point seven two. It's just a matter of discovering the recipe, diet and supplements, mostly diet though, that can help keep it closer to point seven or lower. And because I only have four data points, there's a lot of noise in the data. So it's very hard to say what may help keep it relatively low. But stay tuned for that story as I'm planning on testing for every test going forward to to discover that recipe. Alright. So then more Some good news is, our levels of three t four and three t three. These are thyroid hormone biomarkers. And the reason the, these these are good news is because f t four went down, and f t three went up. And that's important because their ratio So the conversion of the inactive thyroid hormone, f t four into the active thyroid hormone, f t three declines during aging. So that ratio, f t three divided by f t four declines during aging. So with that in mind, my ratio has been around point two for every test since last year. But for this test, it was my highest to date at point three three. Now, I wish I could say I got there by following correlations with diet and supplements etcetera which I do for all biomarkers or all of the major ones. But, when considering that I'm hypothyroid, I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my twenties, thyroid gland atrophy based on ultrasound. So I've been taking thyroid meds since then. Almost exclusively Levothyroxine. Fortunately, I was able to find a doctor in Boston. My endocrinologist canceled my appointment appointment when they found out I was gonna try to switch to some, t three and less t four. But my doctor was willing to work with me on this as I showed him all of the published data, and we reduced my t four dose and increased or added t three. Now, that was the first step. I've since added a bit more t three and I'm going to reduce t four by a little bit more to further increase that ratio in terms of what's optimal, just without going to the what's optimal tier on Patreon, but that data is there. Those images are there. Those references are there. Less than point eight for f t four is the goal and greater than 3.2 for f t three. So I'm almost there but I've got to make another dose titration to get there. Alright. Then, good news. And on to some liver function biomarkers including albumin. Albumin at five point o is good news as it declines during aging, so I wanna keep it relatively high and around five is good news. It's all almost all of my data is around five. Alkaline phosphatase at 45 is also good news. Less than 48 is associated with lowest all cause mortality risk and that's in a meta analysis of about nine million people. And again, these data are on the what's optimal tier on Patreon. But then adding some, more context to the liver function and health story is that AST and ALT increased. And they moved away from the what's optimal high teens, low twenties to values that are moving in the wrong direction. Now, in terms of biomarkers of liver health and function, while they are generally good ones in term in terms of liver disease mortality, GGT may be a better biomarker at least in a head to head matchup, where GGT was compared against AST and ALT. So with that in mind, my GGT at 11 is good news as values less than 12 are associated with lowest all cause mortality risk. And then as GGT increases, that's associated with increased all cause mortality risk. So the overall liver function, liver health and function story, is good news, but I do have room for improvement with AST and ALT. And then for another biomarker that may seem obscure is immunoglobulin g. Now, the importance of IgG, this is the total IgG. So candida IgG is a sub fraction of the overall, IgG that circulates in blood. So the importance of this is that reducing IGG extends lifespan at least in mice. And if you missed that video, I'll link to it in the right corner. Additionally, interventions that reduce IGG in animal models including calorie restriction, parabiosis and exercise training also reduce IGG, which suggests it has an important role during, aging and potentially in longevity. So with that in mind, I'm gonna include it for every test going forward. Now in terms of what's optimal, that's a bit tricky because it may be an inverse u shape. There aren't very many large epidemiological studies in terms of hundreds of thousands of people. Very small studies in terms of, you know, hundreds to, you know, a few thousand people where IGG increases during aging. But this is up to around eighty years. After eight years, there's no I haven't come across any data on how IGG changes during aging. And if anyone's come across those data, please post it in the comments. I'd be happy to give you a shout out in a future video. So with that in mind, and there are as far as I know, there is no all cause mortality data, large epidemiological studies for IGG. So that makes discerning what's optimal a bit tricky. And when I say what's optimal, I mean within the reference range. So clearly, I don't want to be higher than the reference range because having IGG too high, at least based on the animal studies, may be bad for longevity. But on the other hand, is our values close to 800 optimal, 1,100? I don't yet know. And one way I plan to address that is by testing IGG for every blood test, so at least eight times per year. And then doing a biomarker versus biomarker analysis, IGG versus around 25 to 30 other standard biomarkers to see how it looks in comparison. Whether, you know, relatively lower would be better or higher would be better, you know, around a thousand in terms of how other biomarkers look within that context. So I'm about a year away from having that data, so stay tuned for that video coming sometime next year. Now, to add a bit more context to the IgG story and its overall importance, IgG or immunoglobulin is a globulin. And you can see that globulins are one of the most abundant proteins found in blood. Actually, they're one of the most abundant abundant substances found in blood. Albumin is the highest concentration of any substance in blood at least based on proteins and metabolites as it's found at five grams or five thousand milligrams per deciliter. For context, glucose at 80 milligrams per deciliter in total cholesterol at 200 versus albumin at 5,000. So similarly, globulins, total globulins are would be 2.2 grams per deciliter or 2,200 milligrams per deciliter. So at least 10 x higher than a total cholesterol of, 200 milligrams per deciliter. Now, that doesn't mean it's more important. It just indicates that it's one of the largest trees circulating in the blood forest. And with that in mind, I find the it it the most instructive to not only look at small trees that may be important, as we'll see like Cystatin C which is at a far lower dose relatively to albumin and globulins. But also by studying and optimizing the biggest trees including albumin and globulins and as a subdivision of globulins, immunoglobulin. Which as you look, immunoglobulin is one one thousand sixty three in this case, milligrams per deciliter or around 1.1 grams per deciliter. So total globulins are 2.2 grams per deciliter. So that means that IGG is about half of total globulins. So globulins are a big tree in the blood ecosystem and within that, subdividing that IGG is one of the biggest trees within the overall globulin context. Now, to add a third layer of why IGG is important, when comparing comparing it against Cystatin C, which again, I'm not trying to say Cystatin C is not important. It is. It's important biomarker of kidney function and predictor of grim age. But in terms of concentration, it's a relatively small tree in the overall blood ecosystem. When comparing its concentration against I G G, I G G is 13,000 times more concentrated in blood than Cystatin C. Now, that doesn't mean that IGG is thirteen thirteen thousand times more important. It just illustrates that IGG is a big tree and I find that it's informative to measure not just the smallest trees but the biggest trees in the ecosystem that is the blood in terms of biomarkers. Alright. So moving on through the blood test report, where I agree with the reference range is that my white blood cells at 3.4 is indeed low. If we're gonna discern what's optimal for total white blood cells, somewhere around 44 or 4.4 may be optimal Based on around 2,000 for neutrophils, 2,000 for lymphocytes, and around 400 for monocytes. And then you can scatter in the basophils and eosinophils which are very low. So somewhere in around 4,400 may be optimal or 4.4. So with that in mind, I I agree with the with the lab report that 3.4 is indeed low. Now, lymphocytes are a major factor driving that story. So stay tuned for that again as I plan on optimizing them over the upcoming tests. Another potential weak spot or brewing weak spot spot which I'm trying to get on top of sooner rather than later is hemoglobin, which may not seem like a problem at 14.6. But it's on going in the wrong direction when considering my 56 test average since 2015 is 15 grams per deciliter. So 14.6 is moving in the wrong direction. But that's just one test in 2025. My three test average in 2025 is 14.8 grams per deciliter, which may not seem like a big deal, but my eight test average in 2024 was also 14.8. Now, this may seem like nitpicky. Right? 15 verse 14.8. So what? Big deal. Right? But if we play this out 50 for fifty years, and I've got a point two gram per deciliter decline every year, eventually, hemoglobin levels are gonna be aged. And I'm trying to avoid that at all costs. So the plan is to maintain, to optimize biomarkers that need to be optimized and to maintain biomarkers at youthful levels based on my own youthful levels in the published literature. So with that in mind, the plan is to keep hemoglobin at 15 and not 14.6, 14.8, etcetera. Now, also going beyond just hemoglobin is glycated hemoglobin or HbA one c. An important measure of metabolic health. So although 5.4 isn't terrible based on how HbA one c changes during aging, It increases during aging or all cause mortality risk values within the five to 5.7 range may be optimal with lower being better. But note that this is my worst value, 5.4 over eight tests. And unfortunately, I only have eight tests going back to 2015. So with that in mind, I'm gonna test H b a one c for every test going forward. So we're gonna have it at least eight tests per year. And for those who sometimes ask, what would you change? You know, what could you tell your younger self? I wish I was testing H b a one c for every test in my youth, So I'd have the recipe worked out sooner rather than later. Now, I've got to go back and try to discover the H b a one c optimization recipe. Alright. So on to page three. And a part of that recipe for optimizing H b a one c is fasting glucose, which may not seem like too high for based on ninety four milligrams per deciliter as it's within the optimal range 80 to 94, which is based on all cause mortality risk. But it's higher than my 60 test average since 2015, around 90 milligrams per deciliter. But if we're gonna play devil's advocate, it's better than expected based on chronological age for how glucose changes during aging, which expected value based on my current chronological age would be a 100 milligrams per deciliter on average. So regardless of what the chronological age expected data is, at worst, I wanna be no worse than my own average 90 milligrams or 89.7 milligrams per deciliter and a bit lower if I can. Alright. So moving on to lipoproteins or ApoB starting there. 66 is less than the reference range. But note that those data for the reference range and I cover this a bit in my last video, blood test number two in twenty twenty five series. These data for the reference range in the lab report may be a bit outdated. So when we look at the most recent data in the largest studies that exist, and I've cited one of them here, lowest heart disease mortality risk for APOB is associated associated with values that are less than 76, not 90 milligrams per deciliter. And this isn't starting in the general population. This isn't people with pre existing CVD. For sure, if you have pre existing CVD, lower is better and lower than 70 as low as possible may be better. But in terms of studies that don't look at or or in studies of the general population for people who don't have pre existing CVD, which is a study that I'm citing, less than 76 may be optimal at least based on heart disease mortality risk. So using that as the benchmark, 66 for this test, good news. One thirty five for April a one based on the reference range also is good news. But using that same study, and again, these data are on, will be on Patreon in a full video. But if you missed it, it's in the blood test number. Some of it is in the in the last video which I'll link to it in the in the right corner. In terms of lowest heart disease mortality risk, that's APO a one levels that are greater than a hundred and fifty milligrams per deciliter. Now, I have had values for APO a one that are that high. I've been playing with trying to reduce my HDL by a bit, which is gonna bring down Apo a one because in my data, there's an inverse correlation between higher HDL and lower lymphocytes. Now, I may be disconnecting that at some point where I try to keep HDL relatively high while trying also to keep my lymphocytes high and assume that that those two biomarkers are not connected as they are at least based on correlations in my data. So that's a story for another day. Nonetheless, I'm planning on bringing my APO a one back to higher than one fifty to be at lowest heart disease mortality risk. Now, a third variable in the APO b and APO a one story is their ratio. And before going there, I should mention that in terms of the reference range again, note that the study that I'm referencing is from the same first author, Waldius, and the same study, the Amoris study as shown in the references highlighted with the black arrow. So the data that I'm referencing is the most recent data for the same study published seventeen years later. Alright. So in terms of what's optimal for the ratio, APO B divided by APO A one. I'm using less than 76 for APO B and and greater than one fifty for APO A one. What's optimal may not be point seven seven, but instead far lower at less than point five. 76 divided by one fifty is about point five. So with that in mind, with that restrictive ratio, still good news though at point four nine. Alright. But this is only part of the story. Heart disease, although it's a top cause of death, the top five cause of death, it's only part of the story. I don't want to optimize against heart disease mortality risk, and then miss other parts of the story, you know, death from cancer or respiratory disease or other causes of death. So how are apo b and, you know, apo a one and and their ratio, how are they associated with all cause mortality risk? So that video, is coming soon. And again, it'll I'll add it specifically to Patreon. So if you're interested in that, I would subscribe to the what's optimal for biomarkers tier, and see you'll see that story relatively soon. Alright. On to the last page of the blood test report and staying with the theme of lipoproteins and triglycerides which are found in the LDL. So my triglycerides at 60 may not seem super high, but less than 45 is associated with lowest heart disease mortality risk. So that's the benchmark that I'm trying to work towards and to get it there consistently. Consistently lower than 45 for every test, not one test but as many tests as I can infinitely for every blood test going forward. We can also see that HDL close to optimal 50 to 60 in men at 61 milligrams per deciliter. And that's important because many people struggle, with increasing or keeping HDL relatively high, and I was one of them. I've had HDL levels as low as 28 since 2015 over the past ten years. But over the past 17 tests, 17 tests in a row, average HDL is 57 milligrams per deciliter right within its optimal range. So for those who struggle with HDL and trying to keep it in that 50 to 60 at least for men, the the range is a bit wider for women. It's about 50 to 75. For those who may struggle with increasing HDL, it is possible, non pharma ways. It's just a matter in my case of discovering the recipe within my own diet that can help remove what I whatever inhibition I had from allowing HDL to be relatively high relative to the 28 value. Alright. Next up, HSCRP, which is less than the detection limit at point two milligrams per liter. And that's important because this is now the twenty fourth test in a row where HSCRP is lower than the labs detection limit, which was less than point three milligrams per liter for the first 17 tests. And since then, for whatever reason, Quest has gotten I guess a bit better at their detection limit. Where now, it's seven tests in a row less than point two milligrams per liter. And then, last but not least for the biomarkers is homocysteine, which is has moved in the right direction but I'd like to bring it even lower, to value somewhere around five which is based, on all cause mortality and dementia risk. Now, I don't have the MTHFR polymorphism which can lead to higher homocysteine levels than than should be. I've had values around five in the past about twenty years ago, and I'm not sure if that was just my useful data or I was supplementing. I I'm not sure because I wasn't taking detailed records at that time. So this isn't a gene polymorphism story because if it was, I'd expect high levels of homocysteine way back when and no age related increase which or I should say it may not be age related increase. It may be some aspect of diet where there are aspects of my diet. And I won't go into that story yet, but we'll see how the test goes for the, May 27 homocysteine test as I remove some stuff in my diet that may impact homocysteine. So stay tuned for that story in an upcoming video. In terms of what may have helped move homocysteine from 11 to nine, I started supplementing again with the only thing that's, consistently worked in my case, which is a combination of a thousand micrograms of methyl b twelve, four hundred micrograms of Methylfolate, and very low dose vitamin b six, one point five milligrams. And I started that on March 27, so there was about three weeks before testing where I was taking that every day. Alright. So what I haven't yet gone through in this story is what diet and or supplements underlies all of these biomarker data. And in the interest of time, I'll cover that in the next video.
