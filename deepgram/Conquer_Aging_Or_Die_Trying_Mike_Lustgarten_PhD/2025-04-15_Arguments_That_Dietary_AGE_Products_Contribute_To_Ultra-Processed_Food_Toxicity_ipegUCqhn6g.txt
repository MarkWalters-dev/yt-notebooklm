Arguments to justify why I believe that dietary AGs are major contributor. I'm not saying that they are the only. I mean, foods are very complicated matrices, and that that will be ridiculous to say, but are a very important one. AGs and other major reaction products are questionable generating food during the thermal processing. AGs generated in food are structurally and physiologically indistinguishable from their endogenous counterpart. AGs such as CML have been documented, again, to produce tissue injuries in almost all cell system and tissues prone. And, again, if they are not different from the endogenous, how is the body know if it came from outside or if it came from inside? Oral administration of labeled Hg loads in human that we have done have been shown to be absorbed into circulation and mostly eliminated in the urine, as I said before, but some remaining in circulation and tissues. Diodes loaded with Hg in different mouse models lead to development of I I mean, insulin resistant prevented by diet loss and AGEs. I show you that. Healthy human subject exposed to an AGE rich diet show increasing market of inflammation and insulin resistant. I did not show you that. Patient with insulin resistant or type two diabetes exposed to a low energy diet show reversal of marker of inflammation and insulin resistant. I did show you that. So these are a lot of, argument.
