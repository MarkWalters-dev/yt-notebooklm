So there's an HSCRP, which is nice and low. Wait. Can we go to the That's one point. Besides the year to year change, can we go to the trend line? Oh, sorry. Yeah. Can we there we go. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Alright. So now yeah. Can you scroll up just a little bit? Sure. There we go. Yeah. So yeah. So I got this one point right here. I don't know what that was all about. But My gosh. I mean, people very old people have levels can have levels that high. Right? So, that's the trick. That was still in the reference range too because I you don't see the top of that reference range red line. So but scary. Yeah. Alright. So good news is you've, you know, been reducing it over time, whereas the most recent test look like they're right outside of is that point two or point three is the upper limit? That's a great question. I mean, I can go right to the data and take a look. HSCRP. Again, I need to have this alphabetized better. This is like an eye chart for for me, so I can imagine what it looks like for you. Oh, here we go. Okay. So, 0.33. Oh, no. That's 2021 data. Let me scroll over. Oh, wow. Silly me. My latest was, like, right here in front of my face. So point 36 was my latest, like, point 2, point 24. Fantastic. That's great. That's really great. Yeah. TNF alpha looks like it's gone up a bit. Wait. Wait. Wait. Dave, that's a big one to measure. So Okay. I measured it from my last test. And so, you know, so cancer incidence increases during aging. Right? It isn't just avoid cardiovascular disease, cancer number two. Well, in most cases and most studies for, you know, how we're gonna die or most most likely to die. So tumors secrete, pro inflammatory cytokines, including t and f alpha, IL six, h s c r p. So even if h s c r p is low, t and f alpha, IL six, and others could be higher. And if that trend over time so your HSCRP is good. It's going in the right direction. But TNF alpha, if that's increasing, granted it's only two data points, IL six And this last one was in 2022, so this is quite old. So Yeah. I definitely need to do a retest. So So what I'm doing is if it's below the limit of detection, I'm not measuring it for every test eight times a year. But if it's above that, I I would I'd I'd start tracking it to keep an eye on it, try to keep it as low as possible. Yeah. What is the optimal range for this? Because I don't have it's not graphing on this because my numbers are so small, I think. Yeah. As low as possible. I think the reference range is point four picograms per mil, below the limit of detection. That that would be the optimal. Okay. So then I'm higher than I wanna be for that. Based on these but it's it's just two tests. We don't know if that's representative of all data and, you know, exercise standardization. That could probably increase TNF alpha.
