The foundation foundation roots of aging to actually study and optimize. Yeah. For sure. But there is another central premise of my channel besides track and optimize, and it's basically self empowerment. Like, we don't have to wait for RCTs and other people. We don't have to wait for animal studies that may or may not translate into human longevity. We can test ourselves and often, you know, I think most take most people take that for granted. Like so many people are taking supplements and they never actually see, like, is this a net benefit neutral or detrimental to my actual health? So that that's probably, you know, the third rung of the, premise, essential premise, like track, test and track. You know? Yeah. Don't take something based on hope. What is the date what does your own data say? So Exactly. And and I I talk about that day in and day out. I feel like now there was a keyword there that I really liked you said, which was you kinda corrected yourself. You said track your data track your own data. Right? Yeah. And I think that's really important, and we'll get into exactly what you've been doing, which is is great and amazing proof of concept. But even with the epigenetic DNA methylation testing, a lot of people see, oh, well, there's this clinical trial, and there's still very few clinical trials as we know. Right? It's it's very new technology. And they'll go to something based on that clinical trial, and I'll say, well, wait a second. Sure. You can use that as a guide, but we still don't even know if that works for you.
