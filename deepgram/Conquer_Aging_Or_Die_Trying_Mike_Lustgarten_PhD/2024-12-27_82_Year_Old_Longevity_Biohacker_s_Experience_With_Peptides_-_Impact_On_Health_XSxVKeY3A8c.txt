I think probably most people know or have heard of amino acids and know that they're important to the body. And if you string amino acids together, in chains or whatever, you get if there aren't too many of them, say, less than 50 amino acids, we usually call that a peptide. And if you get into larger numbers, then we typically call that a protein. So for example well, I'll come to that later. But, anyway, Cabinson was a research scientist in the the head of the Institute of Bioregulation and Gerontology in, Saint Petersburg, Russia. And he developed a suite of peptides that are only two or three or four amino acids long. And these are available let me just reach over here. They come in little packages like this. This one is bisolutin, and bisolutin is to treat the eyes. This will be a peptide of about two or three amino acids. And Kenneth, is that taken orally or that's like a drop that you put directly on the eyes? Well, this particular version is a capsule. And so I take typically, in a given month, I take about, five to seven different peptides from the Cabinson suite. I'm part of the ongoing trial to replicate results that occurred being done in Russia. And so this particular package costs about $45. It has 20, capsules in it. You take two capsules a day for ten days, and then that's it. Every month, I take a different mix of about five different, five to seven different, peptides of the Cabinson suite. We've been doing that for about four years now, I think, three and a half years. And, it's difficult to say exactly what the impact is, except that occasionally, we see very specific improvements. So for example, I know that the bisolutin, when I take it, helps my vision a bit. Okay? I can read the newspaper, struggling a little bit maybe, without my readers. Okay? There's a version of bisolutin which you can take sublingually to squirt it under your tongue, and sometimes I use that instead of the capsules. One of the, peptides is called sirlutin, which is targeted at the brain. And the first time my wife took sirlolutin, we saw a profound impact within a day or two. So we can sometimes see that impact. Sometimes it's more, evenly dispersed in terms of its impact. But taking this for, you know, three or four years, I I have to believe that it has helped me in terms of my general physiology. If I can't measure anything specifically, you know, try and keep up with me on the dance floor. Okay? Yep. So so peptide, and then you've, also done, I think, follistatin gene therapy? Yes. Let me just say one more thing about the peptides. One of the things that they determined in the studies in Russia was that if you took this program for about three to five years, your, survival rate was double or triple your others in your peer group. So if you're trying to stay alive, which hopefully everybody is, this would be a good thing to get into. You take it for three to five years. As I say, I'm taking, five to seven of these at so it's costing me $350 a month. K. Keeps me alive. It's the bargain.
