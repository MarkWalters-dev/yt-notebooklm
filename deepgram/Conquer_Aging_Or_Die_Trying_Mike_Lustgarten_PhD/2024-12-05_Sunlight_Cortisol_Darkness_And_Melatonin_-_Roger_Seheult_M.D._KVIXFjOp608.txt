So cortisol is the hormone of the day, at the beginning of the day, and melatonin is the hormone of the beginning of the night. And the way the way you really want those are impulses. So if you don't get morning sunlight, that pulse of cortisol that you should be getting to get the body ready to go and tune is gonna be more delayed, and you're not gonna get the effects of that cortisol as much as if you got morning light and that peak of cortisol to start your day off in the morning. It's like a cup of coffee. Literally, I mean, I've heard people talk about how they how it feels to them. Morning sunlight is as it gives them the energy of a cup of coffee, of course, without the coffee. The same thing happens in the evening time, except that it's the lack of sunlight that does it. It's the lack of artificial light that does this. So not having light around 09:00, 10:00, 11:00 allows this peak of melatonin to be able to occur from the pineal gland because it's not being shut down by the, the light being shone into your eyes, this also happens. And so you really need both of these things to be to be able to occur. Lack of light after 09:00 and bright shining light at 09:00 in the morning to allow that cortisol level for the day.
