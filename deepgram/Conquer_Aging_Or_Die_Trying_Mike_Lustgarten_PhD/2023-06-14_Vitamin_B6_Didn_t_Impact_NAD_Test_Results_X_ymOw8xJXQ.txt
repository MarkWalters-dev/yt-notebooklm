Tryptophan is converted into NAD by the de novo NAD synthesis pathway. But as we saw in an earlier video, there's an age related decline for vitamin b six or more specifically, pyridoxal five phosphate p five p that may limit the conversion of tryptophan into NAD. And it's in support of that, we saw in that video that kynurenine levels increase during aging in conjunction with the age related decline for NAD. So that raises the hypothesis. If I increase vitamin b six intake, can I increase NAD? So for NAD test number four, I sent blood to Ginfinity. And for those who are interested in doing the same, there'll be a discount link in the video description. On that test, we saw that my NAD levels were 30.1 micromolar which was going in the right direction when compared with test number one, twenty five point six micromolar and test number two, twenty five point three micromolar. Now, note that for test number four, my average b six intake was eleven point three milligrams per day and note that I track my diet every day. That's how I know the amount of b six in my diet. So that eleven point three milligrams per day was significantly higher than test than for test number one and two. Three point two milligrams per day. So about a 3.5 fold increase in my average b six intake. So with that in mind, for test number five, I then raised my average b six intake, average daily b six intake about three x higher to thirty seven point two milligrams per day. And that averages for the thirty two day period in between test number four to the day, before test number five. So did a further three fold increase for vitamin b six increase NAD. And actually, it did not. So my data went from 30.1 micromolar down to 22.3 micromolar and in fact, this is the lowest NAD level that I've had thus far over five tests. So to answer the question, did a further threefold increase for vitamin b six increase NAD? It did not. And in my case, vitamin b six, I think it's fair to conclude that vitamin b six even over these past two tests, not just this most recent test, did not increase NAD. Now, all hope is not lost as we saw in the last video. Quinolinic acid levels increase during aging which which suggests that the block, the age related block in this pathway may actually be with Quinolinic acid. So with that in mind, in that video, I focused on the conversion of Quinolinic acid to NAD and how we may potentially impact that which involves grape seeds or grape seed proanthocyanidin extract. Alright. That's all for now. If you're interested in more of my attempts to biohack aging, check us out on Patreon. And before you go, we've got a whole bunch of discount links and merch that you may be interested in including discount links for at home metabolomics, NAD quantification with GINFINITY as I just mentioned, green tea, epigenetic testing, oral microbiome composition, at home blood testing with SYFOX which has a different panel than the at home metabolomics, dye tracking, or if you'd like to support the channel, you can do that with the website, buy me a coffee. We've also got merch. So if you're interested in wearing the Conqueror Aging or DIY Tryin brand, that link and all the other discount links will be in the video's description. Thanks for watching. Hope that you enjoyed the video. Have a great day.
