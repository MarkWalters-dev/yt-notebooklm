And what this team did is it's a team in Taiwan. They actually looked through a database of the population where they were able to gain access to records, medical records from thousands of people. And what they did is they looked at people who had been taking some of these, you know, over the counter herpes virus medications or, you know, easily prescribed herpes virus medications like Valcyte, you know, frequently prescribed medications. And they looked at those people who had been taking them more often versus people who had not been given those. And they found, that the people taking the antiherpes virus medications had a significantly lower risk of developing dementia over time. In fact, almost a 10 times lower risk of developing dementia by taking these, you know, very widely available herpes virus antivirals. So one of the thing that Ben Reidhead's group is doing, where I showed you the cytotomicelovirus data, is actually just getting together, honestly, the funding and the infrastructure to run a clinical trial of valganciclovir, one of these herpes antivirals in patients with predementia to see if it prevents, you know, progression to Alzheimer's disease. So straightforward possibilities for what can be done.
