About two years ago, I posted a video where I did, 12 full extension full flexion pull ups, chin above the bar. So I figured it was time for an update. So let's see how I'm doing for that. Now, I get that there's a little bit of swinging. I do my best to try to minimize that, but, if you'll notice, again, full flexion, full extension, chin above the bar. So, muscle strength declines during, aging. So at worst, I want to stay the same. At best, I want to get better if I can. Note that pull ups are one component of my, full it's about an eighty minute full body workout. So at some, point, during this month, I'll post, the full video. That was, 10 so far going for number 11. Boom. Got number 11, and, to tie my record for about two years ago, here's number 12. Thanks for watching. See you in the next video.
