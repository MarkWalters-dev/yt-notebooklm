Oh, PSA. PSA is big one too. On the rise? Yeah. We gotta flip that. We gotta reverse that trend quick. Yeah. And and that's another reason I'd suggest, you know, the t and f alpha and aisle six, because, you you know, if PSA is increasing because there is some some small cancerous thing growing, if the pro inflammatory cytokines are increasing over time too, that's another signal that something is going on. We wanna get on top of, you know, faster, sooner than later. Absolutely. PSA free, same. Wait. We can even look at the doubling time for the for your total PSA. Not the free, but if you go up to the total Back to total again? Yeah. So you had values let's see. The trend line is, like, point eight, and then it's, yeah, about double. So that's about double over the past five years. I don't know how I I'd have to look that up. Not an expert on PSA even though I'm familiar and have looked at optimal ranges, but, I mean, values as low as point three are found in youth, so that would be my target. But the five year doubling time, I mean, yours essentially have doubled on average, five years based on the trend line. So I'd have to look that up and see, like, risk based on and how long should it take to double? Should it be thirty years, fifty? I I don't know what I just don't know what that is. That would be interesting to know. Keep me posted. Yeah. So, yeah, PSA free. Percent PSA declining. Yeah. Yeah. Going in the wrong direction. Yeah. That is in the wrong direction. I looked that up the other day. It is going in the wrong direction, but still relatively high. I think if I remember correctly, like, PSA free, percent free being, like, less than 15% or less than 10% was associated with an increased risk of, prostate cancer. So, I mean, yours Yeah. This right here is the high mark of my optimal, so I'm quite a bit higher than optimal. Yeah. I I'd have to look that up, though. I I don't wanna confuse it. You know? That one is not as memorized. It's, still fresh because it's so new. Alright. Testosterone gradually declines with aging. Mine's been increasing. Resisted it. Yeah. So that's another interesting one because had you haven't gotten leaner over the past four years. Right? No. So testosterone's associated with BMI. Leaner BMIs, higher testosterone, and then as BMI increases, testosterone levels drop. So that you haven't gotten leaner, it suggests there's stuff you've added in or or are doing that, has potentially helped you resist, right, age related decline. I mean, I've heard it claimed that you can't take supplements and increase your testosterone. I I think that's wrong. I've actually seen it. I've also seen it in when I run. It seems like when I run, my testosterone increases in in along with the miles that I put in. So, I mean, so my message to a lot of guys out there, instead of just jumping straight to TRT, try you know, get up and take a run sometimes. You know? Just go get physical. You know? Don't it just don't sit so long because that'll drive your t low. Yeah. Or it could be that you've got, you know, you know, conqueror genetics where the more you are, it's good for your testosterone. You know? So I would be curious to see that. I don't know if they've identified those genes yet, have they? Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. Alright. Wait. So free testosterone? Okay. Yeah. So now that's oh, that's terrible. My free testosterone has been quite low because my sex whore hormone binding globulin is pretty high. Yeah. So that's a tricky one. I'm in the same boat. I don't know. So same boat with SHBG being high. And they're just there there are published studies on free tea and all cause mortality risk, but, on the other hand, like, Luigi Fontana studies like calorie restriction, free tea levels drop. And part of his rationale for lower androgen levels in people on CR is that, that may be part of the anti cancer or reduced cancer risk in calorie restricted animals. So maybe that translates into people. I don't know if that's true. And then SHBG is a tricky one because CR increases it dramatically. Exercise increases it, but not as much as CR. So that's, you know, your super exercises. So that's probably a a component of why yours, you know, maybe higher than most. But on the other side of that s SHBG increases during aging. So there's also something besides, you know, exercising and calorie restriction super high. And then it just increases over over time for the average population who's not in that boat, which also that is associated with increased Alzheimer's incidence and, metabolic syndrome. So how can those two do things? How do you square that circle where? I don't know. I I've actually had people tell me that the fact that I'm low in free testosterone is not necessarily a bad thing. Yep. Their way of looking at it was that just means that maybe your cells are uptaking more of it, so it's just not free floating in your serum. Yeah. Which I mean, if that's the case, that would be a good thing. I just don't know how you would measure such a thing. Yeah. So Oh, wait. So SHBG, let's take a look at that. I can keep scrolling down. I know it's in here. Oh, pregnenolone. There's my DHT. So that's going in the well, it's going in the wrong direction for aging, but at least it's to me, it's going in the right direction because it's heading toward my optimal. Yeah. And I like it low to keep the hair thick. So I'm I'm doing things to try to drive DHT down too. So Nice. My estradiol, which has been quite high at times, same with total estrogens, only because I'm, you know, I'm supplementing with pregnenolone and DHEA, which are upstream precursors of both testosterone and estrogen. So to get that high testosterone, I'm gonna get high estrogen right along with it. There's just no, there's no no getting one without the other. But then I'm taking things like, calcium d glucarate and dim to try to bind with the estrogens to move them out. Although, you know, estrogens aren't necessarily a bad thing either. Like, what? Seventeen estradiol is a good thing for men, but you can't really be picky with dim and and calcium to glucarate. They just bind to all of it, not the ones you want. Gotcha. Yeah. So here we go. Here's it's actually one more. Not terribly high. I mean No. Higher than I want. Because this is my here's my green optimal down here. Now I'm outside of the reference range. Yeah. But, I mean, like I said, when considering that vigorous exercise or active people, relatively high VO two maxes have values approximately double the reference range, and then people on CR four fold higher than, you know or not the reference range, but, like, one twenty versus, you know, exercises, I think, if I remember correctly in the paper, it's, like, sixty sixty to 70 for people who are fit and active. So, Yeah. I wouldn't I wouldn't I'm not too worried about SHBG. The thing is there's a biological age clock that includes it so that and it's that clock is as good as pheno age, but just it includes some different markers like SHBG. So that'd be one where I would look older. But is it though is it though really? Right? Because if it's coming from CR and exercise I'm not familiar with that clock. I would love to play with that. What how do I get a hold of that one? It's, longevity tools. If you type in longevitytools.com or in Google. Okay. Yeah. I'll do that. Or at longevity I can almost guarantee you, I'm gonna be watching over, you know, both parts of this video myself and and taking notes since I haven't been doing that while we've been talking. Nice.
