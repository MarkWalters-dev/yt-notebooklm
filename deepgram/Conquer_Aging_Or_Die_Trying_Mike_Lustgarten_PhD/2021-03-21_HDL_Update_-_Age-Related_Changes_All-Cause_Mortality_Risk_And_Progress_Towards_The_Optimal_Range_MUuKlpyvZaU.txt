The largest study ever published in terms of sample size for how HDL changes during aging and its association with all cause mortality risk was published in December 2020. Now I made a a similar video, in November 2020 that obviously didn't include these data. So I think, with the goal of staying current with the literature, I think it's a good idea to go over these more recent data. Now I mentioned that it's the largest study ever for HDL in terms of age related changes and all cause mortality risk, how many subjects were included. And as we can see in the title, 15 the data for fifteen point eight million adults. Now also, besides going over this, the data in this paper, I'm also gonna, detail my progress for HDL in getting it, closer or to within, the optimal range. So first, how does HDL change during aging? And that's what we can see here. HDL on the y axis plotted against age at entry. Now starting with the data for women, in red, we can see that, HDL increases, during youth. It peaks, between twenty four and twenty seven years at about, 64 and then consistently declines, throughout the duration of life. A relatively similar trend is found in men. It increases in youth. It peaks at, between twenty two and twenty three years, at fifty six milligrams per deciliter. There's about a ten ish year decline, into the mid thirties where it then stabilizes at about in the low fifties, 51, 52 for the, remainder of, you know, the next fifty years. So what about all cause mortality risk? So that data is here. The hazard ratio on the y axis, so the relative risk of death for all causes, plotted against the, concentration of HDL in the blood. So first, starting with the data for women in red, we can see that lowest risk for all cause mortality is when HDL was between 50 and 79 milligrams per deciliter. And then in men, a a more narrow range, between fifty and fifty nine was associated with lowest risk of death for all causes. So what about, increased significantly increased risk? So for women, that data was, when HDL was greater than 80, when compared with the 50 to 79. Actually, when compared with 50 to, 59. Sorry. And, having HDL less than 50 in both men and women was associated with a significantly increased all cause mortality risk. So the obvious question is how do these data compare with the previous, meta analysis that I presented in my, November 2020 HDL video. So that data is here. And first note that this is a meta analysis of 24 studies, that included significantly fewer, subjects, you know, 3,400,000 as opposed to 15,800,000. So, nonetheless, the data relatively similar between the two cohorts, and even they differ in terms of, geography. The data I presented on the previous slide is from a Korean cohort whereas the data on this slide is from The US and European cohorts. So let's see, how they compare. So in the meta analysis, we can see that lowest risk of death for all causes for men was when HDL was between fifty two to fifty six milligrams per deciliter. And the data that I just showed you on the previous slide was that, lowest all cause mortality risk was when HDL was between 50 and 59. So relatively similar data. And it looks like independent of geography. How about the women, the data for women all cause mortality? So in the meta analysis, the lowest risk was when HDL was 58 between 58 to 62. And in the data I just showed you, it was a wider range, 50 to 79. But we can see that the that 50 to 79 grouping is still at, you know, at the lowest, u shape of the curve. So it's pretty close to lowest risk of death for all causes. Now I've measured my HDL two more times since the November, 2020 HDL video. So how's my progress in getting into these optimal ranges? So first, in order to assess that, we've gotta look at what my HDL is, and that's what's plotted here. HDL on the y axis against time. So I've measured HDL 36 times since 2008, And there's a wide range. As you can see, I've had values as low as 28 and as high as as 56. So the key is to identify the factors that may be influencing it so that so that I can stay consistently above, 50 as opposed to being consistently closer to 28. Now my average HDL during this time is about 44. And when considering the data that I just presented on the two previous slides, optimal may be somewhere in the 50 to 59 range. So, my average value over the past thirteen years is not optimal. Now I've had values that are higher than 50, between fifty and sixty, on many occasions. So how can I get how can I get there consistently as I just mentioned? Now also note that I've made progress in my last few blood tests in getting it closer to that optimal range. So going from 39 to 40 to 44 and then 49 on my last four measurements. Now in my previous HDL video, I noted, I noticed that, significant correlations between certain foods with my levels of HDL. And those were, saturated fat containing nuts and, omega six containing, nuts or seeds and or seeds. For example, cocoa beans, which I used to make chocolate, coconut butter, sunflower seeds, and walnuts. And, based on the correlations with the not in not not yet presented here, but in the previous video, the, correlations for, cocoa butter and, cocoa beans, cacao were and walnuts were relatively close to, statistical significance for their correlation with HDL. Of of this group, only sunflower seeds were significantly correlated with HDL. So higher levels of sunflower seeds were correlated with a higher HDL. But interestingly, when I took the sum of these nuts and seeds and looked at their correlation with HDL, we can see a strong correlation and a statistically significant strong correlation which suggests that the higher my intake of these nuts, the higher my HDL would be. So that data was from two blood tests ago. And if these correlations are real, we'd expect to see with, relatively higher intakes that, we should see strong correlation. So what do those correlations look like two blood tests later? So, interestingly for cocoa beans and coconut butter, the magnitude of the correlations, the r, the little r, is about the same. But now the correlation between cocoa beans with HDL is statistically significant. Similarly, the sunflower seeds is still statistically significant with a moderately strong correlation. And coconut butter is about the same, you know, two blood tests ago to now in terms of their, correlation and statistical significance. However, I purposely reduced my walnut intake prior to my last blood test. And when considering that my HDL actually went up, you can see that the correlation between walnuts with my HDL correspondingly reduced where it's it's, further away from statistical significance. Nonetheless, when I still take the sum of these four knots and look at their correlation with HDL, we can see a, strong correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.78 and a statistically significant p value. Now with this in mind, in going forward, I'm gonna maintain my intake of these nuts and seeds and try to increase them if I can, because I'm already eating probably eighty grams or more of these, per day. So with this in mind, there must be other factors that can influence my HDL. So what would those be? Now, I noticed an interesting, correlation between my average daily sodium intake with HDL, which is what we see plotted here. So So the higher my average daily sodium intake, the higher my HDL, the correlation, for a higher HDL. And this correlation is statistically statistically significant as you can see by the p value. Now, sodium can be found in many foods. So, more specifically, which foods may may, account for this correlation. So, potential candidates, include what's listed here and this is, based on my, foods that I've consumed over the past four weeks and my average daily sodium intake for each of these foods. So I I rarely eat processed food. It's an almost never thing for me. So, to keep my, so sodium intake closer to the high end of my range here, which is about twenty six hundred milligrams per day, I've been adding a couple of grams of salt, which add obviously sodium to my total intake. But other significant sources are pickles of sodium are pickles, carrots, sardines, broccoli, yogurt, beets, and spinach. So the obvious question is, are any of these foods independently associated or correlated, sorry, with HDL? And, of all of the list of these eight foods, the only one that it that there's a significant correlation with HDL is pickles or r pickles with a correlation coefficient of 0.75 and a statistically significant p value. So with this in mind and to maintain my you know, going forward to get my HDL above 50, if if this is a real correlation, if I maintain a relatively high pickle intake or increase it, thereby keeping my total sodium intake, greater than twenty four hundred milligrams per day, I should expect to see, HDL values that are higher than 50, at least based on extrapolation of the curve, the graph, the, the trend line, based on what we see there. Now, alternatively, someone could say, well, sure. Increasing your HDL from 44 to 50 or in the 50 to 59 range, you know, maybe you've changed a number. But have you actually changed anything physiologically? Is it is it clinically relevant to see a that relatively small of a change, to, you know, to improve overall health? So I'd argue yes. And to to, help determine that, I'm gonna look at the correlation for HDL with, a lipoprotein called lipoprotein a and, high sensitivity c c reactive protein, CRP. So first, lipoprotein a, also known as l p little a, which I'll show, in a second. So what is it? So, as a simple explanation, it's an LDL like particle that contains an apolipoprotein a protein, in its in its core. So, higher relatively high higher levels of lipoprotein a are associated with myocardial infarction, heart attack, ischemic stroke, so stroke, and atherosclerotic stenosis, so atherosclerosis. So having higher levels of lipoprotein a in the blood are seemingly bad for health. Interestingly, for me, higher levels of HDL are correlated with lower, a lower lipoprotein a. And this is data from 2009, so twelve years of data. 19 blood tests. And we can see, a significant a statistically significant correlation between HDL and, LPA, Lipoprotein a in my data. Now, my average Lipoprotein a, during this twelve year period is 38.4 milligrams per deciliter. So how does that look in terms of risk, in terms of risk for having a heart attack, stroke, and atherosclerosis? So in terms of heart attack and atherosclerosis, there's increased risk for those outcomes when Lipoprotein a is greater than 30 milligrams per deciliter for both. And as we can see, my average value is higher than that. So and also note that 18 of the 19 measurements over the past twelve years, I've had higher lipoprotein a values than 30 milligrams per deciliter on 18 out of 19 occasions. So this is not good. It's definitely, not good. Now what about stroke? So in terms of, risk for stroke, it it's increased when lipoprotein a is greater than 50 milligrams per per deciliter. Now fortunately, I've only had one of the 19 measurements that have been higher than 50. But, I had three or so measurements that were in the mid forties. So, I definitely want the don't want this to to increase, and I've gotta get it going in the right direction in terms of decreasing it. So based on the correlation here between HDL with lipoprotein a, it looks like the higher my HDL, the lower my lipoprotein a. And, in fact, when h HDL looks like it's greater than 50, that looks like the magic cutoff for having a lipoprotein a less than 30. So if I can get my HDL consistently above 50, I'd expect to lower Lipoprotein a and correspondingly reduce my risk of, heart attack and atherosclerosis. So what about, the correlation for HDL with high sensitivity CRP? Now I presented this data in my last HDL video and there was a relatively, moderately strong correlation, inverse correlation. So higher HDL, lower levels of, high sensitivity CRP. So how does the data look two blood tests later? And it's basically almost identical in terms of its correlation and its, p value. So from this, it it looks like the higher my HDL, the lower my my high sensitivity CRP will be. Now, I presented this in another video and I'll link to all these papers, in the description high sensitivity CRP less than 0.3 may be optimal. So how can I get to that, level of high high sensitivity CRP consistently? Again, extrapolating based on the trend line, we can see that having an HDL greater than 50 is correlated with having a CRP HSCRP lower than 0.3. So, with considering everything I've shown here in the video, that peak HDL for men and and youth is 56, That 50 to 59 is associated with a reduced all cause mortality risk. And then based on the correlations for HDL with liprotein a and high sensitivity CRP, raising HDL to greater than 50, at least in my case, may be beneficial for health. So that's all I've got for now. If you made it to the end, thanks a lot. I hope you enjoyed the video and have a great day.
