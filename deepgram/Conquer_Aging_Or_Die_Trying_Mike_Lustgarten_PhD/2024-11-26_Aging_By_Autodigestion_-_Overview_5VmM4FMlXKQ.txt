I'd summarize it here with a diagram, with a cartoon. Under normal circumstances, our food that we eat is digested in the lumen of the intestine, and it's not elsewhere. The intact mucin layer is responsible for that protection, and it follows the traditional physiology that one learns in gastroenterology. If, however, we allow a autodigestion to occur, then in that particular case, it starts by a breakdown of the barrier. The bullae may be digested away altogether. Digestive enzymes now get out. They can leave through blood vessels. They can leave through lymphatics. And on the lymphatic pathway, actually, they bypass the liver. And they could leave directly across the entire wall of the small intestine and appear in the in the, extracellular fluid. So in essence, digestive enzymes can escape through all pathways. Once this occurs, the systemic circulation is affected, and we are dealing with a multiorgan dysfunction.
