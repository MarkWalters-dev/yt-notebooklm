You have deficits in red blood cells, red bell red blood cell number. You're gonna have lower hemoglobin because hemoglobin is found in red blood cells. Hemoglobin carries oxygen. Your tissues aren't gonna be as properly oxygenated. Actually, in your cells aren't gonna be as properly oxygenated as they should be. So HBOT within that context, you're essentially forcing oxygen into your body and potentially improving aerobic metabolic metabolism because now it has oxygen that it didn't have before. So that might be part of the reason why he says things like HBOT improves my biomarkers. Maybe it's because he's his hemoglobin is lower than it should be. That said, at his chronological age, his hemoglobin is, he's gotta figure out how to reverse that.
