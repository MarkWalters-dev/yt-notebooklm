Yeah. Oxidized LDL. That wasn't good. But, again, no. That wasn't that wasn't too long ago. That was still 2024, though. I haven't tested that in a while. Yeah. I think the two tests that I or the three yeah. Two tests that I have for this were both done at my cardiologist's office. So So the question there would be, is it so high LDL will shift the reaction to the right, more high oxidized LDL, but then if there's if if your LDL levels aren't high and ox oxidative stress is high, that'll also shift the reaction to the right for high oxidized LDL. So, some of some of Viola's ratios can be used to assess, oxidative stress. So methionine methionine sulfoxide divided by methionine, cysteine divided by cysteine, nitrotyrosine divided by tyrosine. These are, these ratios are indicative of elevated oxidative stress higher levels. So, that could be something to look into. You know? Is it an oxidative stress story? Is this a reduced LDL story? And then you raised a good point. Is it related to, my my exercise regimen? Because I I do know, that I don't know, you know, necessarily which day of the week I particularly do my blood testing. But, when I do my blood testing, I'm generally sore, and I can't do a workout. So I will try to get a heavy workout in the day before often, which I'm sure is probably skewing the data for some of this stuff. Yeah. I mean, if your data is ten year younger pheno age on average, and that's with doing a hard workout the day before, I wonder maybe it's fifteen years younger if you're not. Or and then what's your best data too? You know, just like longevity World Cup. If your best data is 16.6, you know, maybe That was my that was my best. Yeah. But that I've had other points close, but that was my best one. But that's with the hard workout the day before on most days. That one may may have been may not be eight. I I wouldn't be sure on that. Yeah. But I'm gonna need to pay attention to that. Yeah. Again, I I would be I was doing it for practical reasons. Right? I wanna be able to get a good workout in. And so if I get if I get, you know, the puncture in the I don't know, like, I can't because I'm gonna end up with a hematoma then if I'm starting to, you know, move weights the next day. Oh, I I I blood test in the morning, and every every blood test day, I do my usual ninety minute workout, like, no problem. Oh, do you really? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've given myself a hematoma before by doing that. That's interesting because, there are days when I might be squeezing, like, too hard. So so not necessarily hematoma, but the bruising, you know, so that's obviously not good to, you know, to but that's generally a function of how good the phlebotomist is. If she's or Faye, I shouldn't say she, but if they're jamming the needle, you know, too hard, that oh god. That's like murder. I may have told you this before, but, I mean, my veins are so flat. I do a lot I do a lot of sauna, so it kinda melts away the subcutaneous fat, and it makes my arms look great. They're very, very vascular. My friends are always asking me, you know, how do you get that veiny look in your arms? I said, well, really, I I can't take credit. It's the sauna, I think, that's doing that. But it makes that, vein compressed. It just flattens the vein. Mhmm. And I always warn the people when they go to give me the, you know, the needle that, look. You gotta go in at a very steep angle. Otherwise, you're gonna go straight through. And most of the young people listen to me. It's the older ladies, like, the retired ladies that work at the Red Cross Center. They're always like, son, I've been drawing blood for thirty years. I think I know what I'm doing. You know? And then every single time, they screw it up. They go straight through the vein, out the other side, and hematoma right away. Oh, gosh. Yeah. That's really what made me stop donating blood at the Red Cross and started donating at plasma centers because they listen to me at plasma centers. You know? They're they have an incentive to actually get the blood. With the Red Cross ladies, they don't care if they draw the blood or not. So So when they went through your vein, what happened afterwards was was, like, just profusely or they're profusely apologizing? What, what happened there? No. I mean, they blame me. They blame my veins are bad. Ah. So I actually have like, if I go into the Red Cross today, they'll probably pull up my records, and they'll see all the failed attempts, which were their fault, not mine. And they say, oh, no. Yeah. We're not even gonna try to draw from you. You you're undrawable. And I just laugh at them because then I could just go over to the plasma center and donate just fine, and they'll pay me. So So usually vascularity is not I mean, granted, I haven't done sauna, so I don't know what effect it would have. But if you're, I mean, you're super lean. So if you have, obviously, for people who have more body fat, it'd be harder to find the vein. But because you're so lean and the the skin covering, you know, the the the area is so thin, it should be easy to be vascular. It's easy to spot the vein, but because the vein is so compressed. Mhmm. It's it's not, like, nice and fat like it should be because of all the subcutaneous fat that it can ride in. So it's, like, compressed between the the muscle and the skin, and so they have to hit it at a real steep angle. Yeah. And then in terms of sauna, like, wouldn't that vasodilate you? It should open up your blood vessels, not constrict them. Yeah. In the course of the sauna. But, you know, afterwards, I think after after cooling down, it sort of melts away that fat. So Yeah.
