For NAD test number seven, I decided to go away from the de novo NAD synthesis pathway and go back to the salvage pathway where for two of the seven tests, I used NMN. But instead of using NMN for this test, I decided to use n a or nicotinic acid, a form of niacin as a means for increasing NAD. So for this test, did six hundred milligrams per day of niacin impact NAD? And to assess that, I sent blood to GINFINITY for analysis and if you wanna measure your own N A D levels, discount link in the video's description. Alright. Jumping right into it, my N A D level was 67, point four micromolar which is my highest N A D level yet. So that raises a few questions. How does this test compare with earlier tests? Why did I decide to use niacin? And then is sixty seven micromolar high enough? So first, how does this test sixty seven micromolar compare with earlier tests? And what we're gonna see here is my NED journey. This is from January to July 2023, seven tests. For the first test, my baseline, this was without n l an r, n m n, niacin, b six, grape seed as a source of proanthocyanidins, none of that, just my baseline, Twenty five point six micromolar. So then I took three hundred milligrams per day of NMN and it didn't move my NED levels at all. Essentially, the same twenty five point three micromolar. So then thinking the dose wasn't high enough, I decided to go with a thousand milligrams per day of NMN and that finally raised my NED levels to 39. So then I thought, well, I haven't really identified or addressed the root of the problem why NED is low in the first place. So then I shifted my attention to the de novo n a d synthesis path pathway as I showed on the earlier slide where I did three experiments. The first was, b six, adding more supplemental, b six because as I showed in an earlier video, there's an age related decrease for b six and if b six levels are low, you can't convert or you can't efficiently convert tryptophan into NAD. So increasing my b six intake by about 3.5 fold, move the needle in the right direction, 30. But as we saw on the next test after that and with a higher b six dose, it The b six didn't impact my NED. The average over those two tests, twenty six micromolar essentially close to my baseline and that's with up to a 12 fold increase for vitamin b six. So then thinking that the age related block may be with quinoline or converting quinoline into NAD, I then used grape seed powder as a source of proanthocyanidins which have been shown to increase NAD in rats and mice But for me, that didn't work at all. As you can see, my NAD levels were their lowest or the lowest that they've been over those six tests, nineteen point nine micromolar, which then brings us to niacin. So I returned to the salvage pathway because I wanted to go away from the day nova pathway because that didn't work and I wanted to go to get actually improvement. I wanted to see improvement knowing that NMN improved my data. I wanted to try niacin to see how that would react. And there's more on why I decided to go with niacin in a minute. So we can see that using niacin, I got my highest reading yet of 67 micromolar. So then why niacin? I'm not gonna focus on niacin versus NMN or NR, only focusing on niacin's potential strengths and as they apply to me. So in this study that was published in 2020, it was shown that niacin cures NAD deficiency and this was both in controls and in people who had adult onset mitochondrial myopathy. And that's what we can see here. So on the y axis, we've got whole blood levels of NAD plotted against time and this was a ten month study with, blood sent for NAD analysis at the four and ten month time point. The study included controls. There were and this is a relatively small study of, 10 controls and five patients with an average age of fifty to fifty one years. So then both were fed a thousand, a thousand milligrams of niacin per day and for both groups, we can see that there was a five to six fold increase for circulating levels of NAD. Now niacin increased NADP which is NAD but with a phosphate group added. It also increased NADP too And that's what we can see here. NADP levels on the y axis and again plotted against time. And this time only in in the controls, there was a significant 20% increase for NADP levels. So why is NADP important? Why am I highlight highlighting this? Why do I care about NADP? NADP is important because to produce DHEA from cholesterol, it requires NADPH or the reduced version of NADP, and that's what we'll see here. So starting with cholesterol, cholesterol is converted by five enzymatic steps as shown in blue into DHEA or dehydroepiandrosterone. And then and then note that DHEA sulfation, so adding a sulfur group to DHEA produces DHEA sulfate. So the importance of DHEA sulfate is that besides being the most abundant androgen in men, its levels decline during aging and relatively low levels are associated with an increased all cause mortality risk. And I won't go over that data in this video because I covered it in an earlier video. So if you're interested, it'll be in the right corner. Now also note that as a cofactor in each of these five reactions as shown in red is NADPH. In other words, if NAD is low, NADP would probably also be low. And if NADP is low, the conversion of cholesterol into DHEA will be inefficient, potentially resulting in a low DHEA sulfate level. Now, in support of that hypothesis when considering my NAD levels have been low, my DHEA sulfate levels have indeed declined during aging and that's what we'll see here. So I had two tests in 2005 and over those two tests, my average DHEA sulfate was 300 micromolar and then note that over the past 23 tests over the last year, most of those with CyFOX but the last seven or so using venipuncture, we can see that my average DHEA sulfate level is a 117 micrograms per deciliter which is low based on age related changes and all cause mortality risk. Now, for this most recent blood test, my DHEA sulfate levels weren't any better, a 114 micrograms per deciliter even though NAD increased from 25 to 67 micromolar which then raises the question, you know, for the next NAD test, if I increase NAD further, will I finally get an increase for DHEA sulfate? Now if that's not the case, I can pretty much cross off that it's NAD as a limiting factor, for having low relatively low levels of DHEA sulfate and then I can go back to focusing on either raising blood levels of cholesterol. Maybe it's possible that I have too low levels for blood levels of cholesterol so less of that is being converted into DHEA sulfate or I may have a problem self with sulfation and converting DHEA into DHEA sulfate. So you doing the NAD, testing can help me clarify aspects of that hypothesis. Alright. So to raise NAD, will I just go higher for niacin? Just increasing it above six hundred milligrams per day? So for at least one more test in contrast, I'll return to the de novo NAD synthesis pathway as shown here. So why why will I do that? So I mentioned earlier that up to 12 times higher, for vitamin b six, pyridoxal five phosphate p five p had no effect on NED. That suggests in my case, I may not have an age related block there. Similarly, when I use grape seed powder as a source of proanthocyanidins, that didn't impact my NED levels either. In fact, it actually reduced my NAD levels, when compared with my baseline. So when considering that I may not have an age related block at b six or convert in converting a quinolinic acid into NAD, maybe there are no age related blocks in my de novo NAD synthesis pathway. Now to test that, if I supplement with tryptophan, I could end up raising NAD. Now, my current tryptophan intake is one gram per day and that data is provided by Cronometer. There will also be a discount link in the video's description if you wanna track your own diet using Cronometer. So when considering my current intake is one gram per day, for the next test, NAD test, I'll supplement with an additional one gram per day so I'll double my current tryptophan dose while not changing the niacin dose. So one gram of tryptophan plus another six hundred of niacin and we'll see if I'm able to further increase NAD and potentially increase, DHEA sulfate. So I sent blood for analysis yesterday. So this the results should be in in the next week or so. So stay tuned for that data in a future video. Alright. That's all for now.
