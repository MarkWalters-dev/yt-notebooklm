About five years ago I started eating one meal a day and, yeah, I basically just eat once a day. What? In this video I'm gonna talk about what has happened and what are my thoughts about this one meal a day or OMAD. If you're new here then make sure you click like and subscribe as well. I make videos about just the biohacking, health and the performance. Besides this one meal a day, I've been doing intermittent fasting as a thing since high school and I was 18 at that time when I started and by now I've been doing it for like up to eight years. The biggest reason I had started doing it was just because of the body composition aspect and the fitness. But, as I kept going with that, I also kinda started to realize about the other health benefits that you get from intermittent fasting. During the first four years of intermittent fasting, I was doing the sixteen to eight method where you fast for sixteen hours and you eat maybe two to three meals in an eight hour window. This is my first, let's say, body composition progress picks that I took, right when I was in the middle of the military. And, at that time, I did have to be, like, eating relatively, like, three meals a day, but I never had, like, snacks or something. So I did still do some sort of, like, this time machine eating. And I fasted still about, like, fourteen hours every day. After I had done four years of intermittent fasting, I started to experiment with slightly longer fasts, like twenty four hour fasts, forty eight hour fasts, and, yeah, I went through to just stumbled upon the one meal a day as well. When I first started doing one meal a day, then I weighed about, seventy two or seventy three kilograms. And, after five years of doing this one meal a day, I'm approximately seventy nine kilograms or something. And, my body composition has stayed relatively the same all the time. I've never gone fat. I've never lost, you know, a bunch of muscle. I've stayed approximately the same body composition all the time. Today, after five years, I am seventy nine kilograms and I've just progressively increased my muscle mass. I've progressively gotten stronger at the gym as well. Like, I do a lot of, calisthenics, weighted calisthenics as well as, gym workouts. But my, yeah, like, best lift examples would be, like, I can do a pull up with a with a plus 80 kilograms strapped onto my belt, and that gives me, like, 101% of my, you know, own body weight, which is, you know, quite significant. So it's not like that the one minute a day has kind of interfered with my muscle growth or my gym performance. I've still managed to build muscle and get stronger as well in the in in the process despite eating one meal a day. Another example is, dips. I can also do, plus 80 kilogram dips for reps, not just once, like several times. And, yeah, it's just another example that, you can still keep getting stronger. Wait a minute. However, just one meal a day itself, if you just eat once a day within, like, one hour period, that is definitely not gonna be the most optimal thing for Moscow. Then that's what I've also, let's say, overcome. Like, I fixed I improved upon the regular one meal a day, by doing this what I call targeted intermittent fasting. And basically, what it means is that I still eat once a day, but during the daytime when I'm working out, I have, like, a protein shake, basically. And that protein shake gives me, like, an additional intake of, protein, and that's gonna help me to improve muscle mass. It's gonna help me to build muscle and make progress at the gym as well. So, if I were to be only doing one meal a day without the protein shake, then I would wouldn't probably be, you know, as strong and as big as I am, but having the protein shake helps me to overcome this limitation because, yeah, like, one meal a day is still very short time period where you could eat your protein. Whereas the targeted intermittent fasting that I created or call it like that, overcomes this limitation. This is what I talk about in my book, Metabolic Catology as well. And, the purpose of the book is to kinda help you to improve your body composition and fitness as well as longevity with some times you're eating and the resistance training. So it kinda blends together both the longevity and antiaging side with the bodybuilding. So, you can basically make gains and improve your longevity as a process. Awesome. I love protein. What I've also noticed is that, it's not like I don't feel like I'm suffering if I'm trying to lose body weight or lose body fat, because, like I said, one way a day, like, during the fasting period, when you're fasting during daytime, you don't really get that hungry because your body gets so fat adapted. You go into deep ketosis. You You use your own body fat for fuel very easily. Like, you know, during daytime, I'm always always in the zone. I'm, highly productive. I'm focused. I don't get cravings. I don't get distracted. And I'm able to just work and, you know, just enjoy my meal in the evening without getting hungry during daytime. So that's one of the biggest pluses and the biggest advantages of the one meal a day is that you become very keto adapted and very fat adapted. So your body uses your body fat for fuel very efficiently. And because of that same reason, you it's also easy to lose the body fat or cut down on the calories. So you can reduce your calorie intake from that one meal without feeling that you're suffering because you can still eat, like, this massive meal in the evening, without feeling that you're, like, in a calorie deficit and without feeling that you're dieting. Where's the pizza? Some people may find it harder to build muscle with it, because of their forced to eat more calories, and it's hard for them to do. But like I said, you can you you can play around with it like I like I did. So you add the protein shake or you just eat two meals a day. Like, there was no, like, real huge difference between, two meals a day and one meal a day, in terms of, like, the longevity benefits or something. There's definitely, like, a difference in terms of the muscle anabolism. Of course, eating two meals a day may provide you with more muscle anabolism. But, in terms of the autophagy or, the longevity benefits, then, two meals, one meal a day isn't necessarily that, different. I just like one meal a day. It's just easy. You just eat once a day. Last year in 2020, I was about seventy seven kilograms or one hundred and seventy pounds. So I've gained a little bit of muscle because of focusing more on lifting weights. Resistance training is the best or the most important thing when it comes to building muscle, especially if you're doing fasting or when you're in a calorie deficit. Like, you're never gonna build muscle unless you lift weights or unless you do resistance training. And, the resistance training is also the biggest thing that is helping you to preserve muscle when you're in a calorie deficit or when you're fasting. So, yeah, I don't think that one meal a day is definitely something that everyone should do and it's definitely not like, the optimal way of doing it for a lot of people and it's not preferable for a lot of people. It's just what I enjoy. It kinda suits my lifestyle and, it kinda hasn't impeded. It hasn't interfered with my physical fitness. It hasn't interfered with my mental focus. It hasn't interfered with my, like, mental well-being. It's actually improved everything. So, I'm definitely gonna keep going. And if you want to learn more about it, then I've actually written a book about it as well called Metabolic Autophagy that is very in-depth about all the science behind, this intermittent fasting and autophagy, as well as how do you structure your intermittent fasting routine based upon your goals. Or you can also check out my metabolic methodology master class, which is a thirteen hour video course that is walks you through all this, scientific process as well as give you some actual guidelines and a meal plan with what foods to eat, in what amounts, when, how do you train, etcetera, etcetera.
