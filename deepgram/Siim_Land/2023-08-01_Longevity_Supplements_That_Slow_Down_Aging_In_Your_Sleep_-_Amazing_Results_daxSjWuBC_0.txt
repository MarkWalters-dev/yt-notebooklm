Sleep is incredibly important for slowing down aging and living longer. In fact, most of the longevity pathways that your body has are activated in your sleep. So if you want to really optimize it, then there are many things you can do to improve the effectiveness of your sleep and promote its antiaging qualities even further. So in this video, I'm gonna give you three supplements that help you to slow down aging in your sleep. It's showtime. So the story begins millions of years ago, if you would like to put it that way, because we're gonna start with melatonin. It's called the sleep hormone. And a good discovery to start with, to put it into context, is from 2009 where they took Greater White toothed Shoe, which is this small nocturnal insectivorous mammal, and they started giving them melatonin at around 12 of age. This animal obviously lives a lot shorter than humans and it starts to show the signs of aging around 12 of age, mainly through the loss of circadian rhythm in its activities. And that actually what happens in humans as well. Humans lose some of the circadian robustness with age and they start to produce less of the circadian hormones, specifically melatonin and cortisol, which leads to, like, this perpetual jet lag and shift work for the elderly people that reduces the sleep quality and also starts to age them a lot faster. Once you stop producing melatonin that much, which happens naturally with age, and once you start to see a derailment in your circadian rhythms, that's the point where you start to see an acceleration, like a greater acceleration in your aging process because you don't have melatonin that would repair your body and that would keep it in check, if that makes sense. So in this study, they started continuously administering melatonin starting a little bit before twelve months and that the appearance of these first signs of aging were delayed by at least three months. Having higher levels of melatonin around this time specifically or throughout your entire lifetime generally, especially the older you get especially, you know, when you reach the elderly years, is going to have a positive effect in slowing down some of the aging process because you postpone this inflection point where you stop producing melatonin and where you start to age much faster. Sucks. And based on this study, actually, melatonin appears to have some quite interesting effects in terms of mimicking some of the benefits of calorie restriction and fasting. There is a connection between calorie restriction and melatonin levels in the gastrointestinal tract. So your, gastrointestinal tract produces actually almost 400% more melatonin than the pineal gland, which is, quite interesting. Several experiments indicate that fasting in animals substantially increased their production of gastrointestinal melatonin. So melatonin released by the gastrointestinal tract and when you are fasting or when you are under calorie restriction, your gastrointestinal tract produces a lot of melatonin. And, apparently, some of the health benefits and the longevity benefits of calorie restriction and fasting might be mediated by the increase in gastrointestinal melatonin levels besides all the other things, like, of course, fasting and calorie restriction increase your energy levels. They slow down aging in many other ways, but, probably part of it is also due to the gastrointestinal melatonin increase. A daily intake of melatonin before bedtime might achieve the same effect as fasting, e. G. An increase of body melatonin levels, which will protect the individual from the ravages of old age. Son of a I do think that melatonin has a quite important role in many aspects of antiaging and longevity. And, coincidentally, because the connection of the gastrointestinal melatonin levels, you could also see that why the earlier time of your eating in many studies appears to be much more beneficial for your health and longevity than eating very late or doing night shift work or eating at nighttime, for example. So if you're not eating, you have a slightly hungrier stomach, your stomach is empty, therefore, you will produce more melatonin. You enter the semi calorie restricted state and semi fasted state before bed and that will exponentially increase how much gastrointestinal melatonin your body produces before bed. And as a result of that, you go through a lot more of the repair processes in your sleep if you're hungrier. Of course, you don't need to be doing some very severe early time machine eating. You don't need to stop eating at 1PM. You can still have, like, relatively normal dinner, but I will suggest you stop eating around 5PM or 6PM to fully reap the benefits of going to bed with a slightly emptier stomach. There's also evidence to support melatonin as a potential antiaging therapy for age rated cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. So melatonin has obviously many neuroprotective effects because it's very powerful anti inflammatory antioxidant, and because of that, it also has has cardiovascular, cardio predictive effects. Interestingly, melatonin also appears to have some skin antiaging benefits or at least it helps to protect the skin against DNA damage and oxidative stress and, even UV damage. So, melatonin having, you know, proper melatonin levels protects your skin against the UV radiation. And lastly, melatonin even has anti senescence effects. So senescence cells are these zombie cells. But are there any, like, side effects? Well, melatonin as a supplement in even in high doses in the elderly people has been found to be beneficial for improving sleep quality and sleep effectiveness. So in this study, they compared a smaller dose of zero point three milligrams of melatonin versus a high dose of five milligrams of melatonin which is quite, quite large. They did find that even zero point three milligrams of melatonin had a trend towards increasing sleep efficiency but the five milligrams of melatonin significantly increased sleep efficiency. Of course, the biggest fear people have about melatonin is that it's going to shut down your natural melatonin production, but, that's actually not true. It's like very common misconception about melatonin. It doesn't appear to have any, like, negative feedback loop. And even supplementing zero point five milligrams or even up to fifty milligrams for thirty seven days in a row didn't appear to, change or inhibit natural melatonin production or the melatonin circadian rhythm. So there's nothing to really worry about that your body would somehow stop producing its natural melatonin levels. But based on this 2022 review, there appears to be some desensitization of melatonin receptors, which means that over time, you might need, like, a larger dose to get the same effect. So you would still want to stay to a slightly lower dose or the, like, minimal effective dose as needed, and the lower doses range from zero point three to two milligrams. The European Food Safety Authority recommends the use of maximum doses of zero point three to one milligrams. Now the best melatonin brand I like to use is Herbartonin, which, is actually like a plant melatonin. It's made of phytomelatonin from rice, alfalfa and chlorella. And there is actually studies comparing phytomelatonin to synthetic melatonin, so the one that you would get from the pharmacy, and they have found that the COX-two inhibitory act activity of the phytomelatonin was found to be circa 6.5 times stronger than that of the synthetic melatonin. So the plant melatonin is very potent in its antioxidant and anti inflammatory potential and effects. And if you want to try out the herbutonin, the phytomelatonin, then head over to symphoninaturalhealth dot com and use the code SIEM 10 for a 10% discount. Now the other supplements that you want to add to your sleep stack are glycine and n a c. The reason being is that your antioxidant activity actually peaks in your nighttime. When you're sleeping, your body is repairing itself the most together with melatonin as well as all the other antioxidant defense mechanisms. Glutathione is considered the master antioxidant inside the body and glycine plus NAC are one of the main precursors for producing glutathione. Studies on the supplementation of glycine and NAC have shown that it does help to slow down the development of hormones of aging and age related conditions. So the perfect sleep stack, in my opinion, for everyday use even would be, like, zero point three milligrams of melatonin, the phytomelatonin before bed together with one gram of NAC and three grams of glycine. Glycine will have additional sleep promoting benefits like it's going to lower your body temperature, is also going to promote GABA activation, which is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter. So if you are someone who has wound up thoughts or very stressed out lifestyle, then adding three to five grams of glycine even before bed is going to help you to calm down your mind. It's going to relax your body, and it also promotes the anti inflammatory and antioxidant benefits in your sleep. Let me know in the comments if you have tried this stack.
