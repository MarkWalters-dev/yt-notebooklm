Welcome back to the channel. My name is Sim Lund, and in this video, I wanna talk about how did I build about 12 to 13 or 14 kilograms of muscle by eating only one meal a day. And I've been doing that for the last five years or so. I've I've been doing intermittent fasting itself for up to eight years, and despite that I've still managed to see this gradual progression in my muscle mass and strength, despite eating one meal a day. So in this video, I'm gonna talk about how did I do it, what is my routine right now, and, what else can you learn about muscle growth as well as interval fasting.

This picture on the left is where I started to do a more like a one millet diet version, and transitioned over from the sixteen and eight method to this version that I created myself. I'll describe it how it works shortly. But, yeah, on the right is where where I've been doing that for maybe one year or so, and on the left I'm maybe 22, 21 years old, somewhere between there, and on the right 23, 24 years old. This is another year, maybe like the second and third year of doing that one milady diet on the left, maybe 24 years old, 23, somewhere between there. And my weight here on the left was maybe seventy five, seventy six, seventy seven kilograms or something like that. And on the right is, the fourth year, third or fourth year in between there, and my weight here is about seventy eight and seventy nine kilograms. These are kind of the, more recent ones. On the left, I weigh eighty five, and on the right, I was the kind of the heaviest, eighty six kilograms, and and these are twenty twenty one. This picture is kind of the latest picture that I've taken. I am a bit leaner, here on the, on these pictures. I weigh about, like, eighty four kilograms or something like that, so it's a bit less body weight than on this one. But, yeah, it's still year five of doing one minute diet. You crazy son of a bitch, you're dead. So how did I did it? I'm gonna start off with basically describing the process of muscle growth itself and what are the main criteria, what are the main factors that contribute to that. Generally, you know, whether or not you build muscle or lose muscle is determined by the balance between muscle growth and muscle breakdown on a twenty four hour period, and your your body is always, you know, synthesizing protein and breaking it down in some aspects and cycling on a daily basis between the activities that you do. Muscle synthesis is is promoted by things like, you know, eating protein, eating calories, even resistance training does that. And muscle breakdown is governed by, you know, fasting, calorie restriction, low protein intake, excess cardio, and those kinds of things. And if you are in a surplus, then you will end up building, muscle. And if you're in a decline deficit in terms of the breakdown, then you will lose muscle. How much protein can your body synthesize in a given meal is limited to a particular amount of protein. So, yeah, if you eat, let's say, 20 grams of protein, then you will stimulate as much protein synthesis as you would if you ate 40 grams of protein and 30 grams or 50 grams or 60 grams. So if you are eating your entire day's worth of protein in one meal, like 100 to 150 grams in one meal, then you're not going to see this exponentially higher expression of protein synthesis compared to eating only 20 or 30 grams of protein because it kind of caps off, it hits a threshold after which you don't see increased protein synthesis, and that obviously will impose some limitations to eating one meal a day or two meals a day even because, you're not going to be able to compensate for the lack of, protein intake during the fasting window even if you are eating your entire day's worth of protein in one meal compared to eating them that same amount of protein spread out. So you spread out your protein then you're gonna naturally be able to stimulate the protein synthesis more often. So this is the exact picture that I described. Four meals, if you eat 40 grams of protein four times a day, which is gonna consider to be the optimal amount or the maximum required amount for naturals to maximize protein protein synthesis with meals, four meals, then, yeah, you will stimulate the protein synthesis four times a day and keeps the body in this relatively anabolic state all the time. Whereas if you do it twice a day or once a day, then even if you're eating seventy five grams, let's say per meal, then, you're not going to be stimulating more protein synthesis than you would by eating 40 grams or 30 or 20 grams. So, yeah, obviously if you want to maximize muscle growth and muscle hypertrophy, then having a higher eating frequency is gonna be relevant. And, it is true that eating only one meal a day is hard. It's gonna be harder to build muscle with, although it's still possible. And, that's why, you know, I personally don't think that the regular one meal a day diet to where you are literally eating only one meal a day is, optimal or suitable for muscle growth. I've I've tried the regular one meal a day where you are literally only eating one meal a day within, like, an hour or so and it's not, as effective as other versions, at least for like muscle growth. And that's why I've also created my own version of the one meal a day diet which I call targeted intermittent fasting. And essentially what it is is that you still eat one meal a day, you eat the majority of calories in one meal, but during the daytime you have, like, a protein shake, either, like, before a workout or usually during the workouts. I personally usually take it during the workout and the goal is to stimulate, to provide another surge of protein synthesis for, you know, protein synthesis and the muscle growth as well as reduce the breakdown. Because if you were to be working out fasted and working out without any protein and any acids in your system, then you would be naturally a bit more catabolic in terms of breaking down more muscle protein. Whereas if you have this protein in your system, then, you're naturally going to help with, the anabolic processes that are required for growth. And this has been, like, the best thing for my physique development in terms of being able to still practice one meal a day and at the same time progress in, my, like, you know, strength and muscle mass. It's definitely may it may not be better than, like, two meals a day. It may not be better than four meals a day, but it, like, at least would work for me. Like, I just like to do one meal a day because of the convenience and not having to worry about eating, and the protein shake is just like a quick fix to, still, make sure that I'm, able to make gains at the same time. Awesome. So how does it look like? For me, it's generally like this. So this is the pre workout period, which, usually lasts, like, maybe sixteen to eighteen hours, approximately eighteen hours every day. So I fast eighteen hours every day. Then I break the fast with this protein shake. Usually, it has 30 grams of protein, like a one scoop of whey protein and some essential amino acids, which will also help with, the same as the protein with more of this, anabolism and reducing catabolism. Plus I also have, like, some creatine, maybe some, you know, some pre workout supplements like, citrulline, dextrose not dextrose, but, deribose and those kind of things. Then I have the workout, which is around maybe hour eighteen until twenty, something like that. I wait a few hours after the workout as well, maybe an hour or two, and then I break my fast with the one meal a day and that's maybe like 2,000 calories or something and the first protein shake is like 150, 200 calories at max. Then I break the fast, I eat these higher protein foods, eggs, meats, fish, plus some veggies, carbs like potatoes or rice, and berries and fruit. And, this will provide the majority of my calories as well as the majority of my protein, but this smaller surge of protein is still very important, for governing muscle anabolism and muscle repair at the same time. As you can see, like, I'm not eating a massive amount of calories. Like, 2,000 calories, 2,200 calories, is pretty average. It's, kind of, regular. It's not the high metabolic rate. It's not the low metabolic rate. And I would imagine that if I had to eat, like, 3,000 calories with one meal a day, then it would be for sure quite difficult. But 2,000 calories is still quite manageable, or it's not yet maybe 1,800 in in some cases. And it's still quite manageable because the meats and eggs and fish, they're still higher in calories than, like, celery or broccoli and things like that. If I had to eat, like, a plant based diet, maybe it would be much more difficult because of, having this massive amount of fiber and the low calorie volume foods, in my stomach sitting. How much protein do I eat? I personally think that I haven't, like, accurately measured it, but I think that I eat eat around at least two grams per per kilogram. So I weigh eighty four kilograms and that means I eat a 100 and a 168 grams at least and upward to 2.4. So that would be maybe a 118 or 190 grams of protein, something like that. The minimum recommended intake for maximum muscle growth is about 1.6 grams per kilogram. And the higher intakes above 2.4 grams up to three point zero grams per kilogram, they don't contribute additional muscle growth. You don't need to eat more protein than 2.4 grams to build more muscle, but the research does find that the fat gain is a bit less if you do have this crazy higher intake of protein because the protein is very thermogenic and you burn a lot of calories for digesting that protein. So on some days I may even go, yeah, 2.8 grams, three point zero grams, but not on a regular basis. Most of the time I'm still like two point zero, 2.4 grams per kilogram. From the percentage perspective, I think that our protein intake is somewhere between 30 to 40% protein. So it is a very high protein intake because of, you know, although your body doesn't stimulate protein synthesis above this 20 to 40 gram threshold, you can still absorb the rest of the protein, you know, your body is not gonna waste it away. There are ways to slow down the intake of that protein. You absorb it slower, and because of that, you can stay in this anabolic state actually for longer because you're gonna release those amino acids into a bloodstream even later down the line when you're fasting. So eating a low protein diet is very bad if you're doing this one minute diet or any kind of fasting because you need those amino acids to, prevent muscle loss and sarcopenia. And because you are eating only once or twice a day, then, you need to make sure that you do provide enough of this amino acids and protein to, build muscle and maintain it. I love protein. What are the mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy? So there are three main, contributors. Mechanical tension is basically progressive overload and the amount of force your body produces when you are doing resistance training. So this is by far the most biggest factor. It, stimulates the most hypertrophy and, is the one that you should focus on the most, so just increasing the number of weight that you lift. Metabolic stress is essentially the burn feeling causing like micro trauma and the pump, the burn, that kind of thing. It does contribute to muscle hypertrophy, but it's not nearly as important as mechanical tension. Bodybuilders and if you are solely focused on hypertrophy, then you should focus a bit more on mellow excess for sure, but you shouldn't neglect mechanical tension because the majority of results are gonna come from that. And lastly is muscle damage, which describes things like eccentrics, increased range of motion, and novelty. So if your body is doing something new then it's gonna it's not used to that yet and it will also experience more damage from that. So, yeah, it's a good idea to do you know, pay attention to all these factors but the main focus should also be mechanical tension and progressive overload. Training frequency, I really like a high frequency training. I've been doing this high frequency, like, training at least four times a week for, yeah, again five to seven years now, mainly because I like it. I like to train, but also, having this higher frequency of training may be a bit better for muscle growth as well because if you, let's say, train only twice a week, then you train legs twice a week, you bump up muscle protein synthesis in the legs in Monday, then it stays elevated for approximately like forty eight hours or something and then by Wednesday it's gone. It's not building any more muscle because the stimulus has worn off So and you train it again, bam, you repeat that cycle and it wars off for a few days later as well. Compared to training a muscle four times a week, you train legs, boom, the protein synthesis goes up, it goes down, but you boom, you hit it again, boom boom boom. So, that's that's how a high frequency training can end up building more muscle or not maybe more muscle but at least, like, you can build it a bit faster because you're keeping the signal for muscle protein synthesis in that muscle group alive the entire week if you train every other day, for example. One of the best exercises, well the compound lifts generally provide the biggest stimulus because they tax the entire body or more muscle groups, you can overload them more easily, you can add more weight, thus increase progressive overload and mechanical tension. And they also tend to release the most, you know, testosterone and growth hormone and those kinds of things because of the same reason you are using more muscle groups. And all the compound lifts, the the basics, squats, deadlift pull up, bench press, overhead press, tips. Yeah. I've been doing those exercises for, yeah, eight to ten years regularly and these are the best exercises. Instead of doing like, you know, let's say walking lunges or donkey kicks or biceps curls, yeah. For sure. It's a good idea to have some accessories, but the main focus should still be on the combo lifts and the progressive overloads in those. Yeah, buddy. And that's it. That's exactly what I do. I eat one meal a day. I fast maybe, around twenty hours. I break my fast with a protein shake. I have a workout, usually resistance training with weights or calisthenics. It's a kind of a compoundless workout focusing on strength and hypertrophy. Then after the workout, I wait maybe an hour or two. I break my fast completely with, you know, real food and I eat a high protein intake with eggs, meats, some carbs, potatoes, those kind of things. And later after that, you know, I'll have a good night's sleep as well, optimize my recovery. And that's how I do it. Yeah. So generally, it's not, yeah, like one meal a day, but it's like one and a half meals if you want to be, you know, picky about it. So but it's essentially still the 150 calories from the protein shake isn't a significant amount of calories to, break the fast completely. And, even if it did, I would still do this version that I am doing because of, like, the convenience. It's very simple. I like it. I see results from it. And, yeah, I don't plan on stopping, at least for not for the time being. If you want to know how I do it, if you want to know all the details about this targeted intermittent fasting and what foods to eat, then check out my book metabolic cathodeg, or I also have the metabolic cathodeg video course that, has thirteen hours of video content about all these kinds of processes.
