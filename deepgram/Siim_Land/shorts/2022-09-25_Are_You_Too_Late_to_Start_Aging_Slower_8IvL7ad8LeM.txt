Aging doesn't happen immediately. You're not gonna age once you hit 40 immediately. Like, how well you've aged at your forties has been determined by your lifestyle in your twenties and thirties already. So, you need to be taking care of these things already when you're young so that, those things would pay in dividends later in your life.
