Why you should eat more cocoa and not chocolate? Everyone knows that eating too much chocolate will make you fat. But what most people don't know is that eating cocoa actually has a lot of health benefits. Here are three surprising benefits of cocoa. Number one, it's anti inflammatory. Cocoa beans contain a lot of flavonols that support your body's inflammatory response and they have anti inflammatory effects. Number two, reduces stress. The small dopamine boost that you get from cocoa can actually counteract some mental stress and make you feel good. Number three, glucose metabolism. Flavonols have also been found to benefit the risk factors of heart disease, but you don't get flavonols from regular chocolate, only like very dark chocolate and raw cacao. You can still satisfy your chocolate cravings without jeopardizing your health. Just choose the darker chocolate option or consume raw cacao powder.
