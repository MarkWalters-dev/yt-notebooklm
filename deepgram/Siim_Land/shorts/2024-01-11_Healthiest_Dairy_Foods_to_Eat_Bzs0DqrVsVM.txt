Dairy has a bad reputation for causing cancer and increasing heart disease. However, dairy intake, especially fermented dairy, is actually associated with either a neutral or a slightly positive effect on cardiovascular disease outcomes. Here's a list of the healthiest dairy foods you can eat. Number one, blue cheese. It's a fermented cheese that's high in vitamin k two. Dietary vitamin k two intake is found to be associated with less atherosclerosis. Number two, whole milk. A 2021 multi ethnic study of atherosclerosis found an inverse association between self reported whole milk consumption and coronary artery calcification progression. Number three, yogurt and kefir. Yogurt, kefir, and other fermented dairy products appear to have the best outcomes for being associated with reduced heart disease risk. They also contain beneficial probiotics that improve gut health. Number four, cottage cheese. Cottage cheese is very high in protein and thus helps with fat loss and muscle growth. Studies find that higher dairy protein intake is inversely associated with low muscle mass and abdominal obesity. Follow for more.
