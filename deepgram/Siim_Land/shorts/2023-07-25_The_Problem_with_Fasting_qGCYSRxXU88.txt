Fasting could be ruining your health. Here's why. People think that the key to fasting is not eating, but it's actually the reverse. The key to fasting is actually what you eat when you're not fasting. If you don't get this right, then you might lose a lot of muscle. Especially if you fast for too long or you do it too frequently, like three to five days in a row. That's a lot. Even if you're doing the regular sixteen and eight hour method of intermittent fasting, you still need to eat a lot of protein. If you don't pay attention to your protein intake, then chances are you're undereating the protein. Another issue is skipping breakfast and lunch and then eating a massive dinner immediately before bed. This is going to disrupt your body's circadian clocks and reduce the sleep quality. So between you and me.
