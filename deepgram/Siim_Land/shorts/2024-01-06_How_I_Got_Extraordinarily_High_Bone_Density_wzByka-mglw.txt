I measured my bone density, and it showed that my spine has extraordinarily high bone density. It's above the detectable reference range. Having low bone density is a predictor of death from all causes and heart disease. Here are the things I do to keep my bone density so high. Number one, resist straining with weights. This is the most powerful way to increase bone density. Lifting weights triggers the growth of bone by loading the muscles. This can be achieved with everyday activities because the lows aren't big enough. Number two, eat enough calcium. Your bones are literally made of calcium and other minerals. Lifelong calcium intake is associated with higher bone density. Three, keep your vitamin d levels normal. Vitamin d is a hormone that directs calcium into the bones with vitamin k two. And number four, eat enough protein. Low protein intake is associated with poor bone density. In older people, high protein intake is deemed to be optimal for reducing frailty and risk of fractures.
