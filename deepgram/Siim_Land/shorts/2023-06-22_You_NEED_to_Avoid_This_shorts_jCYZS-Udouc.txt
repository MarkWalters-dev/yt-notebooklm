From a perspective of longevity, then diabetes and heart disease are definitely something that you don't want to get and you want to reduce the risk of those conditions as much as possible. But the prolonged hyperglycemia can also have a direct negative effect on the aesthetic side of antiaging. Chronically elevated blood sugar levels do contribute to the development of wrinkles by degrading the collagen in the skin.
