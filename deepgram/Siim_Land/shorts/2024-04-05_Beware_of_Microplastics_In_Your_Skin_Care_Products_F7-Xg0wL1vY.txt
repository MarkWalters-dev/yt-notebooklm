Microplastics are microscopic particles that accumulate in your body. They've been seen to cause hormonal issues and most recently accumulate in the arteries. Microplastics are very common in personal care products such as face creams, moisturizers, cleansers, and face masks. A 2022 report found that only 13% of popular skin care products are plastic free. These are the products that the vast majority of people have heard of and use every day. There's no need to have microplastics in your skin care. That's why the brand I use, Alatora Naturals, uses only 100% natural food grade ingredients. The Alatora Gold Serum is amazing with olive oil, plant retinol, copper peptide, Azteaxanthin, marine collagen, co q 10, and other ingredients that support collagen synthesis in the skin. I personally noticed that my skin glows a lot more and it's better texture. All alitura products are bottled in miron glass, free from microplastics and other hormone disruptors.
