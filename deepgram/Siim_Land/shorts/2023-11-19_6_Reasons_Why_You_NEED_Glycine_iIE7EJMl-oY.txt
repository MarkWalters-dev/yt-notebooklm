Here are six reasons why you need glycine today. Number one, it promotes glutathione. Glulathione is the body's master antioxidant that supports detoxification and the immune system. Number two, it helps with sleep. Glycine increases GABA which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that helps with relaxation, preparing your body for sleep. Number three, it protects the heart. With a healthy amount of glycine in your diet, it will reduce inflammation and protect the heart against oxidative stress. Number four, it lowers blood sugar. When you take glycine before a meal then it helps to lower the blood sugar response by up to 30%. Number five, it balances the methionine in your body. Methionine might have some negative effects on your longevity by increasing homocysteine but glycine counteracts that. Number six, it supports collagen. 25 to 35% of your body's protein is collagen and collagen is 30% glycine. Start incorporating foods like gelatin, nuts, fish with the skin, chicken with the skin and bones into your diet. Keep those benefits in mind and add glycine into your diet.
