With one look in your mouth, you can see tooth decay, bleeding gums, parentitis. What you don't see and what the dentist never focuses on is the next step is, has there been any dental repair done? So have you had metals in your mouth? It's always a question that I ask on every single keynote presentation that I give because I love how the audience reacts. So for example, at the Health Optimization Summit of our friend Tim in London, I asked the audience, please stand up if you have or had metals in your mouth. And the second one is, have you had a root canal treatment? And the third one is always, did they take out your wisdom teeth? And usually, ninety percent of all people, doctors included, they stand up, which shows me they do everything what they should do, like health optimization, diet, nutrition, lifestyle, everything they can do, they they should, but they're still not superhuman. So a doctor doesn't know how to look there, and a dentist doesn't know that this affects the whole body.
