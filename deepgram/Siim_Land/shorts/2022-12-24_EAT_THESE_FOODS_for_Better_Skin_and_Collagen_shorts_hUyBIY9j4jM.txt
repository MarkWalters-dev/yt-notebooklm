What foods, let's say, have high amounts of glycine and collagen? So to be clear too, I don't think that even consuming these foods is gonna give you an optimal intake of glycine because just from the evolutionary perspective, there's too much of a deficit of glycine for an optimal collagen turnover to be offset even by consuming collagenous foods. Because again, getting 10 grams of collagen from skin is still only going to get you maybe two to three grams of glycine. But with that being said, you can make quality or consume quality collagenous bone broths if it actually contains a lot of gelatin. And you'll know that once you put it in the fridge overnight, you'll see most of it will solidify as gelatin if it has a lot of collagen slash gelatin in it.
