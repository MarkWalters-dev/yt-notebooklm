Do you use glycerin powder? Can I add it to foods? Yes. I use glycerin powder. It's great. I use maybe about ten grams a day and I add it to coffee. Sometimes I just take it with a spoon and you can add it to like cottage cheese. It has like a small sweet taste which is quite nice and it doesn't have any harmful effects.
