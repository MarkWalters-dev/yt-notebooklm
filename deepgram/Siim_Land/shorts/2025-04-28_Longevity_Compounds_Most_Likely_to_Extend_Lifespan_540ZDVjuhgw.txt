Other than rapamycin, which compound is most likely to extend lifespan? I'm pretty bullish on SGLT two inhibitors. So these are things like canagliflozin and pagliflozin. They have come out of the mouse intervention testing program as increasing lifespan in mice. There's human correlative data from UK Biobank that people taking these drugs have a lower risk of all cause mortality compared to health matched people who are not taking those drugs. They're anti diabetes drugs. My understanding is they work by causing you to pee out more glucose. Mhmm. I think, estrogens and estradiols are really interesting. They also coming out of the interventions testing program in mice as increasing lifespan in males. And, again, UK Biobank data seem to be associated with lower all cause mortality in females. That would probably mostly be in the context of hormone replacement therapy in women, because not a lot of men have been put on estrogens or estradioles. I'm not suggesting that women who are not perimenopausal or menopausal go out and start taking hormone replacement therapy. I don't think we're there yet, but it's the biology is intriguing. The thing is with the the estrogens and estradiols, we don't understand the mechanism yet, so it's hard to know. I'm certainly not suggesting men run out and start taking these things, but I'm I'm interested to see. And certainly, I would put again, I don't know about lifespan, but I would put hormone therapy particularly in women. Although I also think in many men as a major health span booster. We don't have longevity data yet, but but in terms of impact on health span outside of lifestyle Right. I would probably say hormone therapy is the maybe the next biggest thing that a lot of people can benefit from.
