Is drinking some alcohol healthier than not drinking alcohol at all? Moderate alcohol consumption has been seen to have some longevity benefits, even more so than zero alcohol consumption. Those who never drink have been seen to have a nine percent higher risk of death compared to one to three drinks per week. Does that mean that you have to start drinking to live longer? Not so fast. Those results are often confounded by health problems, healthy user bias, or socioeconomic status. People who don't drink any alcohol might do so because of some health issues. Some analysis that control for these factors find that regular alcohol isn't linked to lower mortality. So, no, moderate alcohol consumption isn't necessarily healthier than zero alcohol consumption, granted you're not abstaining from alcohol because of some health problems. The 2018 analysis of 05/1992 perspective and retrospective studies found that the risk of all cause mortality in cancers rises with increasing levels of consumption, and the level of consumption at minimizes health loss is zero. So maybe one to two drinks per week is fine and not significant, but it's still not better than zero. Follow for more.
