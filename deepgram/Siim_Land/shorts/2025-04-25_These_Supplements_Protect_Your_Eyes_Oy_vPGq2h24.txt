Carotenoids are a type of pigments found in orange, pink, red, and purple foods. They can protect your eyes against screen time and age related decline in eye health. The reason is because carotenoids protect against oxidative stress and glycation in the eyes as well as the brain, which makes them protective for neurodegeneration as well. A 2021 meta analysis of 46 studies saw that supplementing lutein and zeaxanthin at five to twenty milligrams a day improved macular pigment optical density, which is a marker of eye health in people with healthy eyes. Doses below five milligrams were found to be ineffective. That's quite compelling. That lutein and zeeoxantin supplementation has protective effects on the eyes. You certainly want to eat foods that have lutein and zeeoxantin like blueberries, leafy greens, squash, sweet potatoes, carrots, and broccoli. However, you can also benefit your skin from another carotenoid called astaxanthin. Azaxanthin, you get from salmon, shrimp, and other pink red foods. Supplementing astaxanthin has been seen to reverse photo aged skin and protect the skin against UV radiation. So carotenoids from foods and supplements have benefits on your eyes, your brain, and your skin. Follow for more.
