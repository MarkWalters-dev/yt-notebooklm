You should be careful with taking ice baths. Ice baths have many health benefits but they can also have negative side effects if done improperly. If you exercise regularly then ice baths can help you to reduce inflammation and joint pain. But it's important to time it correctly. Taking an ice bath immediately after lifting weights can suppress the muscle growth signal. Now, a short cold shower doesn't have any of those negative side effects but when it comes to actual ice baths then you want to wait at least six to eight hours after doing resistance training. If you do cold exposure before training then that can actually increase your performance. But you should be careful doing it after your workout if you lift the weights. Taking an ice bath after doing cardio endurance is fine and actually beneficial because you lower the inflammation and joint pain, but doing that after lifting weights will be bad for the muscle growth. So if your goal is increasing muscle growth or strength then you might want to avoid the cold exposure after working out.
