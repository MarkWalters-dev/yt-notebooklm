Strength is important for just everyday activities, gardening, putting on clothes, going to the toilet, eating, rising up from a chair. If you have low muscle strength, then you're expected to have a hard time doing those everyday activities once you get older. If you have the lowest quartile of muscle strength, then that's two to three times greater risk of experiencing difficulty putting on clothes compared to the highest strength. And even going to the toilet, toileting is also around three times more likely to experience difficulties if you have the lowest strength compared to the highest strength. Eating, again, three times more likely to experience difficulties. Eating in the group of lowest strength just being able to get up from the chair that risk is three to four times higher if you have lowest muscle strength.
