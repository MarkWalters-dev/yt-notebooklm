There's no other factor to my knowledge that has as profound and far reaching influence on any clock. So that just strikes me, it seems illustrative of the potential power of stress, of excess glucocorticoid release to really drive aging. And we can see it in the literature, the pro aging effect of chronic stress, total life stress, etcetera. Also the association with chronic diseases of aging as well. And conversely, we see the benefits of meditation, of activities that turn the volume down on stress, the benefits of exercise, tai chi, of yoga, etcetera. Yeah. Yeah. That's true.
