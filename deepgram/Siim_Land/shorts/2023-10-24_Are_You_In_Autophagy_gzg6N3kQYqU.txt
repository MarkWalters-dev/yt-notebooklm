Are you in autophagy? Many people self diagnose themselves being in autophagy, but figuring out if your body is in autophagy isn't that simple. First of all, autophagy isn't like an on and off switch. Your body is in some state of autophagy all the time. But measuring autophagy in humans is currently not really possible, so you shouldn't really focus on trying to humans is currently not really possible. So you shouldn't really focus on trying to pursue autophagy because chances are it's going to happen at some point. Instead, what I recommend is you focus on the things that increase autophagy, such as exercise, dietary phytonutrients, not snacking, polyphenols and saunas. If you exercise for even as little as thirty to sixty minutes, your body's autophagy levels will increase. You can also regulate autophagy by drinking tea and coffee. I understand that everyone wants to know about the health status, but you don't have to be that concerned about it, especially when it comes to things like autophagy. Just make sure you're in great shape and your biomarkers are good. Everything else will follow.
