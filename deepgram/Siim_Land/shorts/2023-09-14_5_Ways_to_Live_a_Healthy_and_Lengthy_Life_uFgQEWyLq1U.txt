Everyone wants to live longer, but do your habits reflect that? Here's five steps you must take to live a longer and healthier life. Number one, don't smoke. Smoking is one of the biggest risk factors for early death. Exposing your lungs to difficult chemicals and smoke causes a lot of oxidative stress and DNA damage throughout your body. Number two, maintain a normal body weight. Being obese and overweight can cause a lot of health issues such as diabetes and heart disease. Number three, exercise regularly. Keeping your body active is quite crucial for slowing down aging and making sure you don't become frail later in life. Number four, eat in a way that keeps your blood work clear. Maintaining a good body weight is important, but it doesn't always reflect your inner health. Looking at your blood work is one of the most powerful things for preventing diseases and you achieve that with a balanced whole foods diet. And lastly, number five, limit alcohol. Just like smoking, drinking a lot can lead to many health issues. So stay consistent with your daily habits and see your longevity improve.
