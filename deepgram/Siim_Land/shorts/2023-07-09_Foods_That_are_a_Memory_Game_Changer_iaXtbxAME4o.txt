Here are three foods that will drastically improve your memory. Number one. Omega three fatty acids. This is one of the most important nutrients for the brain. You can get omega threes mostly from seafood like fish, oysters, clams and other kinds of seafood. Number two is choline. It's another essential nutrient and one of the biggest determinants whether or not you get neurodegeneration later in life. Your brain and nervous system need choline to regulate memory, muscle function and other processes. Some good sources of choline are mackerel, sardines, eggs and liver. Lastly, you also want to protect your brain from oxidative stress and inflammation. This brings me to number three, polyphenols, plant compounds that protect the plant against oxidative stress. They can also boost antioxidant defense systems and lower inflammation. You can get polyphenols from olive oil, olives, different kinds of vegetables, herbs, berries and some dark pigmented fruits. Are you getting all of these three essential nutrients for your memory and brain? Let me know in the comments.
