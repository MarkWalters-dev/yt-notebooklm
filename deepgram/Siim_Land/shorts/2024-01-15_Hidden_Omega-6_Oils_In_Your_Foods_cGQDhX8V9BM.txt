Processed foods have a lot of added sugar, but they also have added oils. These oils can offset your omega three to six ratio, which promotes inflammation and oxidative stress. Here are the top foods with added omega sixes that you want to avoid. Number one, sauces like regular tomato sauce, salad dressing, or mayonnaise. Number two, processed meats, especially the sausages, bacon, and hotdogs. Grain fed meat also tends to have a much higher omega six ratio. Number three, deep fried foods like French fries, chips, donuts, fish sticks, etcetera. They're all fried in omega six oils. Number four, canned fish like sardines and herring. It's commonly packed in canola oil. There are some brands that are in olive oil, which is healthier, but even then you want to limit canned fish consumption because they're higher in heavy metals and eczemaestrogens. And number five, TV dinners and premade meals. They're almost always prepared with omega six oils. Remember, your body needs a balance of four to one or one to one of omega sixes to omega threes.
