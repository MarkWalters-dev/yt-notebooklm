There are dangers all around your home that no one is talking about. For instance non stick pans. They seem relatively convenient and easy to use but they also have a dark side. Non stick pans are covered with a synthetic material called Teflon that can interrupt with your hormone production and cause problems with your thyroid and the brain. Plastic kettles are another problem because they can leach microplastics into your water. High temperatures and heat mobilize the microplastics in the material into the water and if you consume it then those microplastics will be stored inside your body where they can disrupt your hormones and cause other problems. Instead of non stick pans, use cast iron or stainless steel cookware. They're much more durable and they don't have any synthetic substances in them. And instead of plastic kettles, use either glass or metal kettles. They're more resistant to the heat and they don't contaminate your water.
