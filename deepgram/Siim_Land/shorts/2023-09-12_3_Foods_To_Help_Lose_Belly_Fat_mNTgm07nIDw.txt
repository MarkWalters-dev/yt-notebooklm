Some people work out all the time, but they can't seem to lose their belly fat. What they don't realize is that abs are made in the kitchen, not in the gym. Here are three foods you can add into your diet to lose belly fat. Fat. Number one, green tea. Green tea contains catechins that target specifically belly fat and help you to slim down faster. Number two is grapefruit. A study done in food and nutrition in 2014 found that consuming grapefruit helps you to reduce your waist size thanks to containing a compound called Inositol. Inositol improves your insulin sensitivity and grapefruit also contains vitamin c that makes fat burning easier. Number three is beans and lentils. Beans and lentils have a ton of soluble fiber. This helps you to stay full for a lot longer time. As a result, you end up snacking less and eating less calories in general. Just because you add these foods to your diet doesn't mean that you could eat McDonald's or your grandma's cake every day. Losing that stubborn belly fat requires a balance between a good diet and exercise.
