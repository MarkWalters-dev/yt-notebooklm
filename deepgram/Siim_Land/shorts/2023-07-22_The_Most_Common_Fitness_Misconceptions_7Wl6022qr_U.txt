Everyone is making the same weight loss mistakes over and over again. A big mistake. One of the biggest misconceptions about exercise is that it's only for weight loss or vanity in improving your body composition. Yes. Exercise does help you to lose weight and you will have a better looking body, but exercise is also one of the most powerful things you can do for longevity and anti aging. Higher VO2 max, which is a reflection of your cardiorespiratory fitness, is one of the greatest predictors of longevity. The higher your vo two max is, the lower your risk of mortality. And the same applies to muscle strength and muscle mass. Muscle and strength are associated with reduced mortality, but you definitely don't want to take it to the level of bodybuilders. You just need to have a good amount of lean tissue and be strong enough. Overall, fitness makes your body healthier and more resilient on an epigenetic level that you can't really achieve with any pill or a diet. So if there were to be only one thing that makes you live longer and healthier, then it would be regular exercise.
