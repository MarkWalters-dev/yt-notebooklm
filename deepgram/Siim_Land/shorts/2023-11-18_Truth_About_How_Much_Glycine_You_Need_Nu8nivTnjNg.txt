Why taking collagen isn't enough? To support collagen production, you also need glycine. Collagen turnover requires twelve grams of glycine per day. Collagen is made of 30% glycine, so if you take ten grams of collagen, you're gonna get only three grams of glycine from that. Your body does make three grams of glycine every day itself. Even if you're eating glycine rich foods or taking a collagen supplement, you're gonna get only three to six grams of glycine per day. If you add it all up, then you're still missing around three to five grams of glycine for optimal collagen turnover. So if you're not taking collagen or glycine as a supplement then you might not reach the optimal intake of fifteen grams of glycine per day. The collagen I'm taking is North Code Complete Collagen. Besides the ten grams of collagen peptides it also has extra five grams of glycine. So I'm getting a total of eight grams of glycine per serving, which is amazing.
