A man is only as old as his arteries. There are many foods and lifestyle habits that damage your arteries and promote heart disease. However, there are some supplements that also damage your arteries. Number one, iron. High ferritin and iron levels are known to be associated with carotid atherosclerosis. The reason is that excess iron becomes easily oxidized, which then damages the blood vessels. Excess iron also aggravates atherosclerosis, and iron restriction improves it. However, iron deficiency is also associated with heart disease, probably due to malnutrition. So you have to be careful with supplementing iron, and probably dietary iron is not that important. Number two, calcium. Calcium supplementation is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The reason has to do with high amounts of calcium causing hypercalcemia, which promotes blood coagulation, vascular calcification, and arterial stiffness. Dietary calcium, again, appears to be safe. It's actually associated with reduced risk of atherosclerosis. But taking extra calcium as supplements might be more risky to follow for more.
