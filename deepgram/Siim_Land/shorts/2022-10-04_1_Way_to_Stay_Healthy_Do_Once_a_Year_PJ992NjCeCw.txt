That the annual blood work is, yeah, the most effective and probably the best ways to keep track of your overall health, on a regular basis. I don't think that you need to do a blood work every few months or so. Once a year is already pretty good, and, you don't need even more than that. If you're already everything is pretty good and healthy and doing, like, an annual blood work, kind of, like, an assurance or insurance policy in terms of keeping track of your health.
