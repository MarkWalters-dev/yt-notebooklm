Stop making these mistakes after eating. Do you struggle with bloating and digestive issues? This might be the reason why. Changing only a couple of things after you eat can make a huge difference. After you eat, you should avoid sitting on the couch or going to sleep. Instead, you should take a short walk. That's because there's going to be a normal rise in your blood sugar after eating. Now that is perfectly normal but going for a short walk can help you to lower that blood sugar much faster. But you don't wanna go for intense exercise because this can also inhibit digestion. Imagine a person who suffers from digestive issues several times per week. With just a daily ten minute walk, you can get rid of that forever.
