Here are the five key supplements I recommend that have been vital for my personal health and well-being. Number one, collagen. It's a structural protein that makes up 30% of your entire body's protein. Collagen makes up your joints, tendons, ligaments, hair, nail, and skin. Collagen is basically the glue that holds you together. Number two is glycine. It's an amino acid that has many benefits such as it improves glutathione synthesis, collagen synthesis, creatine synthesis and it lowers your blood sugar levels. You need at least fifteen grams of glycine per day to make enough collagen for the skin. Number three, creatine. It's a molecule that helps your muscles to produce energy and power. Studies have found that creatine helps with muscle growth, muscle strength and muscle power. Number four, NAC stands for n acetylcysteine. NAC together with glycine is a precursor to gluethrone and it can raise your gluethrone levels. Number five, TMG or trimethylglycine is a methyl donor that supports body's methylation. Methylation is a process that regulates gene expression and longevity pathways.
