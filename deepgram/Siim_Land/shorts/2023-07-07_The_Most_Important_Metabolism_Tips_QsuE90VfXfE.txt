You don't necessarily need to go to the gym to be healthy. Do this instead. A good way to burn more calories and stay healthy is to walk every day. Sounds simple but surprisingly a lot of people struggle with this. But if you just increase the chance of you automatically walking every day then you have already won. You could park the car further away, get a treadmill desk, walk the stairs instead of taking an elevator, take movement breaks every hour or just get a dog. Make it easier for yourself to walk. This is going to increase your non exercise physical activity, cleaning the house, taking the stairs and just fidgeting around. Most of the calories you burn every day comes from this non exercise physical activity that you do every day. Lifting weights actually burns very little calories compared to the amount of effort you put in, but does increase your muscle mass, which increases your resting energy expenditure. So lifting weights to build muscle is beneficial for weight loss and body composition, but make sure that you also incorporate non exercise physical activity into your day.
