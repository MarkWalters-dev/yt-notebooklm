Best way to gain muscle without fat. See progressive overload in your training. You want to be in a small calorie surplus and you don't want to overspill with your calories and carbohydrates. Try to aim for the one gram of protein per body weight. Do a good resistance training program that, emphasizes progressive overload where you get stronger over time. I like to stick to only, like, a 500 calorie surplus. You don't need necessarily more than that smaller surplus. Being more patient with it, yeah, it's gonna take a longer time. But if you want to minimize fat gain, then that's what you need to do.
