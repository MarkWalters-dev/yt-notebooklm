Here's what drinking coffee will do to your health. What if I told you you can drink coffee without worrying about the health problems many people are talking about? Many people say that coffee is bad but they never tell you the full story. Drinking two to three cups of coffee a day is linked to lower risk of mortality and less heart disease. And this applies to all kinds of coffee. We go to ground coffee, decaf coffee, and even instant coffee. The reason is that coffee contains a lot of antioxidants and polyphenol. But why do so many people say that coffee is bad for your health? Coffee itself is a healthy drink but if you load it up with sugar and a lot of cream, then of course it can become unhealthy and it can make you gain weight. There is also a genetic difference between those who are fast metabolizers of caffeine and those who are slow metabolizers. If you are a slow metabolizer, then you will experience more of the negative side effects, such as poor sleep and anxiety. In that case, you should consume less caffeine or choose more decaf options. But if you're a fast metabolizer of caffeine, then you can consume more caffeine with less side effects.
