So many people go to the gym as well and they're not really getting stronger over time. They're doing the same weights and same, reps, etcetera. But when you look at, you know, what drives muscle hypertrophy, what is important for that, and the main mechanism for that is progressive overload. One of the main mechanisms, which can be defined in many ways, but it's essentially just getting stronger over time. If you do want to build muscle and strength and get bigger, whatever, then you need to see progressive overload and, get stronger over time. Strength is the main, like, reflection of progressive overload. And mechanical tension is the mediator or, like, the driver of progressive overload, which describes just lifting heavy things and causing mechanical tension to your muscles in whatever shape or form.
