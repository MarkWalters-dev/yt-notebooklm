Stop giving your kids melatonin. Let me explain. I know kids can be hard to deal with sometimes and often they might not want to fall asleep. Giving them melatonin gummies or just melatonin might work. They fall asleep easier. However, melatonin in children and teenagers can have some negative effects on their hormones. Melatonin supplementation has been found to postpone puberty in children. That means they develop puberty later and they may not go through normal puberty. So that's why you shouldn't give children or teenagers any melatonin. Instead of giving them supplemental melatonin, help their bodies produce melatonin naturally by blocking out blue light with blue blocking glasses and reducing screen time during the daytime, which has been found to make it much harder to fall asleep at night.
