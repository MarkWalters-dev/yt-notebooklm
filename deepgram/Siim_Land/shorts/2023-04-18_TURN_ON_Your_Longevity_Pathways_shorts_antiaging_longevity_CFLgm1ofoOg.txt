Tenant number three. So cellular pathways, how about those? So the big three pathways, we talked a bit about the sirtuins. Obviously, there are seven. I am obsessed with one, three, and six. The AMP kinase pathway, we talked about a little bit. That's your major metabolic switch. It measures how much energy you have in your system. So actually it measures the inverse. It measures how much energy you don't have in your system because AMP is adenosine monophosphate, which means it doesn't have energy at all. So it measures how much energy you don't have, and it puts your body in a state of hibernation, which is why it helps with longevity, and it looks your body for ways to either increase energy or decrease the requirement for energy. So it turns off a lot of energy requiring processes, like in cholesterol, making proteins, that sort of thing. That's how it puts you in a state of hibernation that's associated with longevity. Unfortunately, of course, the enzyme fails over time as you get older. So with disease and diabetes and that sort of thing.
