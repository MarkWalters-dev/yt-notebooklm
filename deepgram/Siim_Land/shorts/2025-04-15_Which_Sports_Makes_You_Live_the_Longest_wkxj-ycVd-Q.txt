People often say that athletes are fit but they don't live longer. That's not true. Studies consistently show that athletes live on average five years longer than the general population. But which sport increases life expectancy the most? This 2024 review from a 183 countries on up to 100,000 athletes saw that the top five sports for life expectancy were pole vaulting, gymnastics, fencing, targeting sports, racket sports, mixed track and field, race walking and cricket. The bottom five sports with the shortest life efficiency were sumo wrestling, volleyball, mountaineering, martial arts and handball. Now, there are some obvious caveats. These athletes were overwhelmingly male so we don't have data about females. And there may be some other factors such as socioeconomic status that affects these results. However, sumo wrestlers earn almost twice as much money as gymnasts and pole vaulters but they still live significantly shorter. So there can be some element of truth in this study. You do wanna do sports but you don't wanna become overweight and contact sports might have negative effects on your overall lifespan. Another study from Australia found exactly that Olympic athletes lived over three years longer than the general population with the exception of Australian football players and rocket players because of the contact and trauma.
