There are a lot of foods in America that are banned in Europe and other countries. Number one, bread products with azodicarbonamide and potassium bromate. In The US, companies use these chemicals as a whitening and raising agent in the flour. Azodicarbonamide is banned in Europe because it's a possible carcinogen. Number two, breakfast cereals like Frosted Flakes and Rice Krispies. They're banned in Europe because they contain butylated hydroxytolowine, BHT, which is a flavor enhancer and a preservative. It's also thought to be a carcinogen, which is why it's banned in The EU. Some other cereals like cinnamon toast in Europe have removed their BHT, which is why it tastes different than the cinnamon toast in The US. Number three, Skittles isn't banned in Europe completely, but the European Skittles can't have titanium dioxide. The food dyes yellow five, yellow six, and red 40 are also banned in The EU, whereas they're not in The US. While the evidence about the harm of these ingredients isn't conclusive, titanium dioxide might cause DNA damage and promote cancer. Follow for more.
