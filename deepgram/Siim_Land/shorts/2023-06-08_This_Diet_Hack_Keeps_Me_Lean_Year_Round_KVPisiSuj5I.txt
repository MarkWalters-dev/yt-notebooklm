Hack number two is my favorite because I like sweet potato fries and pancakes, it's called car backloading. So, you know, the common knowledge is that, you need to eat carbs breakfast and maybe lunch and don't eat any carbs after six because you somehow magically store them as fat, which isn't true. I would argue that it's much actually smarter to eat carbs later in the day instead of the morning and the reason for that has to do with the natural circadian rhythm. Yes, we are more insulin sensitive in the earlier parts of the day, but not in the morning immediately after waking up. When you wake up in the morning, you're actually somewhat insulin resistant because of the higher amounts of cortisol your body produces naturally and cortisol, the stress hormone, it increases fat burning, it's good for that, but it also makes you insulin resistant to a certain extent that it makes it easier to store calories as fat. So, it's not a smart idea to eat like Cheerios or croissants for for breakfast because you are more prone to store them as fat.
