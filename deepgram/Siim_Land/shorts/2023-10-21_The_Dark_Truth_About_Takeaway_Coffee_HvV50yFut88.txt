Everyone loves a cup of coffee, but you might want to rethink using a takeaway cup lid. Takeaway coffee cup lids are made of plastic. When you place it over a hot cup, the heat is going to mobilize the microplastics inside the lid into your coffee. Microplastics contain xenoestrogens and other chemicals that can be harmful for your fertility, your hormones, and overall health. You should be cautious with the paper cups inside offices and your homes. The lining that makes these cups waterproof also contains the same chemicals found in microplastics. If you drink coffee or tea that has microplastics inside them, you could be ingesting up to 75,000 particles of micro of cup itself is fine but don't add the lid on top. Or the best option is to take your own thermocup. You're gonna be more environmentally friendly and you'll avoid the microplastics.
