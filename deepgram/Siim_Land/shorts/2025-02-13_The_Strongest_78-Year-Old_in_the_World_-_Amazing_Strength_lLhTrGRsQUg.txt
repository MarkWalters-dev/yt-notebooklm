78 year old Okura Katsuie broke the world record in the master division with a 141 kilogram back squat. To put it into perspective, that's double the amount of weight a 78 year old would be expected to lift. And it's higher than what a 30 year old would lift based on strength standards in the general population. Muscle mass and strength typically peak in your thirties, after which they start to slowly decline by about 10% per decade. When you reach the age of 78 like Okura, you're expected to be frail and weak, not able to carry heavy luggage, not able to lift your grandchildren, and not able to carry your groceries. Not only is Okura able to do all of those things, he's also able to lift more weight than the average 30 year old. What's his secret? I don't know all the details of his lifestyle, but I'm pretty sure he does resistance training. Resistance training is the only way to stop and reverse the age related muscle loss that our bodies go through. Regular walking or even cardiovascular exercise isn't enough because it's not intense enough. You need to do some form of resistance training. Follow for more.
