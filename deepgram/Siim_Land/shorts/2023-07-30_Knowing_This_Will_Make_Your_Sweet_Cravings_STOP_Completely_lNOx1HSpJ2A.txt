To reduce the amount of sugar you eat, you first need to understand where are your sugar cravings coming from. There's a billion dollar industry that wants you to rely on scams and diets instead of changing just a few habits. First, you need to change some of your habits. Many daily habits can make you crave sugar without even realizing it. For example, not getting enough sleep. Wanting more sugar can also be a sign that you're not getting enough protein and fiber. If you're used to consuming sugar every day, then your taste buds will get used to the sweetness, thus making you crave more of it. Lack of sunlight is another thing that can make you feel less full because it disregulates your hormones. So less exposure to sunlight and bright lights means that you're gonna eat more. But there's another shocking reason why you crave sugar. The blue light in your electronics has been proven to increase sugar cravings. Now imagine trying to stop eating sugar without changing these habits. You would probably get frustrated and quit without knowing that it's not your fault.
