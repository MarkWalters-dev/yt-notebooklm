Why coffee pods are unhealthy. If you prepare your morning coffee using single use pods, then you should make the switch for a healthier alternative. Coffee pods aren't actually that healthy for you. When the pods are heated up, their plastic containers release microplastics into your coffee. These microplastics can accumulate in your body and they can have a negative effect on your hormones. These estrogenic chemicals can mimic estrogen inside your body and throw off your hormones. While this is alarming, there are much healthier alternatives that you can still use to drink coffee. Many retailers actually use stainless steel coffee pods that you can reuse. They're easy to wash and a lot more environmentally friendly than the plastic coffee pods. So ditch the single use coffee pods to keep your hormones in check.
