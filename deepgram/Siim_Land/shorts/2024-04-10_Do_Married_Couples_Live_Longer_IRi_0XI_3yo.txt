Many studies find that being married is linked to better health and reduced risk of all cause mortality. This effect is even more pronounced among men than women. There are many hypothetical reasons for this. A spouse can improve your mental health, they can help you to follow healthier lifestyle habits, and they can just even call an ambulance when you are in an emergency. Of course, you would have to be in a loving and healthy relationship for that to happen, but I do think that it's important to follow healthy lifestyle habits together as a couple. Me and my wife are both into health and fitness, which is why neither of us judges or laughs at each other's weird habits related to food or supplements. Best of all, we incorporate health into our relationship and life together. A few months ago, we went to a longevity clinic in India called Iwo at a five star hotel. There, we spent a week getting many different medical tests and longevity treatments. So I invite you to do the same with your own partner. If you want to join us at our next retreat in Iwo, then message me the word India or send an email to info@seamland.com, and I'll send you the details.
