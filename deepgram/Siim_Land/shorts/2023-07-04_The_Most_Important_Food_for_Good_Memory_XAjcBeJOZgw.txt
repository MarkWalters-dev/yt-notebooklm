Anyone is at risk of losing their memory, not just older people. Here are the three superfoods you should include into your diet if you want to boost your memory. Number one. Eggs are not only a good source of protein but also choline is a new gene that helps your brain produce acetyl codeine. It's a neurotransmitter that is involved in memory and mood. Studies have shown that people who eat eggs have better memory performance and lower rates of depression. Number two, fish is full of omega three fatty acids which are vital for your brain. Omega three's help your brain cells to grow and communicate better. They also protect your brain from oxidative stress and inflammation which rises during aging. Research has found that people who eat fish have higher IQs and better learning performance. Number three, olive oil is one of the healthiest fats you could eat. It contains monounsaturated fats and polyphenols which protect your brain from inflammation and oxidative stress. Olive oil can also lower your blood pressure and lipids which are risk factors for dementia and stroke. Olive oil can also modulate your brain activity and stress hormone which then can improve your memory and mood.
