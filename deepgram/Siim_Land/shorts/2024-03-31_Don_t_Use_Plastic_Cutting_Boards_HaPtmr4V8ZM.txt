There are a lot of sources of microplastics in our environment. Recently, it was shown that having more microplastics in the arteries can increase the incidence of heart disease and death by fourfold compared to no microplastics in the arteries. Plastic cutting boards haven't seemed to be a source of microplastics in food. A 2022 study saw that plastic cutting boards leach microplastics into meat. You basically are cutting into the board with a knife, which detaches the microplastics from the board, and it ends up in the food that you're cutting. The simple fix for that is to use wooden cutting boards. Even then, you have to be careful not to consume a lot of packaged proteins as it's been found that meat products packaged in plastics can leach into the food. This is obviously a hard problem to solve because you need protein to live, and the packaging of plastics actually preserves the protein in the foods for longer. It increases the shelf life. So the only thing that you can really do is minimize your other exposure to microplastics, probably for more.
