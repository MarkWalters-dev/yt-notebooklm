How to easily calculate your biological age? With these three simple tests you can know how old your body actually is. The first option is using a DNA methylation test that measures your DNA methylation age. The issue with that is these tests are very sensitive to stress, inflammation, and infections. So you don't wanna take these tests if you've been sick recently. A more simple method is doing a blood test. It's cheaper, faster, and more accessible. Your blood test results help you to see if they match your age group and how well are you doing compared to other people of your age. The last method is looking at your performance. This includes different fitness parameters like your rear to max, muscle strength, gait speed, and your body composition. If you want to know what's your health and biological age right now, then do the performance test or the blood test. If you want to know a more scientific answer and you can wait for longer, then you can do the DNA methylation test. But don't take it when you're sick.
