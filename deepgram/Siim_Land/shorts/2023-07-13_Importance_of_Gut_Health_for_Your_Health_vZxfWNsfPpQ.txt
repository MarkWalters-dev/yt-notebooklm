Your gut health is the only thing you need to micromanage in your life. Here's why. The gut is connected to many things. It can certainly have a big effect on your mood and how you feel on a daily basis, but it can certainly affect your weight loss and weight gain as well. But I think the biggest thing that your gut impacts is your mood, your immune system and how you feel. So if you have some food sensitivities then they are going to cause a reaction in your body and that happens through the gut. Autoimmune responses and allergic reactions are gonna keep your body under chronic inflammation And if you're always reacting to certain foods then that chronic inflammation will affect your aging and longevity in a bad way. Chances are if you do most things right with your lifestyle and diet then you probably don't have any gut issues. But if you do have specific medical conditions or autoimmune conditions then you need to pay more attention to the foods you eat and your gut health.
