I'm sure most of you have already heard that the FDA banned NMN, especially beta NMN as a dietary supplement in The US. Regardless, I thought I made this video about another potential much cheaper and more widespread supplement that can replace NMN and that you can use for antigen purposes and to raise your NAD levels. So the supplement is niacin. The niacin has a long track record of having health benefits, especially in reducing cardiovascular disease risk and reducing cholesterol levels. And when it comes to NAD metabolism and niacin and any other form of niacin like niacinamide, nicotinamide, or niacin alone has been found to also have a positive effect on NAD levels and raising NAD levels.
