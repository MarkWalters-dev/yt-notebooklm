Exercising either before or after eating within two hours of a meal has shown to lower postprandial glucose and triglycerides by 50%. Instead of sitting on a couch after a meal, you want to go for a short walk to lower the blood sugar response. You can also add different kinds of herbs and spices to your meal like cinnamon, turmeric, ginger and even cayenne pepper. Those can also have a positive effect. So the best scenario is that before you eat, even if it doesn't have carbohydrates, is that you want to move a little bit and then eat the meal with some things that lower the glycemic load such as vinegar, olive oil and some other fiber and protein in the meal. Then after the meal you can go for a walk to lower the blood sugar response.
