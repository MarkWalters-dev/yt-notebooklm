Most people are taking collagen supplements at sort of a suboptimal time. Most people will just dump it in their coffee, which is not to say there's nothing to do with the coffee or the high temperature basically inhibiting the benefits of the collagen. It's the fact that you really wanna take collagen optimally to support collagen synthesis around the time of exercise. Somewhere between an hour before to an hour after would likely be more optimal. Yeah. That's a good tip. And I guess, yeah, like, many people generally haven't considered that that it's actually important to take it around the exercise. At least for the joints, I would imagine. Maybe for the skin benefits, you can take it at any other time. But for the joints, especially, you need it at the exercise time.
