About four months ago, I measured my VO2 max for the first time and I got a score of 53. That's very good and it already puts me in the lowest risk category, but I wanted to take it to the next level. For four months, I switched my training focus to cardio and increasing my VO2 max. The second time I measured my VO two max, I got a score of 66, which is in the elite category. How did I see such a massive improvement in my VO two max such a short time? Number one, I was very sensitive to the training stimulus because I hadn't trained that much cardio before. That's why my body got a lot of results very fast. Number two, I trained zone two cardio for three times a week for forty five to fifty five minutes per session. Zone two cardio is low intensity cardio. That's around 50 to 60% of your maximum heart rate. Basically, it's easy enough that you can maintain nasal breathing. Number three, I also did one high intensity interval training session per week. Four minutes of maximum effort followed by four minutes of zone two repeated for four rounds. This method has been shown in studies to increase VO2 max. The best way to increase your VO2 max is to just do cardio.
