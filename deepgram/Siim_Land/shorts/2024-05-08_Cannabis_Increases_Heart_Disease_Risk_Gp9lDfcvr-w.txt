We all know that smoking cigarettes is bad for your health. However, smoking cannabis is pretty much as bad for you. A recent 2024 study found that among US adults, cannabis use was linked to worse cardiovascular outcomes. Cannabis use whether through smoking, edibles, or vapes were all linked to higher risk. Heavier use the more days per month, the higher the risk of adverse outcomes. Similar risk associations were found among those who never smoked tobacco. It makes sense if you're smoking then you're causing chemical and physical damage to your blood vessels, lungs, and heart which then increase the risk of heart disease. Now there might be some overlap between cannabis smokers and those who also consume cannabis edibles as the ones who consume edibles probably also smoke cannabis which mediates their risk. We would need future trials comparing the effects of exclusively using cannabis edibles and exclusively using cannabis tobacco. But there are certainly other risks involved with using cannabis. Overall smoking whether regular cigarettes or cannabis both increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Follow for more.
