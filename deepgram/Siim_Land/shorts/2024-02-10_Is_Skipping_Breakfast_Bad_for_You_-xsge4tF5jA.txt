Breakfast is said to be the most important meal of the day. However, a lot of people do end up the fasting and they skip breakfast. Is skipping breakfast safe? Epidemiological studies consistently find that skipping breakfast is associated with a higher risk of diabetes or cause in cardiovascular disease mortality. These are observational studies, which means that they're often confounded by the healthy user bias. People who skip breakfast usually follow other unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as they tend to overeat or smoke. A 2019 meta analysis of prospective studies found that skipping breakfast was associated with a higher risk of type two diabetes, but this association was mediated primarily by BMI. If you are physically active and otherwise healthy, then you probably don't have to worry about skipping breakfast increasing your risk of death. You just have to make sure that you're not overeating calories later in the day. Intermittent fasting and skipping breakfast isn't superior to regular calorie restriction, but it can help many people to adhere to a calorie deficit, which is a very useful tool and a net positive.
