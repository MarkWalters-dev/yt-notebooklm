You've heard many times that ice baths are great for recovery. Yes. There is indeed benefits to muscle soreness and inflammation when taking ice baths after exercise. However, there's a new study that showed how taking a hot bath after exercise can result in faster recovery than cold baths. The scientists first let 30 fit men exercise to cause muscle damage and then they were randomized into getting either a cold water immersion at 11 degrees Celsius or hot water immersion at 41 degrees Celsius. After forty eight hours, the hot water immersion improved recovery of maximum force production more so than the cold water immersion. The reason for that is because cold water has a more negative effect on your fast twitch muscle fibers that are responsible for speed and power. Cold water also blunts the muscle growth signal if you take an ice bath immediately after lifting as shown by many other studies. Instead, after lifting, you should do something like a sauna or expose yourself to warm water because that's going to be more beneficial for recovery after doing something intense. Cold water exposure is great after cardio or if you are very sore from working out because of lowering inflammation. But for recovery from force requiring workouts, warm water appears to be better.
