Warning. This regular household product could be damaging your health. The air freshener industry is worth $13,000,000,000 but these companies are making money while putting your health at risk. Air fresheners make the air quality inside your house as bad as outdoor pollution with thousands of different kinds of chemicals and xenoestrogens. Being in a constant environment with these chemicals can lead to respiratory problems and hormonal issues. So what should you replace them with so your home smells nice? It's best to go with natural essential oils or something like an oil diffuser to keep large spaces clean smelling. Air fresheners are a secret danger that almost everyone has in their bathroom, so make sure you throw them out and replace them with something healthier.
