Incidentally is number one. It's still, like, most powerful anabolic hormone in the body that helps to drive protein synthesis and mTOR activation. And insulin also has, like, other roles in terms of thyroid function, leptin sensitivity, brain function, and brain health that we'll cover shortly. So yeah, what the insulin does is it has a hormone it helps to shuttle glucose into the cells. And when it helps with like muscles then it shuttles, like, glucose into the muscle cells that's stored as glycogen and turn on protein synthesis and helps to build the tissue, which is obviously good in, some aspects.
