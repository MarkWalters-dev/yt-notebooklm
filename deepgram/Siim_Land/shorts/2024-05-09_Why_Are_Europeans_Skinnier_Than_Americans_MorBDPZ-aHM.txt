Europeans are a lot skinnier than Americans. In The United States, obesity rates are over forty five percent, but in Europe, they're around twenty to twenty five percent. That's almost half as much obesity in Europe than in America. Why is this so? First, there's a big difference in the commuting culture between America and Europe. In The US, the automobile is the main method of transportation and commuting. Whereas in Europe, people in the big cities use a lot of metros, public transport, and walking. In the city centers of Europe, it's much faster and easier to walk everywhere, which then helps to keep the weight down. Second, the portion sizes in Europe are much smaller than in The US. Europeans end up eating much fewer calories. The food options in Europe tend to be also healthier with people eating less fast food and high calorie meals. Third, the foods are much more regulated in Europe than in The US. You can't find a lot of processed foods in Europe that you can easily get in The US because they're either banned or forced to change their ingredients. Lastly, government policies tend to promote healthier lifestyles and better health care in Europe than in The US. Follow for more.
