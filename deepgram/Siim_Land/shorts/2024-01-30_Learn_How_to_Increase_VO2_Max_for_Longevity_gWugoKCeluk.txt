My name is Siim Lund and I increased my VO2 Max from above average to the elite level within three months. I have joined forces with the Biohacker Center and HoloHabits to invite you to the VO2 Max challenge. With the HoloHabits app you can learn from me how to increase your VO2 Max and track your progress. In the month of February you can join the VO2 Max challenge to increase your car to respiratory fitness. The winner of this challenge gets a free pass to the Biohiker Summit in Helsinki as well as the Optimize Day workshop the day before. Number one, download the Follow Habits app from the Google or Apple Store. Number two, sign up for the challenge. You can find the link to sign up from the Biohacker Summit bio. And number three, share your progress. Every time you follow the routines, make sure you tag follow habits in your stories. The winner will be drawn from all the participants who joined the challenge and those who adhere to the routines. So if you want to improve your longevity and fitness, then the VO2max challenge is just for you.
