It is important to stay hydrated in the sauna but make sure you're not drinking from a plastic bottle. If you take a plastic bottle into the sauna then the heat is going to mobilize microplastics into your water. These chemicals or xenoestrogens can mess up your hormones and cause other health issues, including fertility problems. It's best to avoid drinking from the water bucket in the sauna as well, especially if it's a public sauna. That's because it might contain different kinds of bacteria and even fecal matter. So if you do want to bring water into the sauna then make sure that it's either in a glass bottle, a stainless steel bottle or a reusable bottle.
