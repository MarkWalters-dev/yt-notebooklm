The top two fitness traits linked to longevity are number one, cardiorespiratory fitness, and number two, muscle strength. But which one is more important? Cardiorespiratory fitness is inversely associated with long term mortality with no observed upper limit of benefit. People with the highest v o two max have a four fold lower risk of mortality compared to the lowest v o two max. Strength training thirty to sixty minutes per week is associated with a seventeen percent lower risk of all cause mortality. However, strength training shows a j shaped curve with the lowest risk at forty to sixty minutes per week and higher risk above a 130 to a hundred forty minutes per week. So both aerobic endurance and strength based exercises are associated with lower risk of mortality. However, a 2018 UK Biobank study found that when compared head to head, cardiorespiratory fitness appeared to give greater reductions in mortality risk. So if you compare head to head, then cardiorespiratory fitness gives you better risk reduction in your all cause mortality. But a combination of high cardiorespiratory fitness and high muscle strength gives the best outcome.
