What is your top supplement for longevity that you take? Well, my favorite supplement is a glycine. Pretty simple as a cheap and effective supplement. The reason I take it is because of methionine balance. So, like, excess methionine can raise homocysteine and can also be or is associated with the shorter lifespans and cancers in animals. But, the methionine is only, like, toxic in relation to low, glycine. You know, it it's not like how much methionine you get. It's also like the balance with the glycine. It's good for glutathione. Again, it's also good for collagen synthesis, lowering the blood sugar levels, helps lower your body temperature, so it's good for sleep. It's inflammation. It's one of my favorite stuff. And then it tastes kinda sweet, so you can add it to coffee or whatever.
