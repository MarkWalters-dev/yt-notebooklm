Stop using plastic kettles for boiling water. I know plastic kettles can be cheaper and more durable. However, they can secretly have a negative effect on your hormones and overall health. Plastic material contains different xenoestrogens that have been shown to negatively affect sperm count, fertility, and sex hormones by mimicking estrogen inside the body. Hot water and boiling mobilize these xenoestrogens and microplastics into your water, and then you drink it. It's estimated that humans absorb up to a credit card size of microplastics every year. These microplastics are in many different everyday items, and you can't fully avoid them. Just be aware of their presence and choose healthier alternatives. For example, use a stainless steel kettle or boil the water in a stainless steel pot. This way, your water is free from hormone disruptors and plastics. Follow for more.
