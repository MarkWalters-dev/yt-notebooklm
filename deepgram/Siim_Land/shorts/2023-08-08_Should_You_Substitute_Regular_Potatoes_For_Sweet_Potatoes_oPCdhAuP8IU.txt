Should you substitute regular potatoes or sweet potatoes? The type of potatoes you choose doesn't really matter, but there's another factor that determines how healthy the potatoes are. What determines which potatoes are the healthiest is not what you expect. If you really want the potatoes you eat to make a difference, then how you cook them is much more important. Baked and mashed potatoes spike your blood sugar quite high. Steaming potatoes makes them moderately glycemic. Shockingly, microwaving your potatoes causes the lowest glycemic response, but letting your potatoes cool after you cook them helps to lower your blood sugar. That's because cooking and cooling your potatoes produces resistant starch in them that has a lower glycemic index. All of the potatoes have this effect but if you want to be more specific then you can choose the type of potatoes you consume. For example, sweet potatoes have a lot more vitamin a than white potatoes but white potatoes have significantly more potassium than other potatoes.
