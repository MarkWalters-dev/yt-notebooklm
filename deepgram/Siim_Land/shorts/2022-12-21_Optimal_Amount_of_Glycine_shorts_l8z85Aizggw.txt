Optimal glycine to protein ratio for intake. Too much glycine bad. So too much glycine is hard to achieve. There's studies even at 90 grams and it has no negative side effects. And what I think the optimal glycine ratio would be that increases your glycine demand. One gram of methionine increases your glycine demand by one gram of glycine. So generally, you wanna have like a balance. So that 50% of your protein comes from methionine rich proteins that have higher methionine like muscle meat, meat, eggs, fish, dairy, and 50% of your protein comes from more glycine dominant proteins, tendons, chicken drumsticks, fish skin. You also wanna take glycine supplements if you are eating like a lot of muscle meat. So I think like ten grams of glycine on top of eating like chicken drumsticks and fish skin is a good way to go about it.
