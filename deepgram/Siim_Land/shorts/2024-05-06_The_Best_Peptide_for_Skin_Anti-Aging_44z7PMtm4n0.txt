Peptides are the new darlings of the antiaging industry. There's one peptide that can help with skin aging. It's called copper peptide GHK. We all know that collagen is needed for skin elasticity and to prevent wrinkles. However, you need copper for collagen and elastin synthesis. GHK has been found to modulate skin regeneration and wound healing. In humans, GHK has sped up skin healing from ulcers by three fold. I've been using the Alitura Gold Serum for over a year and it's had visible improvements in my skin. The Gold Serum has GHK copper tripeptide that helps with skin regeneration, pigmentation, and elasticity. There are also other amazing natural food grade ingredients like marine collagen, organic olive oil, plant retinol, Azteaxanthin, bee propolis, beeswax, coQ10, essential oils and hemp seed oil, all of which support collagen synthesis and skin health. All Alitura skin care products are made of natural ingredients with no microplastics or hormone disruptors unlike conventional brands with the code CEME for 20% discount at alitura.com.
