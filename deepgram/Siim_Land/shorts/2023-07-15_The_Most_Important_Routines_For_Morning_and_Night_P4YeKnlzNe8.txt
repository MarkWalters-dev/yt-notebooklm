Do this every morning and night to completely change your life. Exposure to daylight, especially morning sunlight, is going to kick start your circadian rhythms. All of the longevity pathways that help you to live longer are connected to those circadian rhythms. So for optimal health and longevity, you want to maintain circadian rhythm alignment. You want to aim for at least five to ten minutes of daylight exposure after waking up to synchronize the circadian clocks. In the evening, however, you want to avoid the bright lights especially the ones coming from artificial sources. Naturally, you would get exposed to blue light only during the daytime and this blue light can inhibit melatonin, the sleep hormone. You don't wanna do that because melatonin is not only the sleep hormone but it's also one of the most powerful anti aging hormones in the body. In the evening, you want to block out the blue light. You can do that by using blue blocking glasses, different kinds of filters on your screens and just dimming down the lights. If you follow these two tips then I promise you that your sleep, your mood, your energy levels and your well-being will increase.
