Eating before bed is one of the worst things for your sleep and longevity. Let me explain. Digesting food takes a lot of energy and that will make it harder for your body to repair itself at night when you're sleeping. Eating large amounts of food will also deplete your NADPH levels which recharges your antioxidant potential at night. Basically, your body will be less recovered and more worn out if you load up on calories before bed. On top of that, melatonin, the sleep hormone actually makes you insulin resistant and reduces your insulin sensitivity. This means that your ability to store carbohydrates and lower blood sugar is greatly impaired in the evening. So what I recommend you do is stop eating large amounts of calories three to four hours before bed. A small snack like a bit of yogurt, cottage cheese, or a piece of fruit is fine, but don't have large meals.
