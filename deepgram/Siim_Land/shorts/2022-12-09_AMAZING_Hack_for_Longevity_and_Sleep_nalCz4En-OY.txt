So I do microdose melatonin. I think that's a very good and safe strategy for boosting your antioxidant defense systems as well as reducing inflammation, boosting your immunity and, improving just the overall quality of sleep. So a small amount of melatonin like zero point one to one mg is good to pretty much fall asleep faster and more easily. The amount or those amounts also aren't going to suppress your natural melatonin production at all. So even in studies where they use fifty milligrams, five zero, and even in then it doesn't suppress natural melatonin production. So you would have to take like a huge amount of melatonin for it to have any effect on your natural melatonin production. And even then, I think even if you take a hundred milligrams, I don't think it's gonna suppress your natural melatonin production. The dosages of like seventy five milligrams have been shown to be contraceptive. I wouldn't take any more than three milligrams probably is the maximum that I would take. But one small micro dose zero point one one milligram is safe and actually helps the sleep quality and like the anti aging of your sleep.
