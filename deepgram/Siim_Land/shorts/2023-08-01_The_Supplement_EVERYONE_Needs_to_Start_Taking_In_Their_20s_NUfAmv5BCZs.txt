Just taking supplements is not enough. You also have to take them at the right time. Ninety nine percent of people make the same mistakes when choosing which supplements to take. When choosing any supplement, you do have to consider how old you are. Age is a crucial factor because it drives most of the changes in your body. For example, it's not recommended for children to take any supplements besides just some vitamins. Once you reach your twenties, then there is one supplement that you absolutely need to take which is collagen. Collagen breakdown in your skin already starts in your twenties. It actually occurs at a rate of ten percent per decade. So you shouldn't wait until you're 50 or 60 years old to start taking collagen. You need to start doing it in your twenties already. When you become older, like in your seventies, then you should consider some antioxidant supplementation like NAC or melatonin. That's because your natural antioxidant events decreases with age. Remember, not choosing the right supplements is like wearing a coat in the desert. It just won't make a difference.
