Collagen is very popular. It's one of the most popular antiaging supplements and proteins out there. So in this study, they took two point five grams or five grams of collagen hydrolysate for eight weeks. And the end of that, after four weeks of follow-up, there was statistically significant higher skin elasticity in the group who took the collagen hydrolysate. Another 2015 study found that collagen peptide supplementation had an efficacious improvement in the hallmarks of skin aging. 2021, a newer study found oral supplementation of collagen peptides improves skin hydration by increasing the natural moisturizing factor content in the stratum corneum. A 2019 study also found that a collagen supplement improves skin hydration, elasticity, roughness and density. Now looking at the research and trying it out myself, I do say that yeah, collagen is quite beneficial for mostly like the skin aesthetics and skin anti aging. By reducing wrinkles, increasing elasticity and increasing the skin thickness.
