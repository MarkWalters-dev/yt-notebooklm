Do you feel like you're aging faster than you should? Improving your lifestyle can help to prevent your health from rapidly declining with age. Our bodies deteriorate with age by default. Our VO2 max, muscle strength, skin collagen and sex hormones decrease by about 10% per decade. But doing nothing can actually accelerate this process. So, it's important to moderate your lifestyle to slow down this process as much as possible. Lifting weights, doing cardio, eating a good diet, sleeping enough and taking some supplements can help to slow down aging. Aging is inevitable. We're all gonna age. But the speed of how fast you age depends on your lifestyle. Add some simple habits into your day to slow down aging. Take a walk, exercise regularly, remember to drink enough water, don't overeat, eat a balanced diet and get seven to eight hours of sleep per day. The little changes you make now will have a massive impact on your future health.
