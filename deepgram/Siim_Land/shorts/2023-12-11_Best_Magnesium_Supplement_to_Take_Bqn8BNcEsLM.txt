Magnesium is the master mineral. But which type of magnesium is the best? Here's an overview of the different types of magnesium. Fluorate is for heart and blood pressure, threonate for brain and memory, glycinate, relaxation and sleep, citrate, constipation, lactate, digestion, malate, energy and fatigue, chloride, blood sugar and digestion, orotate, heart and sulfate for muscle soreness. Here are the top three best types of magnesium. Glycinate, it's the safest and also very cheap. Phreonate, because it's highly bioavailable for the brain. And porate, it's safe and effective for the cardiovascular system. Here are the top three worst types of magnesium. Oxide, because it's low bioavailability and is contaminated. Corbonate, because it's low solubility. And three, citrate, because it can cause diarrhea. But at the same time, it's also good for constipation. I'm using MAC six by Nordcode because they have six different types of magnesium with vitamin b six. Head over to livehealthy.com/nordcode and use the code CINC10 for a 10% discount.
