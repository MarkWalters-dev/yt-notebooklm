What if I told you there's a way of cooking with oils without it damaging your health? The manufacturers of certain oils want to keep the truth about their products in the dark. The key to knowing which oil to cook with is knowing its smoking point, is the temperature at which the oil starts to burn and it becomes oxidized. The different fats have a different smoking point at which they become oxidized will cause inflammation and oxidative stress in your body. So that's why the temperature you use to cook your oil with is key. For example, if you want to cook at very high temperatures, the avocado oil has the smoking point of 520 degrees Fahrenheit. Extra virgin olive oil does have a lower smoking point than some other fat, but it contains a lot of polyphenols that actually protect the oil from the oxidation. Foods like fish should be cooked at very low temperatures and for shorter periods of time. Some industrial oils like canola oil or sunflower oil are already oxidized. That's because they're processed at very high temperatures. You want to avoid these oils as much as you can.
