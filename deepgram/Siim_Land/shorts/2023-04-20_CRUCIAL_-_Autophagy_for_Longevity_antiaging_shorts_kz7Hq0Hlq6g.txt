Autophagy is cellular recycling. I put this in this category because it's sort of the quality control. Right? If something's not good, you're gonna recycle it, hopefully. It's been demonstrated that recycling is extremely good for your cell. We tend to do it so when we have low energies, AMP kinase gets activated, you increase your autophagy versus mTOR that you decrease your autophagy. The problem with autophagy in general, 99%, fantastic. We wanna do it. It's good for us. The only problem with it is that every time you sort of take a glob and recycle it, there's a piece that you can't recycle, and it gets shoved in a vesicle in the back of your cell. It just accumulates, and that's called lipo fusion. The older your cell is, the longer lives if it's a short lived cell, you're just gonna shed it, and it's not a big deal. For longer lived cells such as neurons, it accumulates in the cell and can cause a lot of problems just by taking up a lot of space. The more autophagy you have, the more lipofusion you're gonna accumulate. That part's not great. But in general, increasing autophagy is extremely important, and it's associated with longevity.
