Billionaires are investing hundreds of millions of dollars into longevity research. However, there's currently one supplement that almost all the billionaires are taking to slow down their aging. It's Metformin, which is a drug used to treat diabetes. In diabetics, Metformin does reduce the risk of cardiovascular and all cause mortality significantly. But what about otherwise healthy people? In 2014, there was an observational study that suggested that diabetics taking metformin could live 15% longer than non diabetics not taking metformin. Metformin. This is why a lot of biohackers and longevity enthusiasts are taking metformin off label. However, the problem with this study was that it's an observational study, and they didn't control for the other variables. A recent 2022 reassessment of the 2014 study found that metformin was found to be associated with increased mortality across all levels of cumulative use. Meaning that no matter the dose, metformin use was linked to a higher mortality risk primarily because metformin users had diabetes, and diabetics generally have shorter life expectancy. So as of now, there is no evidence that metformin would extend the lifespan in human, all of more.
