You can slow your speed of aging by five years by following this exact diet. Don't believe me? Look at this study. Six women participated in an eight week program that involved adjusting their diet, their sleep, their exercise and supplementation. As a result of that they saw a reduction in their biological age by five years. The diet focused on adding healthy vegetables, seeds, and other whole foods to their daily routine. They ate two cups of dark leafy green vegetables, two cups of cruciferous vegetables, three cups of colorful vegetables along with one to two beets. Their diet also included a quarter cup of pumpkin seeds and a quarter cup of sunflower seeds. On top of that, they took some liver supplements, a greens powder, and some probiotics. You can easily make these adjustments to lower your biological age as well. Start with water. Make sure you drink at least eight cups of water a day and ensure that you get seven to eight hours of sleep per night. You should also include at least thirty minutes of exercise every day. With this diet and lifestyle, you too can reduce your biological age.
