One of the biggest fears people have about taking creatine is that it causes hair loss. However, there's never been a study that actually looked at it until now. A new 2025 study looked at creatine's effects on hair loss and DHT levels and they found that five grams of creatine for twelve weeks had no effect on hair growth, thickness, or density compared to placebo. There was also no difference in testosterone or DHT levels, which is thought to cause hair loss. So at this dose, creatine doesn't cause hair loss. However, there are some people that swear that after taking creatine, they lost some hair. This might be because of genetic predispositions or their baseline DHT levels. Twenty years ago, there was a study that saw that creatine did raise DHT levels in rugby players whose DHT levels were low to begin with. They also used twenty five grams of creatine for seven days followed by five grams for fourteen days. This study didn't look at hair loss, but they saw DHT levels rising 56% in those who had low baseline DHT. So creatine doesn't raise your DHT if your DHT is normal, but it might if it's low. DHT is thought to be one of the reasons why some men lose their hair. They're genetically sensitive to the hair loss effects of DHT. Overall there's no evidence that creatine would cause hair loss. But not everyone reacts the same way to creatine. Follow for more.
