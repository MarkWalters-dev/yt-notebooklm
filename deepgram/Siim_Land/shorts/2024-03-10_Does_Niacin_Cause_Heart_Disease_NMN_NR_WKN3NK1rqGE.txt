Niacin is a form of vitamin b three that's been historically used to manage cholesterol levels. However, a recent 2024 study indicated that niacin might cause vascular inflammation and heart disease. First off, they didn't actually find anything like that because it was mostly a hypothetical study. What they did find was that a metabolite of niacin called 4py promotes vascular inflammation and is associated with increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. They didn't have any human interventions or studies. Instead, they injected thirty milligrams per kilogram of four p y into a mouse aorta, which created an inflammatory response. For a person weighing eighty kilograms or a hundred and seventy six pounds, that would be the equivalent of two thousand four hundred milligrams of four p y. This saw a 12 to 16 fold increase in four p y concentrations. It's not clear how much four p y niacin supplementation would generate, but ingesting up to fifty milligrams of dietary niacin is linked to improved endothelial function, which is protective against heart disease.
