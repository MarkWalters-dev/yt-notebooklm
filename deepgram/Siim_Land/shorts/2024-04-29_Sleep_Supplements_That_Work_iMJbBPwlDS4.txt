If you're struggling with sleep, then try out this sleep combo. It works great and it has other longevity benefits. Number one, glycine is primarily an inhibitory amino acid similar to GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. That's why glycine has been shown to improve sleep quality. Glycine also lowers body temperature which helps with sleep. Number two, NAC. The reason I take glycine with NAC is because of antioxidant defense. Your body's antioxidant defense is the most active during your sleep. That's why it might be better to take NAC before bed together with glycine. A three melatonin is the sleep hormone that's repeatedly shown to improve sleep quality as well as duration in clinical trials. Melatonin levels decrease with age which shortens Number four, magnesium is a mineral with many roles but it also helps with sleep. I take the magnesium before bed to cover my RDA which a lot of people aren't getting. Final disclaimer, bright artificial lights have probably the biggest impact on sleep and melatonin levels. Dim down the lights and get exposed to the sunset or red lights instead. I don't take this stack every night, but if I do, it works. Follow for more.
