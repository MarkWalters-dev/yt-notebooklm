Do you have skinny arms and a round belly? Those are the main signs of being skinny fat. Being skinny fat is much more dangerous to your health than you think. Having low muscle mass, also called sarcopenia, is associated with increased risk of all cause mortality. There's also a bidirectional relationship between sarcopenia and diabetes. Muscle is incredibly important for health and longevity. Muscle increases your insulin sensitivity and helps to lower blood sugar levels. Muscle mass protects against frailty and hip fractures in the elderly. The easiest signs that you have sarcopenia are having skinny arms and legs and a small belly. To know precisely if you do have sarcopenia, then you need to do a DEXA scan to measure your appendicular lean mass, which is the muscle mass of the arms and legs. How do you prevent sarcopenia? Resist the straining, adequate protein intake, and in the elderly, being too low calories also is harmful because of risk of malnutrition. No matter your age, a single bout of resistance training can attenuate muscle atrophy and improve lean mass. So no matter how old or sarcopenic you are, a single workout can turn the ship around.
