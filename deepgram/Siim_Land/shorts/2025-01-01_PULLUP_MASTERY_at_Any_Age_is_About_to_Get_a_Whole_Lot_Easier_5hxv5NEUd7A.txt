Last year, I did 29 pull ups for my 20 birthday. This year, I turned 30 and I had to do 30 pull ups. I was supposed to do it in September when it was my actual birthday, but back then I had a minor elbow injury, which is now completely healed. Can I do more than 30? If I really went all out, I could do maybe 32 or 33, which is why I'll be doing 31 pull ups next year. How long will I be able to keep this up? 40 pull ups at age 40, fifty pull ups at age 50? Theoretically it is possible because I love doing pull ups and I've been doing pull ups for fifteen years. No matter how many pull ups you can do right now, adding them to your routine will improve your physique and strength. Pull ups decompress your spine. They're good for your shoulder mobility and grip strength. I built a very wide back doing only regular pull ups and weighted pull ups. I remember being able to do only two or three in middle school and about eight in high school. In my twenties, I did hundreds of pull ups divided into sets of 10, sets of 20, and sets of 25 to increase my overall pull up strength. Start with doing pull ups to 80% of your maximum repetitions for three sets three times per week, and each of those workouts go for the maximum amounts of reps at least once. Follow for more.
