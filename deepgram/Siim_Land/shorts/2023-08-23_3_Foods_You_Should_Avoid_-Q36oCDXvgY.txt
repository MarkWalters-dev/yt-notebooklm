Don't be fooled by the illusion of healthy food choices. If you're in the supermarket and you're looking for healthy food, you might immediately go for the green packaging and buzzwords like non GMO or vegan. But many of these products are deceiving and actually bad for you. Number one, margarine. Many people choose margarine instead of butter. Margarine has the same amount of calories as regular butter. And what's more, the trans fats inside margarine are linked to a whole host of health issues like atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Number two is beyond meat. Like Impossible Burger have little to no nutritional value. They contain as much calories as regular meat and even more and they're also full of synthetic chemicals and artificial ingredients. Number three is granola. Might seem healthy but most granola products are full of extra added sugar. If you want to eat something crunchy for breakfast then choose something like muesli. By understanding these principles and reading the labels, you know what you're putting inside your body. So the next time you see a label that says healthy, make sure you double check it.
