Don't overheat your balls. Heat exposure to the testicles, definite way to shut down spermatogenesis and reduce sperm count. Back in the last century, they also used saunas as a contraceptive against men. You don't wanna be overheating your balls and testicles with too much heat by wearing too tight underwear, having your laptop on your lap, being in a sauna for too much, and just having the legs crossed as well is harmful. Optimally, you want to keep your legs spread and not have them crossed and too tight together, cooling down the testicles with some cold water or ice packs is also a great way to increase sperm count and have even small positive effect on testosterone production.
