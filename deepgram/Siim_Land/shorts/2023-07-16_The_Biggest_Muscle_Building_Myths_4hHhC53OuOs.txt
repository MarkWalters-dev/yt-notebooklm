The fitness industry is full of BS. Don't fall for it. These are some of the biggest myths. Myth number one. You can't build muscle with intermittent fasting. This is false. You can easily build muscle with intermittent fasting as long as you get enough protein in the day. You just want to make sure that you get adequate amount of protein, which in most cases for people will be around 0.7 to one gram of protein per pound of body weight. Number two, you can't build muscle with lighter weights. This is also false. The most important factor for muscle growth is mechanical tension. Your body doesn't tell the difference whether or not the weight is heavy or light. It only detects mechanical tension. Mechanical tension pretty much describes the amount of force you apply to your muscles. Mechanical tension can be achieved with both lighter weights and heavier weights. It's just that with heavier weights you need to do less reps to achieve that whereas with lighter weights you might need to do more reps.
