There's only one thing you need to pay attention to while eating and you probably already have these at home. To improve your longevity you want to eat foods that contain Spermidine. Spermidine is a polyamine that is found in many healthy foods. It's been found that getting eleven milligrams of of spermidine a day is associated with up to thirty percent reduced risk of mortality. That's because spermidine has many anti aging benefits. It protects your heart, your cardiovascular system, increases autophagy and just has anti inflammatory effects. Foods Foods that contain the most spermidine include wheat, mushrooms, cheeses, vegetables, meat and spirulina. Just make sure that you get spermidine from food because we don't have any evidence that supplemental spermidine would improve longevity, at least not yet.
