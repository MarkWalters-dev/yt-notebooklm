Don't take a water bottle into the sauna. Let me explain. I understand that the sauna can get very hot and you sweat a lot. Dehydration can be quite harmful in the long run and you may even faint. However, don't take an actual plastic bottle into the sauna. The heat is going to secrete some of the micro plastics inside the bottle into your water. These micro plastics can have a harmful effect on your hormones and fertility. So either drink your water from a glass bottle or a metal flask, but definitely don't take a plastic bottle into the sauna. If you do have a water in inside a plastic bottle, then just drink it outside of the sauna when it's not exposed to the heat.
