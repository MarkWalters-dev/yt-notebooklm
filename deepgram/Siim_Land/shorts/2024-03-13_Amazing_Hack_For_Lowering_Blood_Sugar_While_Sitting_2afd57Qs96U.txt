We know sitting too long is bad for your health. Unfortunately, there are many times we have to sit, like when working, driving, or flying. There's one amazing seated exercise hack that can improve your health. It's called the soleus push up or calf push up. A 2022 study showed that contractions of the soleus were able to lower glucose levels after a meal by 50% and insulin levels by 60%. The soleus is a unique muscle because it uses mostly glucose and not glycogen like other muscles. That's why walking is such a good thing for your health. You're burning the glucose in your bloodstream just by walking, which then helps to prevent diabetes. If you can't walk, you can still stimulate the soleus muscles by doing soleus push ups or seated calf raises. You can literally do it for hours and not get tired while still lowering your blood sugar levels. You don't have to do it the entire time you're sitting, but I would recommend doing at least ten minute sets every forty five minutes while you're sitting. Follow more.
