You don't need to buy organic foods to be healthy. Instead you need to know which products are safe for you to consume non organic and which foods you should consume as organic. The dirty dozen is a list of 12 foods that have the highest amount of pesticides. Strawberries are a well known fruit on this list which is why you should try to eat organic strawberries. On the other hand, foods like potatoes are safe to be consumed non organic because they grow underground and they don't get exposed to that much pesticides. Even if the fruit or vegetables that you buy is non organic, it's still healthier for you than processed food. If you can't afford organic berries then it's still healthier for you to choose the non organic berries than a candy bar. So, eat as healthy as possible, eat as healthy as you can afford, and don't let the word non organic turn you away from otherwise healthy foods.
