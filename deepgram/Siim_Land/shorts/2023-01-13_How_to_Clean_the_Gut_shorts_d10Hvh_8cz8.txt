Best way to clean the gut, that depends on, you know, what's the issue. Is it IBS? Is it constipation? Is it some other bacterial dysbiosis or colitis or whatever? Like, yeah, the different gut issues and different reasons to clean the gut. I wouldn't think that it's, like, smart. You just nuke the gut for no reason. If you don't have any symptoms, you don't experience any complaints about your gut, then there's no reason to try to clean it deliberately or nuke it for no other reason. But generally, some periods of fasting with bacterial infections works very good. Bacteria definitely die out if you don't feed them. Fasting is very good for bacterial infections generally.
