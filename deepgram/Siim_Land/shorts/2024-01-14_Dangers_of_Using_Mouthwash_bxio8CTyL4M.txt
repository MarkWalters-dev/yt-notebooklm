Mouthwash can be a quick and easy way to freshen your breath. However, did you know that using mouthwash may increase the risk of developing diabetes? People using mouthwash twice a day have been seen to have a fifty five percent higher risk of developing pre diabetes or diabetes compared to those not using mouthwash at all. The reason for that is thought to be the mouthwash wiping out your beneficial oral bacteria. These bacteria help you to digest food and determine your insulin sensitivity. Mouthwash wipes out your oral bacteria, which then worsens your insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, and it's going to rage your blood sugar levels. Another study found that mouthwash reduces the benefits of exercise on cardiovascular health by eliminating nitric oxide boosting bacteria in the mouth.

So if you want to really improve your oral health, then floss and brush. Follow for more.
