If you struggle with dieting, then you wanna stop scrolling. One of the biggest psychological challenges to dieting is hunger. But here's how you can manage your appetite. Sometimes hunger is just dehydration that you can overcome by just drinking a little bit of water. Sparkling water especially is very beneficial. The carbonation helps to lower your appetite even more than regular water. If you're feeling a little bit of hunger, drink some water and then wait a little bit. Chances are the hunger will go away after you hydrate. If your main goal is just pure weight loss, then Diet Coke and Diet Sodas are also fine. They have virtually no calories and they're pretty satiating. But if you're the kind of person who gets more cravings from consuming artificial sweeteners and Diet Coke, then just avoid it. Another thing for hunger is to not be surrounded by food. If you have some snickers bar playing around you all the time then eventually you will eat it. So if you're dieting then it's better to minimize your exposure to unhealthy food and different kinds of snacks.
