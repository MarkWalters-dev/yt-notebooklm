Don't waste money on these supplements part two. Number one, spermidine. Spermidine is a polyamine that has many longevity benefits in humans. Dietary spermidine intake has been linked to reduced mortality in humans. However, randomized clinical trials have found that spermidine from supplements doesn't have those same effects. In fact, one study saw that spermidine supplementation didn't even raise blood spermidine levels even at high doses. Thus, it's better to focus on eating more foods that have spermidine such as legumes, cheese, vegetables, mushrooms, etcetera. Number two, nicotinamide riboside. This is an NAD booster that's said to have longevity benefits. It's true that NR has some benefits such as DNA repair and lowering inflammation. However, it hasn't been seen to extend lifespan even in animals. I think NR can be good for someone who experiences aging or inflammation. However, it doesn't appear to have any additional longevity benefits in otherwise healthy people. Number three, different types of creatine. There are many different types of creatine out there. However, none of these types of creatine having shown to be superior to regular creatine monohydrate. Follow for
