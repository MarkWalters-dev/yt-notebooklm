Triglycerides are fatty acids in the bloodstream. Two triglycerides are linked to metabolic syndrome, heart disease, and high amounts of visceral fat. For optimal health, you need to get your triglycerides below a hundred milligrams per deciliter. The biggest reason triglycerides rise is because they're not being burned for energy. This occurs mostly if you're consuming more calories than your body burns or are eating a large amount of carbohydrates. Losing weight and eating at an energy deficit will lower your triglycerides no matter the diet. However, carbohydrate restriction is one of the most effective ways to lower triglycerides. That's because your body will be burning the triglycerides for energy in the absence of glucose. This doesn't mean you can't do the same on a low fat diet. You can. The biggest problem arises when you're eating a high carb and a high fat diet at the same time. Your body has a large influx of fats, and because you're not burning them for fuel in the presence of glucose, they stay elevated in the blood. Other things that lower triglycerides include exercise, especially cardio, weight loss, omega three fatty acids, and curcumin, all of them more.
