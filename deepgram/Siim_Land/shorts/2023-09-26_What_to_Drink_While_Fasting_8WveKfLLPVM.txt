Don't know what to drink besides water while fasting? It depends what your goal is with the fast. If you're skipping breakfast because you just want to lose some weight and avoid unnecessary calories, then you can still have some coffee with even like a little bit of milk in it. Technically, it does break a fast but it doesn't mean that you can't use it to lose weight. If you skip breakfast because you're in a hurry but you want to build some muscle, then what I would recommend you do is just drink a protein shake. It takes one minute to prepare and you get enough protein to promote muscle growth. If you're fasting for the antiaging and longevity benefits for things like autophagy, then theoretically, it is better to avoid anything that has calories. So just stick to teas, regular black coffee or water. These drinks also make fasting much more easier and enjoyable, so try them out.
