I think that the best longevity supplement or two of them, glycine and creatine. Glycine for the methionine balance, glutathione, collagen lowers blood sugar, helps with inflammation, helps with sleep because you're also not getting that much glycine from diet. Creatine is a longevity supplement. It helps with cognition, bones, muscle strength, fat loss, methylation. And in your forties or under forties, then chicken creatine, it's going to build up your reserve in terms of muscle mass and muscle strength and bone density. Because it's much easier to build strength and bone density in your twenties than it is in your forties, not to mention in your sixties. So you need to kind of cap out or maximize your potential in terms of lifting and, like fitness to maximize your bone density and muscle strength. Muscle strength is more the most associated with, longevity more so than muscle mass. So even if you're not trying to build muscle mass, muscle strength is still quite, acute and important.
