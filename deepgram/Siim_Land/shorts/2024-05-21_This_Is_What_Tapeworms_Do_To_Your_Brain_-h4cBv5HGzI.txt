This is what tapeworms do to your brain. You can see a lot of cysts and lesions in the brain structures caused by a condition called neurocysticercosis. This isn't some made up scenario or fiction. It's an actual case report published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2019. An 18 year old man felt pain in his groin for a week and was taken to the ER by his parents. After the MRI, the doctors saw cysts across his brain caused by a tapeworm infection. He wasn't treated with anti parasitic medication because of the severe cysts which could have caused inflammation and loss of vision. Unfortunately, two weeks later, the patient died. So how do you make sure you never experience anything like this? You can get tapeworms through contact with feces and eating raw or uncooked meat or fish. Tapeworms can spread to surfaces as well as people if you don't wash the hands. So wash your hands after going to the bathroom, especially public restrooms. Don't touch cow feces without washing your hands afterwards and cook your meat. Follow for more.
