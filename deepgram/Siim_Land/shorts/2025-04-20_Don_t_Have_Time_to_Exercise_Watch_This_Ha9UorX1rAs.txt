Watch this if you don't have time to work out every day. If you don't have time to work out that often, you can still get the same benefits on your cardio respiratory fitness by working out only on the weekends. Here's how. A brand new study on people training either four times a week with shorter workouts or twice a week with longer workouts resulted in similar v o two max adaptations. The catch is that you had to work out twice as much. Here's what the protocols look like. The high frequency training group who trained four times a week did twice a week of thirty five minutes of continuous cardio at around 80% of their max heart rate and twice a week of high intensity intro training with four minutes at 95% max heart rate, three minutes rest repeated for four rounds. The weekend warrior group did one day of seventy minutes of continuous cardio at 80% max heart rate and one day of hit with the same protocol. Basically, they combined all the workouts into one day. The takeaway is that if their weekly volume is the same, you can see similar improvements in your VO2 max by training only two days a week. You just have to workout twice as much in a single workout which is both good news and bad news. The good news is that you can compress your weekly cardio into only one day if you just do a lot of cardio. The bad news is that yes, you have to do a lot of cardio in one workout. Follow for more.
