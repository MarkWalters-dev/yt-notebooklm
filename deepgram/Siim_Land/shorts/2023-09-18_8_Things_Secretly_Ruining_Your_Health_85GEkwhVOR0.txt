These things are secretly ruining your health. Do you sometimes feel bad but can't seem to find out why? You won't believe how common these harmful things are. To protect their health, you absolutely need to avoid house mold, heavy metals in the water you drink, air pollution, excess artificial light, chronic stress, mouth breathing and negative self talk. Many of these things expose you to harmful substances and increase your risk of diseases like asthma and cancer. Others take a toll on your mental health which is essential for your body to remain healthy. Being exposed to these things can be just as bad as smoking, drinking and other unhealthy behaviors. Make sure your environment is safe.
