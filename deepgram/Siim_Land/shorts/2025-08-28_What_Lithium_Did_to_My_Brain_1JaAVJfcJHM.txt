I microdosed lithium for two weeks, and I'm going to share with you my experience. No, I'm not talking about licking batteries. Here we go. I'm talking about lithium supplements that are often used to improve mood and brain health. Lithium supplements have become quite popular online, which is why I dug up the old research and decided to try it again. I took five milligrams of lithium orotate every day and my general experience was that my mood was slightly more elevated. Then I stopped taking lithium to see if I revert back to baseline. Now I don't have any bipolar disorder, mania, or depression or anything like that, so I wouldn't be experiencing a massive difference anyway. But those five milligrams a day were noticeable. I would say my mood was maybe 5% better, and I think my concentration on work was also about 5% better. Of course, this isn't the double blind placebo controlled randomized controlled trial. It's just my own subjective experience that has the risk of placebo. However, there is actual clinical research showing that lithium does improve mood and prevent mood episodes prophylactically. Most of that research is done on people with bipolar disorder because lithium has historically been used to treat bipolar disorder. In fact, lithium is the gold standard for treating bipolar disorder and mania. I'm not gonna be taking lithium all the time because I don't think I need it, but I will add it to my snack whenever I need to support my mood or, cognition.
