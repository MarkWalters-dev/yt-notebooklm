I've tried quite a lot of different long fasts in my life lasting from three to five to seven days. They did feel quite good, and I noticed some benefits. However, I'm not doing very long fasts anymore, and here's why. Basically, extended fasting for three to five days wasn't supporting my goals. A few years ago, I wanted to increase my fitness and strength because there's a lot of research about their longevity benefits. There's very limited research about the longevity benefits of extended fasting. Of course, it can help you to lose weight and improve some biomarkers, but exercise does that as well, and you can still do daily time restricted eating that achieves similar benefits. I'm eating one to two meals per day, and I think it gives me already all the benefits of fasting. On top of that, I'm now much fitter and in better shape than I was back then because of focusing more on exercise. Exercise is the most powerful activity for increasing health span and slowing down aging. Doing a few extended fasts up to forty eight hours is fine with no real side effects. I might still throw one in when I'm traveling out of convenience. However, I'm not deliberately scheduling three to five day fasts. Follow for more.
