A new article talked about a study that speculated that Americans eat up to 3,800,000 bits of microplastics every year from protein alone. These microplastics have been shown to disrupt your hormones, reduce fertility, and cause weight gain. I'm going to tell you the biggest sources of these microplastics in your everyday life. Number one, plastic bottles. Just recently, scientists found about a quarter million invisible nano plastic particles in a liter of bottled water, but all plastic containers, including the ones that are BPA free, contain microplastics. Number two, proteins, like we just talked about. Commercial meats like chicken, pork, and seafood contain some microplastics because of the packaging. And because the meat is wet, they absorb a lot more of the microplastics from the package. Cosmetics and personal hygiene products, putting them on your skin makes you absorb them through the skin, opt for more natural brands. While this may sound depressing, unfortunately, microplastics are found everywhere, but there are ways to excrete them especially through the sweat of more.
