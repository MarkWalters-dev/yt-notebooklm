I took different types of methylene blue for a month to see whether or not it makes me feel worse or better. Some say methylene blue is a miracle drug that saved their life, whereas others claim it's toxic and it's going to reduce your energy production. Methylene blue acts as an alternative electron carrier that bypasses complex one and three activity in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Methylene blue also stimulates complex four activity which increases oxygen consumption and energy output through cytochrome c oxidase. This means that methylene blue can support energy production during mitochondrial dysfunction or damaged complex one and three in the electron transport chain. What about my results? What did I experience? Overall, I didn't notice anything. Maybe it's because my mitochondria are working so well and my metabolism is in peak condition that I don't notice a thing. I didn't notice any improvement but I also didn't notice any decline in my energy or brain performance which isn't surprising. Overall, methylene blue is very interesting. It doesn't have a lot of clinical trials, but the clinical evidence that we have suggests that it might have some benefits in treating certain conditions that are characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction or energy impairment such as neurodegeneration, traumatic brain injury or something else like that. I might see myself using methylene blue if I am going to experience some aspects of energy deprivations such as during flights. If you are flying, especially long haul flights, then methylene blue might come in handy. But I don't see myself using it on a daily basis. Follow for more.
