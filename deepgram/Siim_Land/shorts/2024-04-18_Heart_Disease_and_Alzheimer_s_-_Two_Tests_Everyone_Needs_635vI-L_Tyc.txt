Two markers everyone should test at least once in their life. Number one, APOE gene. It's the biggest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's. Number two, LPA, strongest genetically determined atherogenic lipoprotein in heart disease. Let me explain. The apoE four gene allele is the biggest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. ApoE four four is considered the highest risk. Two and three are the lowest and three and three is the intermediate risk. ApoE is genetically determined so you need to get a DNA test but you only need to do it once in your life because your genetics don't change. LPA or Lipoprotein a is the strongest genetically determined atherogenic lipoprotein. LPA levels can vary a thousand fold between people ranging from close to zero to 300 milligrams per deciliter. LPA below 50 milligrams per deciliter is considered normal but above five already is linked to a higher risk of heart disease. Getting a blood test for LPA once in your life can give you a lot of insight into your genetic risk for heart disease. Follow for more.
