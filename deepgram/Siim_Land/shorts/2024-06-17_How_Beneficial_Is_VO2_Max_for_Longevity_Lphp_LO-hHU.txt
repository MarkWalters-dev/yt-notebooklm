VO2 max is one of the biggest predictors of reduction in mortality risk. And based on studies, the individuals with the most extreme or the highest amount of VO2 max have up to four times lower risk of all cause mortality than the lowest quartile of people in terms of VO2max. This is obviously a very huge difference. Smoking generally increases your mortality risk by two to three times or two hundred percent. If you are obese and you smoke then that number is five times, but being the lowest bottom, the lowest quartile of VO2 max increases your mortality risk by four times compared to the highest.
