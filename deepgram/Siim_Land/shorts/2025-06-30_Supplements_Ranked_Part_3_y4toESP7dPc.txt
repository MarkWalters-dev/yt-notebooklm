Sim ranked these supplements from one to 10. Niacinamide. Seven. Mostly helps with NAD recycling. Doesn't have a lot of other benefits, but, it's a very easy and cheap NAD booster through NAD recycling pathway. Essential amino acids. 4.5 or five. There's nothing in these essential amino acids that you couldn't get from diet. So they're mostly, like, supplementing a lower protein intake. They're not gonna build muscle in of itself. So you could just eat something regular that has protein or take a whey protein supplement because whey protein has all the essential amino acids as well. Citrulline. Seven point five. It's very beneficial for, blood flow and circulation, so you can use it for exercise performance. Iron. I think for most people, it's it's a three because, high iron levels can be a risk factor for, heart disease and, especially for men who already have higher iron levels, then, it's definitely a no go. But for women who are anemic or low iron, then, it's one option to raise iron status, but you could also eat whole foods. Magnesium melatonin. 10. It's, the best. Magnesium is the most bioavailable for for the brain. Melatonin. I think melatonin is nine, so most people don't inherently need it for sleep. But it has proven benefits for sleep and it's effective for sleep. But the best benefits are actually the anti inflammatory and potential, longevity benefits.
