Why some people shouldn't jog. Jogging is one of the easiest and cheapest forms of exercise, but is it safe? Jogging isn't the best form of cardio for everyone, but there are many alternatives that you can still follow. Jogging will certainly improve your cardio respiratory fitness which is one of the best predictors of mortality. Jogging is a zone two cardio form which means that it's low intensity. Zone two is a tempo that requires some effort but it doesn't leave you breathless. However, jogging can be hard on your joints if you have weak knees or poor running form. There are other forms of zone two cardio that achieve the same effect such as cycling or swimming. But if you have proper running form and you have strong knees, then you shouldn't really have pain while jogging. Many people are afraid that lifting weights causes knee pain, but lifting weights is actually the best thing for strengthening your knees. The bottom line is that find a form of exercise that you can follow without pain.
