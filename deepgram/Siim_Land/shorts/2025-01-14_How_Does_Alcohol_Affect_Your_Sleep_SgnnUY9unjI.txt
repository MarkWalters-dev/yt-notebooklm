Alcohol is often used for stress management and falling asleep. However, alcohol at any doses has a substantial effect on your sleep quality as shown by a recent meta analysis. They analyzed 27 studies and found that low doses less than zero point fifty grams per kilogram, alcohol reduced REM sleep, which is when dreaming occurs. If you weigh eighty kilograms like me, then that will be the equivalent of forty grams of alcohol. For comparison, a glass of wine or a can of beer has about 14 grams of alcohol. Even at doses of zero point thirty five grams per kilogram, alcohol increased REM sleep onset latency, which means you fell into dreaming much later. At larger doses of over zero point eighty five grams per kilogram, alcohol reduced sleep onset latency, which means that it took less time to to fall asleep. For me, that would be the equivalent of sixty eight grams of alcohol, which I would get from around five drinks. Overall, it seems that alcohol has a much more negative effect on your sleep quality if you drink more than five drinks. It makes you fall asleep faster, but the quality of your sleep is worse because you get less REM sleep. REM sleep is when dreams and memory consolidation occurs, so you don't want to miss that. If you do drink, then stick to much smaller amounts of alcohol such as less than zero point thirty five grams per kilogram, which you would get from around two drinks. Follow for more.
