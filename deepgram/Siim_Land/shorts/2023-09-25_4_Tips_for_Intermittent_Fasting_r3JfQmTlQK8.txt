Fasting isn't about starving. It's about adjusting. Follow these four tips to make fasting easier. Number one. Try to eat an early dinner. This will, in most cases, help you to sleep better and lose weight. It's also better for you in terms of longevity. Number two, find zero calorie drink alternatives when you're hungry. Sparkling water or mineral water are amazing for staving of hunger and keeping your body hydrated. Number three, take walks out in the morning when the sun is out. This aligns your body with the natural circadian rhythms which will improve your mood, your energy, and your satiety. And number four, stop eating when you're 80% full. Most people stop eating when they're a 100% full. But by that time, it's too late already. Instead, stop eating at 80% full because it means that you're gonna eat a little bit less calories and you'll actually end up reaching the 100% in a few minutes. Make a few of these adjustments and you'll find fasting much easier.
