There was a recent study that showed that eating a 100 grams of protein after a workout was superior to eating 25 grams of protein. The question I've been getting a lot ever since is that, how do you eat a 100 grams of protein in one meal? Basically, I consume two protein meals per per day. One, I take 30 grams of protein powder before my workout, and two, I eat around a 100 grams after my workout. It's quite easy to get a 100 grams of protein if you eat leaner high protein foods. For example, a 100 grams of chicken breast or steak have about 25 to 30 grams of protein. If you eat, like, 300 grams or 10 ounces of meat, you're already getting 75 to 90 grams of protein. Overall, this study doesn't mean that you need to force feed yourself a 100 grams of protein in one meal. You can have several meals if that's what needed. But if you are struggling with meeting your daily protein, then I recommend using a protein powder. Whey protein is the most bioavailable protein in the world. The protein powder I use is from Nordcode. They have grass fed organic whey from The Alps. Use code sim 10 at livehealthy.com forward /collections/ nordcode for 10% discount.
