One of the biggest predictors of my longevity would be things like having good bone density. So bone density, especially in the second half of life, can be a huge risk factor for dying from falls. One of the biggest cause of accidental deaths among the elderly is, falls. Know, you can measure your bone density with a DEXA scan, and I have, you know, high bone density. The second, I guess, big predictor is also, like, VO two max. So like I said, VO two max already declines in your early twenties. In my early twenties, my VO two max was probably quite bad. I didn't measure it back then, but I didn't do a lot of cardio. Whereas over the last three three years or something, I have started do a lot more cardio, and I've managed to increase my VO two max, quite high thanks to that as well. So, you know, maintaining it now is the goal. Third would be just all the blood marker tests. So just looking at things like cholesterol, blood sugar, inflammation, liver enzymes, all those things, and tweaking them. Just measuring them necessarily isn't going to do the trick. You also need to just improve them. You do the blood work and you see, like, okay. My homocysteine is a bit high. What What can I do to improve that? My whatever. Kidney markers are a bit bad or whatever. I can improve that. So measuring and improving is the is the takeaway. Fourth, maybe getting married. So I got married two and a half years ago. Marriage for men, especially, predicts longevity. It's much less so for women for some reason. But for men, getting married appears to be much more important for longevity. And, five would be sleep. In my early twenties, I kind of neglected sleep a bit, but, now I'm getting quite consistent good sleep. So yeah.
