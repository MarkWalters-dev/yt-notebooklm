Magnesium deficiency can be one of the most dangerous things to your health. It can promote insulin resistance, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and heart disease. The human body contains only about 25 grams of magnesium, but magnesium is required for over 300 enzymes and it partakes in fundamental processes like ATP and energy production. Magnesium deficiency can lead to intracellular sodium and calcium accumulation. This promotes arterial vasospasms, blood vessel constriction, hypertension, and hypercoagulability. Low magnesium promotes endothelial dysfunction, thrombosis, and atherosclerosis, which eventually lead to cardiovascular disease. The risk of type two diabetes is twenty three percent lower when getting about three hundred and sixty to seven hundred and seventy milligrams of magnesium per day compared to a hundred and fifty to two hundred and sixty milligrams per day. Magnesium intake is inversely associated with coronary artery calcification with the risk being lowest at four hundred and fifty milligrams of magnesium per day. The RDA for magnesium is around three hundred and fifty to four hundred and twenty milligrams a day, which around fifty percent of people don't get.
