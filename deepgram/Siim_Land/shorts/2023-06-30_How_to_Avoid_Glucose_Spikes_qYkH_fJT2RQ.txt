I know a lot of you think this is disgusting, but it's the number one way to control your glucose spikes. Every time you eat a meal, especially if it has some sugar or carbohydrates, then your glucose is gonna rise. Now that's a natural process and it's fine, but chronically elevated blood sugar levels are gonna lead to a whole host of health issues. If your blood sugar levels are elevated all the time, then you might eventually get kidney problems, vision problems, heart problems, and nerve issues. The easiest, quickest, short term way to flatten the glucose curve is to add some apple cider vinegar to your meals. Adding two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar to a meal that contains a bagel or juice has been found to lower the blood sugar response by 55%. But it doesn't have to be apple cider vinegar. Any kind of vinegar does the the trick. The main key ingredient is the acetic acid inside the vinegar. Acetic acid slows down the rate at which you absorb food and thus it lowers the blood sugar response. So this method tastes a bit sour, but the results are quite sweet.
