Vitamin d is one of the most important hormones in your body that's involved with the immune system, hormones, and longevity. Unfortunately, about forty two percent of people are vitamin d deficient. The most common reason for that is obviously not getting enough sunlight. But there are other reasons why your vitamin d levels might be low. The second most common reason might be that you're magnesium deficient. Magnesium is a mineral that activates vitamin d. The second reason is excess body fat. And obese people have been found to have 50% less bioavailable vitamin d. Reason number three is not getting enough sulfur. Sulfur from your diet, which you can get from foods like cruciferous vegetables, meat, and eggs, helps to produce vitamin d sulfate. The next reason could be low boron. Boron is a mineral that is important for the hormones, but it also increases the half life of active vitamin d. So overall, you do want to get exposed to natural sunlight within reason, but sometimes it might not be enough because of certain nutrient deficiencies or the status of your body composition.
