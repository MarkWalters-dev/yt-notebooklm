Longevity experts disagree about basically everything. However, there's one supplement almost all of them take. The supplement I'm talking about is omega threes. Omega threes, especially DHA and EPA, have been seen to improve insulin acidity, lower inflammation, and reduce cholesterol levels. A A 2021 analysis discovered that people with the highest blood levels of EPA and DHA had a fifteen to eighteen percent lower risk of total mortality, and they also had nine to twenty one percent lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease compared to the individuals with the lowest levels. Low levels of omega three fats are linked to early onset coronary atherosclerosis. A 2022 study also found that the risk of Alzheimer's disease among the highest red blood cell DHA was forty nine percent lower compared to the lowest group. The optimal intake of omega threes appears to be somewhere between one point seventy five to two point five grams per day. That's EPA and DHA combined. Eating just fish isn't enough to reach that amount. Unfortunately, a lot of fish oil supplements are rancid and oxidized. That's why you want to use a reputable brand that's quality tested.
