Taking an ice bath immediately after lifting weights is something you definitely don't want to do. There have been numerous studies showing that post workout cold exposure can blunt some of the positive effects of muscle growth and muscle hypertrophy, but there is actually a much better time to get exposed to colds. There are also many studies showing that cooling down before exercise, also known as pre cooling, can actually boost your physical performance. Pre cooling before exercise can increase your endurance by four to 16%. The reason has to do with the fact that overheating is is one of the biggest things that hinders your performance. The goal is to lower your core temperature by about 0.3 degrees Celsius, which isn't that much. The fastest and most convenient way to do this is to use ice packs on the forehead or hands and feet. Too much cold before exercise can also be counterproductive and actually decrease your performance. So the goal is to just cool down the body slightly.
