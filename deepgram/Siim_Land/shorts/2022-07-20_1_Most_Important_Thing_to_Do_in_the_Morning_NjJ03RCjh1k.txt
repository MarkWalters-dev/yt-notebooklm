I think, like I said, the bright light exposure is important. I think it's very underrate. Like the best morning routine or the only morning routine thing that you should do, like you don't have to meditate, you don't have to take a cold shower. The only thing that you should do in the morning is to just get exposed to bright light and, preferably, yeah, like from the sun or natural sunlight, that is gonna be the best because you get a full spectrum of wavelengths that also helps you to produce melatonin at night and it's just the kind of healthiest natural way to kick start circadian rhythm and to produce all the necessary hormones.
