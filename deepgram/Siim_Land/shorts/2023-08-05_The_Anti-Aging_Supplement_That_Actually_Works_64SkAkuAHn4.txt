This is the anti aging supplement that actually works. Just by taking this supplement you'll be able to reduce aging and slow it down. Knowing which supplements work better for your body is crucial when it comes to health and anti aging. To reduce aging and slow it down, you want to take glynaq, a combination of glycine and n a c. Multiple human clinical trials have shown that glynaq supplementation reduces the hallmarks of aging and improves markers of health. There's a scientific reason for this. Both glycine and n a c increase your glutathione levels. Glutathione is your body's master antioxidant that helps to boost your immune system and protect it against inflammation and oxidative stress. It's certainly a game changer for the elderly. But what if I'm a younger person, should I still take glycine and NSE? Now it is still unknown if glynex augmentation in younger individuals is worthwhile but it's certainly very beneficial for the elderly who don't produce enough glutathione.
