Most people take collagen for the sake of anti aging and beauty but, collagen is still one of the best longevity supplements. Collagen is important for maintaining joint health, reducing symptoms of osteoarthritis, knee pain and also improving skin health, skin hydration and reducing the sign of visible wrinkles. Now, the reason why you want to take collagen at all ages is that your collagen degradation starts already in your twenties. Women have slightly less collagen probably because they have less total skin protein because they're somewhat smaller than men, but both genders do lose their collagen and both genders will benefit from increasing their collagen intake. Even if you're not interested in wrinkles or skin aging, taking collagen for the sake of your joints is one of the most important things for longevity because if you're immobile then your risk of diabetes and obesity skyrockets.
