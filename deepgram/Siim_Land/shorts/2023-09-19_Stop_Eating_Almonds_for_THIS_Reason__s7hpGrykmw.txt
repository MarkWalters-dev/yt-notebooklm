Stop eating almonds. While almonds can be good for you, the bigger picture is actually much more damaging. Growing almonds is environmentally very harmful and it requires a lot of water. On average it takes about one gallon of water to grow one single almond and you need millions of almonds to feed people. Almonds are very popular among health and fitness enthusiasts as well as celebrities but the almond industry doesn't want you to know how harmful almond farming actually is. Nutritionally, on paper, almonds are a great source of nutrition but environmentally they're disastrous. Make better food decisions. Make more environmentally friendly decisions by choosing nuts like walnuts or hazelnuts.
