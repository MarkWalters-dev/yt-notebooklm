Your kidneys are invaluable because they excrete toxins from your body. Poor kidney function can lead to heart disease, and fifty percent of people with kidney disease die to heart disease. Here are the foods that damage your kidneys. Number one, phosphorus is a mineral that in excess is associated with key damage and renal insufficiency. High phosphorus intake from meat, dairy, and soft drinks is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality even among people with normal kidney function. However, phosphorus is not harmful to the kidneys if you get enough magnesium. Phosphorus reduces magnesium absorption and low magnesium increases the risk of kidney damage. Thus, you want to increase your magnesium intake from pumpkin seeds, vegetables, nuts, and seafood. Number two, acidic foods such as cheese, meat, and soft drinks can promote metabolic acidosis, which damages the kidneys. A high dietary acid load predicts end stage renal disease in adults with chronic kidney disease. Animal proteins are significantly higher in acid than plant based foods. Eating more alkaline foods such as fruits and vegetables can reduce dietary acid load and metabolic acidosis for more.
