You might have heard about the health benefits of the sauna for the heart and brain. Taking a sauna over four times a week is linked to a sixty three percent reduced heart disease mortality and forty percent lower all cause mortality risk. However, there have been a few recent studies that have made me even more optimistic about using the sauna. In one of them, men with high inflammation and who took the sauna less than two times per week had a higher risk of all cause mortality than men with high inflammation but who took the sauna over three times per week. On top of that, the risk of mortality wasn't much different between men with normal inflammation but low sauna frequency and men with high inflammation and high sauna frequency. So the men who had normal inflammation but they didn't go to the sauna that much had a very similar mortality risk profile as the men who had high inflammation, but also went to the sauna very frequently. If you don't have access to a regular sauna, then using infrared sauna blankets is a good alternative.
