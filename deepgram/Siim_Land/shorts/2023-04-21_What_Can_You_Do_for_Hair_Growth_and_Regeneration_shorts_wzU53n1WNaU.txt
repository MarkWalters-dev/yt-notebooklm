Glutathione supplementation for reversing greys after massive stressors. Glutathione is more of an antioxidant and it's more of like a protective antioxidant. It's better as like a preventive thing. I don't think that it can directly like reverse grey hair, but for that you can still promote growth of hair with with collagen. I think protein intake and collagen, those are biggest determinants of, you know, hair growth and hair regeneration. I think that's kind of the main focus that should be. Again, like the BPC one hundred and fifty seven could help with that. Astaxanthin, vitamin c, vitamin e, maybe glycine, you can add a whole lot of like other supplements that you could take for other reasons besides the hair, but collagen and protein intake probably the main focus doubled your collagen intake and red light therapy actually can also help directly with that.
