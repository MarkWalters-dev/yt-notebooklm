Don't take melatonin gummies. Let me explain. A recent 2023 study in the journal JAMA found that eighty eight percent of tested melatonin gummies showed inaccuracies in their melatonin content. Compared to the label, the products contained anywhere from seventy four to three hundred and forty seven percent of the described dose. Melatonin is generally considered safe and with little to no adverse side effects. The problem is that melatonin in very large doses might have some negative effects on sex hormones and fertility. Melatonin in very large doses of up to seventy five milligrams is a contraceptive and we don't know the long term consequences. It's much more important to enable your body to produce its natural melatonin production. The biggest thing that stops this is artificial light exposure at night because it suppresses melatonin production.
