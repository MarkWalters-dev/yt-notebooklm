I think that the sixteen minute method is actually one of the best, methods and the best windows for doing intermittent fasting. I think it can work virtually for all people and, can give you, you know, the vast majority of results that you're looking for when you're doing intermittent fasting, whether that be body composition, productivity, or longevity and health, and those kind of things. Sixteen eight method is a great is one of the best ways of doing intermittent fasting in my opinion.
