I tried megadosing twenty eight grams of creatine a day to see how it affects my sleep during sleep deprivation. There is research that taking twenty eight grams of creatine after twenty one hours of sleep deprivation restores your cognitive function and even improves it. When I was taking twenty eight grams of creatine, I did notice an effect on my attention, focus, and processing speed, but only when I was sleep deprived. I didn't notice an effect when I slept properly. On a daily basis, you can just stick to a dose of a hundred milligrams per kilogram per day.
