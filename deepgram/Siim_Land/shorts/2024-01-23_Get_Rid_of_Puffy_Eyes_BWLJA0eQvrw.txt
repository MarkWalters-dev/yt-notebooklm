Puffy eyes can be upsetting. They make you look much worse and older than you really are. Fortunately, puffy eyes are, in most cases, temporary, and they can be prevented. Number one, get seven to eight hours of sleep per night. Not sleeping enough is a major cause of dark circles around the eyes and puffiness. If you think you sleep enough, then the issue might be sleep quality. Number two, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. They can offset the fluid balance in your body. Make sure you drink enough water as dehydration can reduce your kidney function, which then causes water retention. Number three, drinking alcohol. It dehydrates you and can make your eyes look puffy. Chronic alcohol intake will just make your eyes swell up due to the inflammation and kidney dysfunction. Number four, exercise regularly. Physical activity helps to prevent water retention and also increases the elasticity of your skin which prevents it from becoming saggy and swollen. Number five, cold exposure can help to reduce the inflammation and water retention. It stimulates the lymphatic system, which eliminates toxins from the body. Follow for more.
