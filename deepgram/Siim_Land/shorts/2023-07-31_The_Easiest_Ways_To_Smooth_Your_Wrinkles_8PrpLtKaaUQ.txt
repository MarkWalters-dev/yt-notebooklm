Regaining perfect skin is easier than you think. There is a way to remove wrinkles from the inside out. All you need to do is take care of your diet, your sleep, and take some collagen. This works because collagen has been proven to reverse skin aging. Just make sure that you get ten grams of hydrolyzed collagen peptides a day. Sleeping too little and suffering from too much stress does trigger the formation of wrinkles, so make sure that you sleep enough and reduce your stress levels. A good diet will smoothen your wrinkles from the inside out. Let's say you're eating foods that have a lot of sugar. The excess sugar is going to promote the formation of advanced glycation end products. These things will promote the breakdown of your skin collagen and promote the formation of wrinkles. But if you eat foods high on vitamin A like egg yolks, then they begin to minimize your wrinkles. Other foods that are high in vitamin A include liver and cord liver oil.
