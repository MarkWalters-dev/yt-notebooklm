Overcooking your food might be aging you faster. Let me explain. When you overcook foods like chicken, fish, or even potatoes, then you're producing these things called advanced glycation end products or AGEs. AGEs promote skin aging, wrinkles, neurodegeneration, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. So if you're overcooking your meat and it becomes more charred and crispy, then you're actually causing more damage to your collagen than you're getting it from the food. Disappointed. I know. Fried food tastes better, but it does break down your skin collagen and can promote the creation of these AGEs. Like I said, it tastes good, and small amounts of it is fine, but don't make it a staple of your everyday diet.
