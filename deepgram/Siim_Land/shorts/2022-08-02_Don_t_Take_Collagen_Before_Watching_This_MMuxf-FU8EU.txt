So collagen is not a complete protein. You don't get BCAs and you don't get all the essential amino acids from collagen. You mostly get hydroxyproline and glycine, but you don't get, like, leucine, for example, which is the key for triggering protein synthesis. If you add collagen to a whole food that has the BCAs and EAAs, maybe like eggs, steak, fish, or even whey protein, then, yeah, that's fine. But it's not gonna be the key for driving protein synthesis from the workout or the meal that you eat. So in that sense, it's not, like, necessary to build muscle. You don't need collagen to build muscle and you don't need collagen to trigger the protein synthesis. And, you know, worst of all, if you do consume only collagen alone, then that's also not enough to trigger the protein synthesis. Or adding collagen on top of an already complete protein is fine, but consuming the collagen alone is, inadequate.
