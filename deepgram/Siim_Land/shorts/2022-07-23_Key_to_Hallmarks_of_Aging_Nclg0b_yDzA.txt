Low NAD is what is causing the hallmarks of aging or promotes it. There's a reason why your NAD also decreased. So NAD itself is being recycled on a daily basis all the time. The antibody produces it from different precursors, but the main comes from this, salvage pathway that is governed by the NAEPT enzyme. So any of these being recycled all the time, and this NAEPT enzyme itself is dependent off the circadian rhythms. So you need to be aligned with the circadian rhythms in order for the salvage pathway to work and in order to recycle NAD continuously every day. The problem is that when you and you get older, the circadian hormones themselves become more dampened, and you don't produce that many of these, circadian hormones like cortisol and melatonin. That that is one part of the reason why you start to see this lack of NAD, lack of vitality, lack of repair processes.
