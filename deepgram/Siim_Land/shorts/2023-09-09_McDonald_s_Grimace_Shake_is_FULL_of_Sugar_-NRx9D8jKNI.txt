The McDonald's Grimace Shake went viral on the internet, but you might want to think twice before eating it. Always look out for the sugar amount when eating processed food. Sugar in large amounts is quite bad for your health and if you don't pay attention, you might end up eating a 100 to a 150 grams of sugar a day. This drastically increases your risk of diabetes. While the McDonald's Grimace Shake looks like a funny internet trend, what McDonald's doesn't tell you is that the shake contains 75 grams of sugar. It's recommended for adults to consume no more than 50 grams of sugar per day. The Grimace Shake surpasses that amount in one drink. Start looking into the sugar content of popular foods. You might be surprised at how much sugar you're eating on a daily basis.
