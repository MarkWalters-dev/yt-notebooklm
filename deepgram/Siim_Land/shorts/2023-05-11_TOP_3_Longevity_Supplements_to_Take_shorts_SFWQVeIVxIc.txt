These three supplements, creatine, glycine and NAC, they have supportive effects of each other. First of all, glycine supports creatine synthesis and both glycine and NAC supports glutathione synthesis. So they all work kind of synergistically. And the best of all is that they're all pretty cheap. They're very easily available and everyone can pretty much take them. With all these three supplements, you're covering pretty much all the most meaningful, most impactful aspects of aging and health span, which are the physical function, motor function, the muscle strength plus the mass, then you have the neuroprotective effects of both the glutathione and the creatine, you have immunity, you have metabolic health, all those things, body composition, and they work pretty well synergistically. And I think that they can be used as a staple for any longevity supplement
