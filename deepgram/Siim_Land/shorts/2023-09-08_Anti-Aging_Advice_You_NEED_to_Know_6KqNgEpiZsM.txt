This is the best anti aging advice you'll ever hear. Statistically, chronic diseases like heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's are the leading causes of death worldwide. So one of the first things you need to do if you want to live longer is to make sure that you don't get these chronic diseases. One of the main ways to achieve that is to not become overweight and to maintain an optimal body composition because obesity and being overweight increases the risk of all of these chronic diseases. Exercise is one of the most protective factors against obesity. Ideally, you want to do both cardiovascular exercise as well as resistance training. Now there are dozens of different diets that you could follow, but the main takeaway for longevity is that you want to maintain a moderate calorie intake. In most cases, you can achieve that by following a whole foods based diet that has minimal to no processed foods. Lastly, if you're chronically stressed out and not sleeping enough, then your body will break down at a much faster rate. So you want to aim for at least seven hours of sleep at night but optimally more like eight or even nine.
