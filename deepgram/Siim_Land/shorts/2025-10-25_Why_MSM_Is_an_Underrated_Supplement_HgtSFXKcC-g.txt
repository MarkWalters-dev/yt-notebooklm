MSM is another sulfur compound known for, joint health but it also has skin and aging benefits similar to glucosamine. So I'll put it into good tier. There's quite a few clinical trials that it does actually work. The same with chondroitin. Chondroitin has the least evidence for skin and joint health out of these two. So I'll put it into okay tier. I'll put it somewhere here before calcium alpha ketoglutarate.
