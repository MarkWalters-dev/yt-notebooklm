Here are the three best things you can do to live healthier and longer. Number one. Sauna. It's been found that sauna four times a week lowers the risk of dementia by sixty six percent, Alzheimer's risk by sixty five percent and heart disease mortality risk by sixty three percent. Number two, infrared sauna therapy. Far infrared therapy speed up wound healing and also improve heart function similar to a regular sauna. Infrared wavelengths also improve vascular function, endothelial function and increase cerebral blood flow. You can get infrared blankets that provide all the benefits of infrared light. You just wrap yourself in there for fifteen minutes at the optimal temperature of 70 to 80 degrees Celsius. Check out Boncharge for their far infrared blanket and use the code CEEAM for a 15% discount. Number three, avoid having large meals before going to bed. Your gut produces a significant amount of melatonin, which is an important hormone for sleep and longevity. Studies show that fasting before bed boosts melatonin production and early time restricted eating has been shown to improve sleep. So try out these biohacks and you'll start to look and feel better.
