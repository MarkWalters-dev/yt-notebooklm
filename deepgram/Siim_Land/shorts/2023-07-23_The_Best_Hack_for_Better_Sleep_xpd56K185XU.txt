If it's hard for you to fall asleep at night then this is for you. In the biohacking space, it's common knowledge that bright lights before bed are bad for you. But lowering your body temperature is equally as important. To effectively fall asleep, you need to lower your body temperature just a little bit. This is one of the signals for melatonin, the sleep hormone. That's because body temperature naturally lowers before sleep. Doing it preemptively sends a signal to your brain and prepares you for sleep. Now, there are three methods to achieve this. Number one. Take a warm shower or bath before going to bed. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but it's true. By taking a warm shower, you direct blood away from the core to the extremities which then lowers your core temperature. Number two. Open the window or turn on your AC. And number three is glycine which is an amino acid that lowers your body temperature and it increases GABA, the relaxation neurotransmitter. Now you know that.
