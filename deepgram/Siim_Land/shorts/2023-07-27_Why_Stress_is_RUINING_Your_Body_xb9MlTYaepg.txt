A foolproof method of improving your health is reducing psychological stress. Decreasing stress will save your skin, your diet and your brain. If you figure out ways to relax, you'll notice a difference within days. Did you know that stress can make you age faster by degrading the collagen in your skin? It also elevates cortisol levels which wears down your body much faster. Chronically elevated cortisol also makes you crave more junk food which then makes you feel much worse. If you suffer from cardiac stress, you'll begin to have sleep issues. And if you don't fix it, then it can even break down your brain. Imagine a person who is chronically stressed out and they suffer these things throughout their life. On the other hand, imagine a person who has invested into their psychological well-being. They have better sleep, better diet, better appearance, and their brain is working properly. Which one would you rather be?
