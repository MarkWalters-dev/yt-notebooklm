So naturally, humans are supposed to be diurnal, generally sleep at night and we stay awake at daytime, but that also kind of coincides with the natural production of hormones. The human body starts to produce naturally melatonin around like 9PM slowly and reaches peak at 11PM when you start to produce growth hormone as well. In the morning, your cortisol starts to rise around 6AM, peaks at 9AM. So going to bed around like nine to 11PM is, good for most people and waking up around, you know, six to 8AM, somewhere between there. Of course, there are, you know, shift work and literal night owls, but if you also want to link yourself to the day and night cycles, then, yeah, that's the optimal window to aim for.
