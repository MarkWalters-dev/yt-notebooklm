This is why your candles are toxic. Everyone likes to light a candle when the mood is right. But did you know that candles contain dangerous chemicals that could be harming your health? Many candles release trace quantities of hazardous chemicals like Toluene. If you don't ventilate properly then Toluene can give you headaches, cause dizziness and give you irritation around the eyes, nose and throat. Also, it's important to not use candles throughout the entire night because the constant exposure to carbon monoxide can have some harmful effects on your health. So what should you use instead to keep your house smelling nice? Natural essential oils and diffusers get the same job done but they don't have any harmful chemicals. Remember, the main idea is to get better alternatives so you can protect your health.
