You see people going to the gym, they all there quite frequently, but they don't see a lot of results. And, they don't see, like, a change in their body composition significantly because they do exercises that doesn't really stimulate the body or doesn't force the body to adapt in such a way that would make them build muscle and strength and bone density. So, they do either too light loads or too many reps or they have, like, you know, messed up diet.
