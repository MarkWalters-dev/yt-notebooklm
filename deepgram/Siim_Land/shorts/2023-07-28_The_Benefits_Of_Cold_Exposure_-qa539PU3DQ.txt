Want to know about the life hack that most people are afraid of? It's called cold exposure. The immediate effect of cold exposure is that it lowers your body temperature and triggers shivering thermogenesis. You're shivering and you're burning a lot of calories to keep yourself warm. That can be very powerful for fat loss. You have two kinds of fat, white fat which is kind of this blubber that maintains your calories and you have brown fat that is more for thermal regulation and keeping you warm. Brown fat also increases your metabolic rate and makes you more insulin sensitive so it's easier for you to lose weight. You can activate brown fat and convert some of the white fat into brown fat with cold exposure, intermittent fasting and physical exercise. But cold exposure is one of the fastest and most effective way to do so. There are also a lot of mental health benefits to the cold. It boosts neurotransmitters like dopamine and acetylcholine that boost your mood and your focus. I encourage you to try Cold Exposure and let me know how it works for you.
