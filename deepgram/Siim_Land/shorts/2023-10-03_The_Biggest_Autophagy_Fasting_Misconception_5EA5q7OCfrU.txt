Many people think that fasting is dangerous but it actually has a lot of health benefits. These are the biggest misconceptions about fasting and autophagy. Autophagy is important to slow down aging and promote longevity. It's basically the process of clearing out junk material inside your cells. But autavaggi also has an important role in the immune system function. While fasting is a great way to increase autavaggi, it's not the only one. Exercise increases autavaggi actually a lot more than fasting. Coffee and different teas increase autophagy. Leafy green vegetables and herbs like parsley, cruciferous vegetables and rosemary increase autophagy. Saunas and heat exposure increase autophagy. If you're nervous about fasting then try these things first. On a daily basis, to increase autophagy, you want to make sure that you're not snacking all the time, that you don't overeat calories and that you're not sedentary. Eat different kinds of colorful vegetables and add some olive oil for an extra autophagy boost.
