Omega threes are old but gold. There's decades of studies indicating that a higher omega three ratio over omega sixes is beneficial for heart health and longevity. Here's how to get your omega three ratio right. Omega sixes and threes are both essential fatty acids, but too much of omega six can promote inflammation and other health problems. Humans have consumed an omega six to three ratio of less than four to one throughout our history. Modern diets can have a ratio of up to 20 to one or even 50 to one, which is problematic. I got the results of my ratio and it was 2.7 to one, which is good. I also measured my omega three index, which measures the proportion of the omega threes, EPA, and DHA in your red blood cells. A healthy percentage is at least 8%. My results came back at nine percent. A combined intake of EBA and DHA between one point seven five to two point five grams a day has been found to be enough to reach omega three levels that are associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and death.
