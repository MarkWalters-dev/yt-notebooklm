If you drink Starbucks regularly, then you need to be careful. Did you know that a regular Starbucks coffee can contain up to 20 grams of sugar? Check out the Starbucks coffee frappuccino. You would think it contains only coffee, milk, and blended ice, but the recipe has 45 grams of sugar. That's because they use their own coffee frappuccino syrup, which contains a lot of sugar. Coffee is actually the last ingredient. A regular cappuccino also contains 12 grams of sugar from the milk. Salted caramel cream cold brew, 26 grams of sugar. Fortunately, the regular black Americano coffee contains no added sugar. The regular cold brew coffee doesn't either. However, some of the other coffee drinks like the gingerbread latte have over 30 grams of sugar. So be careful with the type of coffee you get from Starbucks because a lot of the drinks have added sugars that don't show on the menu. You have to look them up on the Starbucks menu online.
