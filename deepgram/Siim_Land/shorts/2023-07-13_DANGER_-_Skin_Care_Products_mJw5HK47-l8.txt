Of course, the foundation to good skin health is having a good diet and sleeping enough. Unfortunately, most skin care products have harmful ingredients that can actually make your skin worse. Things like parabens, sulfates and synthetic fragrances can trigger inflammation in your skin which can cause rashes and they can also disrupt your hormones. That's why a good skin care product should be made of natural ingredients because you're going to put it on your skin. The brand that I do use is Alitura Naturals. Alitura uses only natural food grade ingredients sourced and handcrafted in Hawaii. Their products contain zero fillers and zero hormone disruptors, but Alitura ingredients can help to trigger collagen synthesis in the skin and just make your skin look more radiant.
