Scrolling your phone at night might be killing you slowly. Let me explain. Artificial light exposure at night is associated with diabetes, weight gain, cancer, heart disease, and neurodegeneration. Artificial light, especially blue and green wavelengths, inhibit melatonin, the sleep hormone. Melatonin is also one of the most powerful antioxidants and anti aging hormones your body has. Scrolling your phone before bed with the blue and green light shining into your eyes shuts down melatonin production and reduces the quality of your sleep. With low melatonin, your body will begin to repair itself less and it's gonna age faster because you're under more oxygen, stress, and inflammation. Of course, you can still use your phone before going to bed, but make sure you use blue light filters like Flux or Twilight. Wearing blue blocking glasses and dimming now the lights one hour before bed is also a great way to protect your melatonin levels.
