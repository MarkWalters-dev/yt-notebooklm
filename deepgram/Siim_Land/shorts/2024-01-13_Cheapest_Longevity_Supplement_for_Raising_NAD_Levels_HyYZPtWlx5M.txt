Longevity supplements aren't cheap, especially if you're taking dozens of them every day. I'm going to share with you one of the cheapest yet most effective longevity supplement for raising NAD levels. NAD is an important enzyme in the body needed for energy and DNA repair. With age, you see a decline in NAD levels, which promotes the hallmarks of aging. The most known NAD boosters are nicotinamide riboside or n r and nicotinamide mononucleotide, NMN. However, there's one as good yet much cheaper NAD booster. It's nicotinamide or NAM. A single dose of two hundred milligrams of nicotinamide has been shown to increase NAD by 30 fold within thirty minutes with a gradual decrease until six hours. Nicotinamide supports the NAD salvage pathway, which is one of the biggest way your body makes NAD. Follow for more.
