Eating carbs in the breakfast, you've slept, your glottal receptors aren't activated. Obviously, you know, if you have worked out the day before, you're still insulin sensitive and you would still have the protein synthesis activated from that meal. But, from a timing side, then it would make more like an effective outcome if you have the carbs closer to the workout from a nutrient partitioning side. All the glucose that you consume would be more used for glycogen resynthesis and, muscle growth.
