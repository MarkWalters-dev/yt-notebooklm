Too much sitting is killing you. Let me explain. Sitting ten hours a day is linked to thirty four percent higher mortality risk in adults compared to sitting only one hour a day. Every hour of sitting increases mortality risk by two percent. Sedentary behavior increases the risk of diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Going for exercise after a long day of sitting does counteract some of the harm, but it doesn't do it completely. So definitely make sure you do exercise, but also break up your long periods of sitting with either using a standing work desk or just going for walks.
