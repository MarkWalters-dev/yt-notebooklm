I can tell you how long you will live by just doing these four simple tests at home. You can take these tests immediately after watching this video. Basically, you need to know four things about your fitness. Muscle strength, walking speed, zero to max, and how easily you can get off the floor. If a person walks very slowly, then that is a sign that they might suffer from some health condition. Ease associated with increased mortality. On the other hand, walking faster is a good sign of health and cardio respiratory fitness. VO two max is the maximum amount oxygen your body is able to consume during exercise. People with a higher VO two max have a nine percent lower risk of mortality. People with more muscle strength tend to live longer. Grip strength, quadriceps strength are the biggest predictors of overall strength. The more points of contact you need to get off the floor, the higher your risk of mortality. Imagine you're an elderly person. You're very prone to getting accidents like falling off the stairs. A good grip strength will save you in that scenario because you are able to hold onto the staircase and will allow you to find help.
