Exercise is one of the best things for your longevity and slowing down aging. Here are the four exercises you should always do to slow down aging. Number one, sprinting. Being able to sprint is a sign of youth and old people lose their ability to run with age. That's because you see a disproportionately larger loss of fast twitch muscle fibers during aging than you do with other muscle fibers. So being able to sprint is incredibly important in terms of maintaining physical fitness later in life. Number two. Back squats are mostly thought to be for power lifters but overloading your spine and hips is the most effective way of increasing the bone density in your spine and femur bone. But three, pull ups are one of the best exercises for upper body strength especially because you also have to be lower body weight. If you aim to be able to do at least 10 pull ups into your seventies, then it means you're very fit and with good body composition. And number four, hollow body holds are a gymnastics exercise but they're amazing for strengthening your core and improving stability. With a more stable core, you'll have less back pain and you're able to execute other movements more safely. Follow for more.
