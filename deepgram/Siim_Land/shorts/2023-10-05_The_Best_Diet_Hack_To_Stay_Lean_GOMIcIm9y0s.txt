You don't need to count calories to lose weight. Here's how I stay lean while still eating the foods I love. Carbs are important for building muscle, but a lot of times people might get bulkier than they would like. I stay lean even though my diet includes a lot of carbohydrates. You just want to follow some key principles when adding them to your meals. Eat carbs around your exercise to maintain the best insulin sensitivity and lowest blood sugar response. On the days that you don't exercise, reduce your carbohydrate intake and stick to mostly protein and vegetables. By just keeping the carbohydrates on your workout days, it's much easier to not gain weight. Following these tips makes it easy to stick to your diet and you can meal prep without actually counting calories.
