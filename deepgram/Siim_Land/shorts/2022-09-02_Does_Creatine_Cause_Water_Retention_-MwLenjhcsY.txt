Water definitely helps with muscle hypertrophy indirectly or it's not going to build muscle but, it does help with, like, you know, fluid accumulation in the muscle. So you wanna have water inside the muscle. You're gonna look bigger, more fuller. You'll probably perform better as well.

That's where you want to have the water, not under the skin. And that's actually one great for that.
