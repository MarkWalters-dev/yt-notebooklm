Everyone knows vegetables are good for you. Eating up to five servings of fruit and vegetables a day is associated with the lowest risk of all cause mortality. Here are the three healthiest vegetables you can eat. Number one, carrots are an amazing source of beta carotene, which is a provitamin a compound. Dietary intake and circulating levels of beta carotene are inversely associated with all cause mortality. Number two, natto is a fermented soybean dish with a lot of benefits. Dietary natto intake has been seen to contribute to reductions in cardiovascular disease mortality, as well as reduced all cause mortality. Natto is the world's highest source of vitamin k two. Vitamin k two is important for preventing artery calcification and keeping your bones strong. Number three are cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower. Higher cruciferous vegetable intake is associated with reduced risk of all cause mortality.

Gluethane is important for combating inflammation and oxidative stress, especially during aging. Follow for more.
