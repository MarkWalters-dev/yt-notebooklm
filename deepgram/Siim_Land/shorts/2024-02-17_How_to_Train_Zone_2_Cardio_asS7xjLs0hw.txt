Zone two cardio is a great form of exercise for longevity. It lays the foundation to your cardiovascular fitness, which is associated with reduced mortality. Here's how to train zone two cardio. Zone two cardio refers to the aerobic zone where you're burning the most amount of fat for fuel. Going any faster will put you into zone three where you start burning glucose for fuel. Zone two is a heart rate zone of 60 to 70% of your maximum heart rate. You can estimate your maximum heart rate by subtracting your age from 220. For me, my maximum heart rate would be a 191 beats per minute because I'm 29 years old. Then 60 to 70% of that would be a 114 to a 133 beats per minute. You can use a Polar heart rate monitor strapped around your chest to precisely know your heart rate during exercise. In practice, zone two cardio is a slightly effortful pace, but not too intense. You should be able to breathe through your nose the entire time and be able to talk on a phone. Aim for about two to three zone two cardio sessions per week, lasting forty five to fifty five minutes each session.
