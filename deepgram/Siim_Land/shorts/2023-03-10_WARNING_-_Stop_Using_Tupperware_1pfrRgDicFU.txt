Stop microwaving your food in Tupperware. Let me explain. Plastic materials are amazing for their durability and lightweightedness. However, they also contain many chemicals and microplastics that can cause hormonal disruption, infertility and other health problems. High temperature and heat mobilize these plastic compounds and they spread into your food. There are hundreds of these different plastic chemicals in plastic products such as BPA, phthalates, PCBs, flavor retardants, DEHP, and so many more. So even if your Tupperware says that it's BPA free, then it probably has something else like BPS that is equally as harmful. So if you do microwave your food or liquids, then don't use plastic Tupperware or anything that is plastic.
