Add herbs to your every meal for a massive health boost. Here's why. Reason number one: Herbs protect against glycation and lipid peroxidation. This means they help to mitigate the accumulation of these advanced glycation end products into your food that accelerate aging. They also protect against the oxidation of fats and lipids that will also be harmful for your overall health. Reason number two, herbs help with the blood sugar response and help to maintain stable blood sugar levels. Reason number three is that herbs help you to raise NAD levels which is a critical enzyme for energy production and longevity. Herbs act as CD38 inhibitors which then increase your NAD levels. Reason number four is that herbs support autophagy and lower your inflammation. Some of the best herbs that you can use are rosemary, parsley and thyme, but there are many others. So spice up your meals and reap the benefits.
