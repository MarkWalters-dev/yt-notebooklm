Struggling with craving. Here's how to beat them. Rule number one is to not have sweet stuff in the house. If you have Snickers bars and cookies laying around, then eventually you're gonna eat them. If you're the kind of person who eats the entire box of donuts after a single bite then you definitely need to avoid them in your house. The second rule is to eat enough fiber and protein with your meals. These are the most satiating food groups and they're gonna fill you up faster. Number three is apple cider vinegar. It helps to lower your blood sugar but it also helps to control your cravings. You can take some apple cider vinegar mixed with water before your meals or whenever you feel hungry. Number four, have fruit or berries instead of sweets. Fruit is relatively sweet but it's still still healthy and lower in calories than candy. Vitamins and minerals as well as fiber that are much more satiating than candy. And lastly, number five, take a hot shower or go for a walk. Exercise increases endorphins in the brain that make you feel good and reduce cravings. So, if you are.
