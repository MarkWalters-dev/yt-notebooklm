Do the hard work, especially if you don't feel like it. The reason why addictive habits are easier to stick around is because they're enjoyable and more pleasurable. You need to find what's the motivation to make your habits addictive. You have two options. You either go for the exercise or you skip it. You either eat a healthy food or you eat a cake. But let's say you skip the exercise then you're literally strengthening the pathways in your brain that make it easier for you to skip the exercise in the future. It's called neuroplasticity. Every decision you make in the present moment is going to strengthen the pathways that force your decisions in the future and you're going to repeat those same habits that you followed in the present. If you always have to use willpower to force yourself then eventually you will fail because you're gonna run out of willpower. You do need to use some discipline and willpower to guide yourself to the right path. You start to lose less discipline and less willpower because those things become habitual.
