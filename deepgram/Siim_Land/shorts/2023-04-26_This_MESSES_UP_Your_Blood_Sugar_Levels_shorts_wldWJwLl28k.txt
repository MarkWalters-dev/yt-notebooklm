You can go down the rabbit hole even more where if you consume certain foods like refined seed oils, refined carbs and sugars, if you damage the intestinal lining and you have an increase in intestinal permeability, that can lead to what's called endotoxemia, an increase in lipopolysaccharide in the blood, which can then cause central insulin, leptin resistance, as well as peripheral. But it all comes down to a lot of the same things. You're eating the bad foods. You're not eating enough of the good nutrients and the good foods. You're not active enough. You don't have enough muscle. You're not getting enough maybe sunlight and vitamin D.
