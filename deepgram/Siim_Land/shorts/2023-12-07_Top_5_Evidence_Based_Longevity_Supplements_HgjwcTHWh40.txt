Most supplements don't work. Here are the ones that do work, and they have solid evidence. Number one, creatine is most known for exercise performance, but it also has longevity benefits, especially for the brain. Number two, magnesium is the master mineral. Circulating and dietary magnesium are inversely associated with cardiovascular disease risk. Magnesium supplementation has been seen to help with sleep, insulin sensitivity, and blood pressure. Number three and four, glynac. It's the combo of glycine and NAC. Glynac has been found to improve glutathione deficiencies, lower oxidative stress, and improve mitochondrial function. It also lowers inflammation, insulin resistance, and has been shown to reverse multiple aging hallmarks. Glyac is one of the best supplements for everyone after the age of 50. That's where your gliothon levels decrease. Number five, omega threes. They have been shown to improve risk factors of cardiovascular disease and reduce cardiovascular mortality. People with the highest BOD levels of EPA and DHA haven't seem to have a lower risk of death from heart disease and Alzheimer's. Do you or take any of these supplements? Let me know in the comments.
