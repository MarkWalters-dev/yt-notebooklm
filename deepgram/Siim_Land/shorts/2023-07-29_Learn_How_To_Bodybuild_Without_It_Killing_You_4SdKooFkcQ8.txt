Are you worried that bodybuilding might be dangerous for you? Most bodybuilders die because of the same reasons. If you avoid just one thing, you can do bodybuilding without fearing for your life. This is because most bodybuilders ruin their health by doing the same mistakes, not being careful with the substances they consume to improve their performance. I'm talking about performance enhancing drugs. Steroid use dramatically increases your risk of dying by enlarging your heart. This is going to raise your blood pressure and puts more work on the heart. Steroids also have a very negative effect on your kidney function and your liver health, but other substances are just as dangerous. For example, injecting insulin could lower your blood sugar level to the point that it kills you. What about diuretics? They can make you look leaner, but diuretics can also lead to severe dehydration and thus organ failure. Taking performance enhancing drugs for bodybuilding is like having a very powerful candle. It's gonna burn brighter, but only lasts half as long.
