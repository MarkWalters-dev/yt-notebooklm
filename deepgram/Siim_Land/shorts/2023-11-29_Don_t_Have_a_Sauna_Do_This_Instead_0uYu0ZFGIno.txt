Sauna is one of the most powerful things for your longevity. Taking a sauna over four times a week compared to two to three times per week is associated with sixty three percent lower risk of sudden cardiac death, sixty three percent reduced heart disease mortality, and forty percent reduced all cause mortality. If you don't have access to a sauna, then you can still gain those benefits by exercising. Exercise is going to elevate your body temperature that mimics a lot of the benefits of sauna. There is also infrared sauna blanket therapy originating from Japan called Weiyon therapy. It's been shown to improve cardiac function and reduce cardiac events in patients with heart failure. The infrared sauna blanket is significantly cheaper than the regular infrared sauna and the traditional sauna, but it has very similar health benefits because it increases your body temperature. The best sauna blanket that has the specific wavelengths of light with benefits is by Bon Charge. It warms up super fast only in two minutes.
