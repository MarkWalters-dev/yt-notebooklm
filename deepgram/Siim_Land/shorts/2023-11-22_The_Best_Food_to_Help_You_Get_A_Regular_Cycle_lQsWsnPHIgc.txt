If you're struggling with digestion, these are the five best foods to help you get a regular cycle. Number one. Mineral water. Minerals and salt are essential for gastrointestinal motility. Several studies have shown that mineral water helps with constipation and indigestion. Number two. Coffee. Having a cup of coffee stimulates the gut in a way that helps you to poop. The caffeine also stimulates the muscles of the colon. Number three. Beans and lentils. Both are high in soluble and insoluble fiber that feed the gut microbiome. This then improves your motility. Number four. Apples. An apple a day keeps the doctor away and it applies here too. Apples contain pectin, a compound that improves blood sugar and your lipids but it also feeds the microbiome. Number five. Psyllium husk. Psyllium contains a lot of fiber and it also adds bulk to your stool. If you have constipation or stomach issues then try adding these foods to see if it improves your stool frequency.
