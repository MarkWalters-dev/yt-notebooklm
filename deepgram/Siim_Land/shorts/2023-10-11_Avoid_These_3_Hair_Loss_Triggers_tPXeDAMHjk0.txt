Avoid these three hair loss triggers. These three everyday habits are destroying your hair and they could be triggering your hair loss. Luckily, they're all easily avoidable. Number one, ultra processed foods. Processed foods can lead to dandruff production which stops hair growth and regrowth. Cutting out processed foods will also protect against obesity and insulin resistance, both of which can promote hair loss. Number two, refined carbohydrates. Keeping a diet of balanced carbohydrates will keep your thyroid healthy. Especially, too many refined carbohydrates can be problematic in terms of hair loss. But being too low carb for too long can also lead to hair loss and hair thinning because of low thyroid functioning. Number three is stress. I'm pretty sure everyone has experienced some hair loss from being too stressed out. Reducing stress and making sure you get enough sleep is one of the best ways to ensure that your hair doesn't fall out. By removing these factors from your life or minimizing them, you can stop hair thinning and make sure that you don't fall out.
