Collagen peptides have been repeatedly shown to reverse hallmarks of skin aging in humans. A 2023 meta analysis of 26 randomized controlled trials showed that hydrolyzed collagen peptide supplementation significantly improved skin hydration and elasticity. Your skin collagen content starts decreasing already in your twenties by about 10% per decade. So if you were to start taking collagen in your forties and fifties, it's going to be hard to catch up. However, collagen has many other health benefits beyond skin health. Another 2023 meta analysis of randomized controlled trials found that collagen peptides improve cardiometabolic risk factors such as LDL, systolic blood pressure and fat mass. That's why I'm taking ten grams of collagen peptides every day. Brand of collagen I take, Nordcode, has extra five grams of glycine. Their collagen contains five different types of collagen from both bovine and marine sources. So I'll be getting ten grams of collagen peptides plus five grams more glycine.
