Plastics are everywhere in our society. The water, personal care products, food and even the air you breathe. What's worse, these microplastics accumulate in your body, in your arteries, testicles and even the brain. You don't have to be super scared of old plastics because you can't avoid them completely. But, you should make some easy swaps to reduce the burden of microplastics on your body. Number one, plastic cutting boards. Every time you cut into it with a knife, you're releasing millions of microplastics into your food. Use a wooden or stainless steel board. Number two. Tupperware leaches microplastics into your food especially if you heat it up. Swap for glass and stainless steel containers. Number three. Teflon pans leach billions of microplastics into your food. Get stainless steel frying pans. Number four, plastic utensils like spatulas. Wood and steel spatulas instead. Number five, plastic tea bags leach microplastics into your tea when they're boiled. Choose loose leaf tea or cotton tea bags. Number six, Coffee pods get heated and thus leach microplastics into your coffee. Use paper filter coffee or French press. Number seven. Plastic bottles and tin cans. Instead, use glass bottles or paper cartons. Number eight. Polyester underwear robs microplastics into your private parts. Use cotton underwear instead. Number nine. Bleached toilet paper is full of hormone disruptors. Pick uncolored toilet paper that looks kind of yellow or gray. It's cheaper and without the bleach. Number 10. Take away cups and leads get heated and leach microplastics. Get a reusable thermos or stainless steel cup. These are just small steps that you can take towards living life with less microplastics in your body. Follow for more.
