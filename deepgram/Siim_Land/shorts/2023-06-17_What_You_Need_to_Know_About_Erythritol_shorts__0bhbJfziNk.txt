Does erythritol, the common artificial sweetener, cause heart disease? Artificial sweetener, erythritol, and cardiovascular event risk. Basically, what they found, a lot of plasma levels of erythritol were associated cardiovascular disease events. However, your body also produces erythritol naturally endogenously through the pentose phosphate pathway. The pentose phosphate pathway has also been found to be involved in diabetes and cancer. This association study didn't prove that erythritol causes heart disease. What it did tell you was that high blood erythritol levels are associated with getting cardiovascular disease events. But the reason why the blood erythritol levels are high isn't because of consuming erythritol, it's probably due to some aspects of already existing insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease through the pentosulcet pathway.
