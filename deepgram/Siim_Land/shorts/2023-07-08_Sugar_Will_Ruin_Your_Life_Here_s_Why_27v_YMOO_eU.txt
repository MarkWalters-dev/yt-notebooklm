Sugar can completely ruin your life. Here's why. It's normal for your blood sugar levels to rise after eating, but eventually it has to come down. However, chronically elevated blood sugar levels can cause a lot of health problems. One of the biggest results of chronically elevated blood sugar is atherosclerosis. Your arteries will become thickened or hardened which then leads to a build up of plaque. The top three issues people with atherosclerosis will face are heart disease, erectile dysfunction and neurodegeneration. So before you load up with sweets, think about how.
