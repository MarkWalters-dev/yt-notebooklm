The top three mistakes people make when starting to take supplements. Make sure you avoid these three common mistakes. Taking a random multivitamin, not having a good diet and taking the new hottest longevity supplement. Let me explain. Most multivitamins contain random amounts of vitamins and minerals. You might be getting too much of some vitamins and not enough of the others. Whether or not you need certain vitamins and minerals depends on your blood work. But if you're just taking a random multivitamin, you might not address your deficiencies. If you don't have a good diet you might be taking supplements for things that you could get from your diet. So at that point you're just wasting your money. There are some nutrients that you want to get from your diet. For example, supplementing iron and calcium has been found to increase the risk of heart disease. Lastly, we have longevity supplements which are all very experimental and new. So before you start taking the newest, trendiest longevity supplement, make sure that it actually has research to back it up. Taking supplements while making these mistakes is like throwing your money and your health down the drain.
