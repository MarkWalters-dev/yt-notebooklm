The reason I stopped doing the sixteen minute method around five years ago when I switched over to one meal a day didn't have anything to do with the sixteen minute method in of itself. It still worked. It still gave me great results. I could have kept going. But the reason I switched over to eating one meal a day was because of mostly like time management. Like back then, I was actually first starting this YouTube channel and first starting my blog and everything related to starting to write books and all those things. So I had to have like a lot more time in a sense. I was like really working hard and working long hours every day. Basically, I was working from the moment I woke up until the moment I went to bed. It made sense for me to even skip the second meal that I was having. And I was switched over to just eating one meal.
