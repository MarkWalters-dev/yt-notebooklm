Do you have any advice on how to look after your mental health as you age? Maintaining good mental health is crucial for living a fulfilling life. The easiest way to do this is to make sure you're physically active. Physical activity has major benefits on the brain and mental health. A 2023 study found that muscle strength was associated with better cognitive function in the elderly people. Elderly people who aren't physically active are much more likely to develop dementia after the age of 60. Improvement in muscle strength also improves the connections between brain cells. Weight training has also been found to protect the hippocampus which reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease. So make sure you are working out to stay mentally young.
