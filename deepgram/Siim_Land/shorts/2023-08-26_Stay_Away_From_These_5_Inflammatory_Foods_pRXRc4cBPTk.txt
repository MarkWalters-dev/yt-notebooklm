What you eat might be causing inflammation. Avoiding these five foods will help you to feel less tired, reduce joint pain, and lose water rate. Number one, beyond meat. It contains a lot of canola oil. Canola oil is very high in omega six fannyasis that cause inflammation inside your body. Number two, processed meat like hot dogs and burgers have a lot of nitrates and trans fats which do increase inflammation and make you retain more water because of the high amount of salt. Number three is french fries. Almost all french fries are cooked in canola oil which is high in omega six fatty acids that increase inflammation. Number four is fried chicken. Fried chicken like KFC is fried in canola oil. You cause more oxidation to the canola oil making the KFC actually more inflammatory. And number five is Ben and Jerry's. Very high in sugar and fat at the same time. This makes it very easy for you to gain weight if you eat too much. Being inflamed causes joint pain and constant tiredness. By avoiding these foods, the quality of your life will improve.
