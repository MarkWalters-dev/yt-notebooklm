Why you should stop drinking tap water? Tap water is a cheaper alternative to bottled water, but is it worth your help? Tap water contains a small amount of fluoride that helps to prevent tooth decay in the general population. However, if not regulated, high amounts of fluoride can damage the brain and nerves. It's especially dangerous for children in their developmental ages as fluoride has been seen to lower IQ. Fluoride can also be harmful for your thyroid, which can make you gain weight. But fluoride isn't the only thing inside your tap water, because tap water is a recycle that water debose. It contains residual medication and birth control, so the least you can and should do is use water filtration to make sure that you're not putting harmful chemicals and ingredients into your body. For the most efficient filtration, I recommend using a Berkeley water filter or reverse osmosis water filter.
