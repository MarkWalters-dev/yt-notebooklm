Here's what fitness experts don't tell you about losing fat. Adding walking to your exercise routine is the easiest and quickest way to lose some fat. It sounds crazy, but it's true. Walking is a low intensity physical activity where your body is mostly burning fat. If you you walk, jog or do something else that is low intensity, you stay in the fat burning zone a lot longer. Walking also increases your total daily energy expenditure which reflects how many calories your body is burning every day. This helps you to create a calorie deficit which is crucial for losing fat because you don't wanna just burn fat. You also want to lose it. Aim for 10 to 12,000 steps a day for your overall health. But if you want to really step it up a notch, then do 15,000 steps. The best part is that you don't need a gym. You can walk anywhere and it will improve your health.
