Chromium is hugely underrated. Just like thiamine, a lot of things can cause chromium deficiency. We lose it in sweat. When we consume carbohydrates, it releases chromium in the cell to handle that carb, and then we lose that chromium in the urine. And then exercise increases your requirements of chromium as well. What's really bad is that the bioavailability of chromium is only 1%. So when you lose it, you have to get a 100 fold intake to replace that 1% back.
