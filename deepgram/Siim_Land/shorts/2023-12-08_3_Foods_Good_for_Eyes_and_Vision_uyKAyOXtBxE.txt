Nobody wants to lose their eyesight with age. Unfortunately, there's a natural decline in the sharpness of your vision. Here are the top five foods good for your eyes. Number one, eggs. They're an amazing source of lutein and zeaxanthin. These are important antioxidants that protect your eyes. A 2020 study found that consuming two to four eggs per week compared to less than once a week was associated with a significantly lower chance of age related macular degeneration over a fifteen year period. Number two, fatty fish like salmon or sardines. These fish contains zeaxanthin, but they also have omega three fats that are important for the brain and eyes. Your eyes are literally an extension of your brain. Higher dietary intake of omega three fats has been linked to lower rates of macular degeneration. Number three, anthocyanins. They're another type of antioxidant found in blueberries, blackberries, purple cabbage, grapes, and other dark colored plant foods. Anthocyanins have been shown to enhance night vision and protect the eyes against oxidative stress. Add these boost to regular diet and keep your vision healthy.
