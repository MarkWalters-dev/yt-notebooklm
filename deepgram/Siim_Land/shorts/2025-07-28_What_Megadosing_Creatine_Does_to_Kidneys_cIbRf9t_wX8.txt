When I mega dose twenty eight grams of creatine a day, I noticed improved cognition after sleep deprivation but not when I was sleeping normally. One of the major comments and concerns people had was, isn't it bad for your kidneys? Rip kidneys. Well, my kidney markers like creatinine, eGFR and cystatin c were normal before and after taking creatine. Creatine might raise creatinine levels which is a marker of kidney function but the creatinine can also raise because of muscle mass. So unless you have kidney disease, you don't have to worry about creatine being bad for your kidneys.
