Does looking at your phone really affect your sleep? Yes. Checking your phone immediately before bed is bad for your sleep, but it's not what you think. Most people think it's the blue light from the screen that is bad for the sleep. Yes. Blue light does affect the sleep negatively by suppressing melatonin production. But a recent study showed something that is more important. The study had two groups of people use their phones before bed. In one of the groups, people stared at at the bright screen. The other group stared at the phone while using the blue blocking glasses. The crazy part is that both groups saw a negative effect on their sleep. So the problem isn't necessarily the light, It's what you do with your phone. Working and using social media on your phone is active and stimulating for the brain that keeps you awake. So if you're looking to build better sleep habits, you want to save the scrolling for later.
