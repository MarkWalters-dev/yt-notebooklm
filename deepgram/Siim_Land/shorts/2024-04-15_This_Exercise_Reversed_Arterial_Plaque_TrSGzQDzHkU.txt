Arterial plaque is one of the main characteristics of heart disease. There's no established method of reversing plaque from the arteries. However, a recent 2022 study found that this particular exercise did reduce plaque. They took thirty patients with stable coronary artery disease. The patients were told to do six months of supervised high intensity interval training on a treadmill. After six months, their plaque build up reduced from 49.5% to 48.3%. That's a decrease of 1.2% which doesn't sound like quite a lot. However, trials with lipid lowering drugs find that every 1% reduction in average plaque size gives a twenty to twenty five percent decrease in the risk of cardiovascular disease events. So what did their HIIT workout look like? The workout protocol consisted of a ten minute warm up at 60 to 70 of maximum heart rate, followed by four minutes of running at 85 to 95% of max heart rate, followed by three minutes of running at 60 to 70%, repeated for four rounds and ended with a five minute cooldown.
