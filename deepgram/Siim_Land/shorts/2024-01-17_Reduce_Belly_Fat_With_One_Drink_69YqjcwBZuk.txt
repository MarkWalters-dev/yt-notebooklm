Having a round belly is a sign of visceral fat. Visceral fat is this internal fat around the organs, specifically around the liver. There are many things that can cause visceral fat accumulation, but fortunately, there are ways to decrease it. First, you have to reduce the amount of triglycerides in your blood because high triglycerides promote liver fat storage. Triglycerides rise in most cases because of high blood sugar and insulin resistance. One of the easiest ways to reduce triglycerides and blood sugar is with apple cider vinegar. In type two diabetics, apple cider vinegar ingestion can improve whole body insulin sensitivity by nineteen percent and by thirty four percent in subjects with insulin resistance compared to placebo. Taking either fifteen milliliters or thirty milliliters of apple vinegar a day for twelve weeks has been shown to significantly reduce visceral fat, waist circumference, and triglycerides compared to placebo. The benefits of apple cider vinegar come from its acetic acid content. To get the required amount of acetic acid, you need to dilute one to two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in a cup of eight ounces of water. Follow for more.
