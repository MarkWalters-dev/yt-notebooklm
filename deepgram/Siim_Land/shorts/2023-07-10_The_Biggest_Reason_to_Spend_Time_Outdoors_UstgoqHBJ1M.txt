Stop scrolling, go outside and play. The circadian rhythms, the day and night cycles, and bright light exposure can greatly boost your mood, your energy levels, and overall well-being. They increase different neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin as well that make you feel good. Dopamine is often called the reward neurotransmitter, but it actually makes you more goal seeking, more driven, and motivated. Serotonin is more like a calm and grounding neurotransmitter. When you're outdoors, you get these benefits from the light exposure and the environmental exposure. Spending time outdoors is associated with mental health benefits as well as longevity. Gardening especially is linked to better health and living longer. Some of the benefits of gardening may also come from grounding because of touching the ground.
