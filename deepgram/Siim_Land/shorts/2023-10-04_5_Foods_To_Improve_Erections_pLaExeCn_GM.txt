You don't need Viagra to help with erections. All you need to do is include these five foods into your diet. Number one. Beetroots. Beets help to promote nitric oxide which improves blood flow and vasodilation into the penis. Number two are oysters. Oysters are very high in zinc and other minerals that boost testosterone levels and improve sperm production. Number three watermelon. Watermelon is very high in citrulline which is an amino acid that improves blood flow. Number four salmon. Salmon is full of healthy omega-three fatty acids that help to prevent plaque buildup inside the blood vessels of the penis. And number five is herring. Herring has very similar benefits as salmon. It has vitamin d, healthy omega three fatty acids and it's full of minerals that improve testosterone production. You should also reduce your alcohol consumption because alcohol increases estrogen and lowers testosterone. Alcohol promotes erectile dysfunction and reduces the quality of erections. If you improve your diet and avoid certain products, you can improve the quality of your erections.
