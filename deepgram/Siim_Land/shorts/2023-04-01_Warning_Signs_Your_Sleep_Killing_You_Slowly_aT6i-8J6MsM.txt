Do you often feel tired after waking up? If yes, then your sleep might be killing you slowly. Let me explain. Seventy five percent of sleep disorder breathing cases stay undiagnosed. You could be having severe sleep apnea every night for years without knowing it. That's literally killing you slowly in your sleep by raising the blood pressure, causing insulin resistance, and just promoting cardiovascular disease. Sleep apnea is a sleep breathing disorder where you periodically stop breathing in your sleep. Those pauses can last from a few seconds to several minutes. If you have these symptoms, tired after waking up, dry mouth in the morning, you have a thick neck or you're overweight, you're told that you snore at night, you have either high blood pressure or high blood sugar levels, then I think it's very worthwhile for you to get checked for any kind of sleep disorder breathing.
