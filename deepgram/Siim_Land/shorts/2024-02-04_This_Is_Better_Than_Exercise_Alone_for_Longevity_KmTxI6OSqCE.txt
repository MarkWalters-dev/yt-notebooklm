Exercise is probably one of the best things for your longevity. Regular exercise extends your life expectancy by up to six point nine years. But there's one thing that mimics a lot of the benefits of exercise and can have additional benefits. The one thing I'm talking about is sauna. Regular sauna use over four times a week is associated with sixty three percent lower risk of heart disease mortality and forty percent lower all cause mortality. A lot of the benefits of the sauna come from increasing your body temperature and increasing your heart rate similar to exercise. However, a 2022 randomized controlled trial saw that doing the sauna combined with exercise gave better results in terms of blood pressure, cholesterol, and card respiratory fitness, so exercising and doing the sauna together is better than just exercising alone. Infrared saunas are amazing if you don't have access to a regular sauna. Infrared sauna blankets are even more compact and convenient.
