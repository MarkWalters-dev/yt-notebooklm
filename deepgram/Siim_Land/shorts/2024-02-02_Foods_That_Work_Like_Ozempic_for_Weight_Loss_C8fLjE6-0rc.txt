Ozempic and semaglutide are prescribed for obesity and type two diabetes. However, many celebrities have started to take it off label to lose a few pounds. If you're not prescribed Ozempic, then you can use natural foods that have similar effects. Ozempic is a GLP one receptor agonist, which means it increases GLP one expression that lowers blood sugar and promotes appetite. A 2020 meta analysis showed that eating thirty five grams of protein increases GLP one expression and reduces appetite, whereas doses of less than thirty five grams don't have those effects. So every time you eat, make sure you get at least 35 grams of protein. Dietary flavonoids and phytochemicals such as quercetin and fisetin have been shown to directly stimulate GLP one expression as well. You get flavonoids from colorful plant foods such as red onions, strawberries, and vegetables. Losing weight comes down to regulating your appetite and reducing energy intake.
