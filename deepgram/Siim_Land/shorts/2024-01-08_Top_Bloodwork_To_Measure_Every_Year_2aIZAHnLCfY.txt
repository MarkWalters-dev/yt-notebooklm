Preventing chronic diseases comes down to staying healthy year after year. Here are the top biomarkers I measure annually for my longevity. Hemoglobin a one c and fasting insulin. These reflect your insulin desistivity and risk of diabetes. Lipid panel, which includes cholesterol and triglycerides. These are relevant for heart disease and metabolic syndrome. Apo b is a lipoprotein that's the most associated with atherosclerosis, so this is more important than regular cholesterol. Highly sensitive CRP. This is a marker of inflammation. Inflammation promotes all chronic diseases and is associated with higher mortality. The lower CRP, the better. Liver enzymes like ALT, AST, Gg, and ALP for liver health. Complete blood count, like white blood cells and red blood cells for immunity. Vitamin d because I live in a place with not a lot of sun. This is not a comprehensive list, but it includes the most important ones. If you want to join me at my retreat in India for measuring a 180 biomarkers, fitness tests, heart scans, liver scans, full body MRI and a lot more, then check out the link in the description.
