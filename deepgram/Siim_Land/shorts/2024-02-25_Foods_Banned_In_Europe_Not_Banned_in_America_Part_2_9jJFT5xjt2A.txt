There are a lot of foods in America that are banned in Europe and other countries. Number four, meat with ractopamine. In The US, factory farms use ractopamine, which is added to the feed of livestock to promote their growth. Meat with ractopamine was banned in The EU in 2014. They did it because of fear of uncertainty about its effects on humans. Ractopamine causes beta adrenergic stimulation, which could be harmful to children and people with cardiovascular disease by causing elevated heart rate. Different growth hormones in meat are also banned in Europe. Number five, citrus flavored soft drinks that have brominated vegetable oil. In The US, you can find this ingredient in Mountain Dew, but not in Europe's Mountain Dew. It contains bromine, which can potentially lead to memory loss and skin and nerve problems. As you can see, different unions, different rules. Now if you eat these foods every once in a while, then it's probably not gonna be an issue, but it's probably not the smartest to eat these every day. Follow for more.
