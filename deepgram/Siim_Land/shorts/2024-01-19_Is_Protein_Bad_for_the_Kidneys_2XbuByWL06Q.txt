High protein diets appear to always do better for weight loss than low protein diets. But isn't too much protein bad for the kidneys? Yes. A higher protein intake in people with diabetes or kidney damage is linked to higher risk of developing kidney disease. However, there's no evidence that a high protein diet would cause kidney disease in otherwise healthy people. A 2019 review found no association between protein intake and long term decline in kidney function among people with normal kidney function. However, there was a link among people with below normal kidney function. Mechanistically speaking, a higher protein intake could eventually lead to a decline in kidney function by causing hyperfiltration. That's why it's more important to actually monitor your kidney health with things like e g f r, creatinine, cystatin c, and blood urea nitrogen. Whether or not you need to reduce your protein intake would have to depend on those markers. Follow for more.
