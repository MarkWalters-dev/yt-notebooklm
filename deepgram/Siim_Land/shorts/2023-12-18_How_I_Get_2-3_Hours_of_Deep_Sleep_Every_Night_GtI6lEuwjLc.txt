Every night, I get two to three hours of deep sleep, which is quite a lot. Deep sleep is absolutely critical for repairing the body and recovering from daily activities. Here's what I do for getting more deep sleep. Number one, going to bed around the same time and trains your body's circadian rhythms that control sleep wake on the cycles. You get the most deep sleep in the earlier part of the night, so staying consistent has been shown to improve sleep onset and quality. Number two, the biggest thing that contributes to decreased sleep quality and deep sleep especially is artificial light exposure at night. It suppresses melatonin, the sleep hormone. To minimize the bright light exposure, I start wearing blue light blocking glasses one hour before bed. A 2021 systematic review found that wearing blue blocking glasses helps with sleep onset in patients with sleep disorders, jet lag, or shift work. The brand of blue blockers I use, Bond Charge, has lenses that specifically filter out the wavelengths of light that inhibit melatonin. They also have red light light bulbs that emit no blue or green light. Head over to bondcharge.com/seamlund, and use the code steam for a 15% discount.
