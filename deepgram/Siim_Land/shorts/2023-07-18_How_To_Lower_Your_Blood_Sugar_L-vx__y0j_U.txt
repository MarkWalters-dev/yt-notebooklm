A walk might save your life. It's been found that every hour of sitting increases mortality risk by two percent. One of the best ways to lower your blood sugar levels is to be more physically active. Physical activity makes your body soak up the glucose from your bloodstream and increases your insulin sensitivity. You want to aim for at least a hundred and fifty minutes of moderate physical activity per week or in most cases, it's gonna be around thirty minutes per day. You don't have to do some very intense exercise to reap the benefits of lowering your blood sugar levels. Even a simple walk can make a huge difference. Walking about three to four hours a week is linked to a fifty four percent lower mortality risk. One of the most important times to go for a walk is after a meal because your blood sugar levels have risen. The walking will drastically lower your blood sugar levels and you'll be back to a normal blood sugar level faster. So it doesn't matter whether you do a full body intense workout or you just go for a simple walk. The main point is that getting up, staying more physically active will lead to a healthier and longer life.
