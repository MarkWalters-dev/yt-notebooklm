Inflammation is one of the main drivers of aging and chronic diseases. With age you also see an increase in inflammation which is called inflammaging. For overall health and longevity, you want to keep your inflammation as low as possible. Here's how to lower inflammation. Number one, the first thing is is to lose excess body fat. Body fat, especially visceral fat around the organs, is continuously secreting pro inflammatory cytokines into your blood that cause inflammation. Number two, weight loss and calorie restriction have both been shown to lower markers of inflammation and slow down aging. Number three, some supplements that have been shown to lower inflammation include astaxanthin, curcumin, vitamin c, magnesium, melatonin, glycine, and n a c. Number four, glycine and n a c increase your body's gluathione levels, which is a powerful antioxidant. Inflammation is mostly driven by the age related decrease in gluathione levels. There are many human clinical trials showing that glycine and n a c reduce inflammation and other markers of aging. And number five, from a dietary standpoint, then polyphenol rich foods such as vegetables, berries, olive oil as well as omega threes from fish and seafood have been shown to lower inflammation.
