Yeah. You do need to exert your body at a near maximum effort to facilitate muscle strength or muscle hypertrophy and the bone density as well. And if people do if you do reps, that's like 20 reps or 15 reps, then you're starting to actually train a bit more endurance, not the muscle strength and muscle size. And, the optimal ranges generally for muscle strength and muscle growth are like five reps up until 12 reps, somewhere between there. And I generally don't ever train above 12 reps. Maybe like a few exercises or cool down sets I do, like 12 or 15 reps, but most of the time I'll stay between even like three to 10 reps, somewhere between there.
