Natural ways to boost your skin's collagen. Here are three ways you can boost your skin's collagen. Number one, collagen peptides. Many studies have found that collagen peptides help to reverse hallmarks of skin aging, improve skin hydration and skin elasticity. Number two is glycine. One third of collagen is made of glycine. Glycine directly supports collagen turnover and it has other antiaging benefits such as reduction in inflammation and reduction in advanced glycation end products that break down your skin collagen. Number three infrared light. Infrared light also promotes blood flow and increases energy production in the skin cells. There are also many other natural compounds like alfalfa, spirulina, ashwagandha, turmeric, colostrum and honey that can also have positive effects on your skin. The best skin care product that I use and I've found is the Gold Serum by Allatura Naturals. It contains only natural food grade ingredients that support collagen synthesis in the skin.
