One of the most popular social media trends is taking the ice bath. There are indeed some benefits to cold water exposure such as lower inflammation, stronger immune system, fat burning, increased alertness, and mood regulation. But how do ice baths compare to saunas? Saunas have a lot more evidence for health benefits than cold exposure. The effects are also a lot more powerful in terms of longevity. Using the sauna over four times a week compared to two to three times is linked with a sixty three percent lower risk of heart disease mortality and forty percent reduced all cause mortality. There's no study on cold water exposure reducing the risk of these chronic diseases. So while I think that most people don't need to do cold exposure, I do think that most people would benefit from regular sauna use. I'm using the sauna four times a week. The bond charge infrared sauna blanket makes it super simple. It heats up to the right temperature of 70 degrees Celsius shown in research to give the benefits, and it does it in less than five minutes. Easy to pack under your bed and low EMF.
