How to properly wash vegetables. I noticed a serious issue. People don't know how to wash their vegetables properly. Here's why it's important. If you don't wash your vegetables you're gonna miss all the pesticides, dirt, insects hiding in your food. First soak your vegetables in salt water with vinegar. The salt will dehydrate and kill all the bacteria on the food. The vinegar can help to remove pesticides and other chemicals. Then leave them in a bowl with a mix for about two to three minutes. After that rinse them in a a bowl with clean water. You should also wash your apples if you buy them from the store. They're usually covered in wax. Soak the apples in a mix of baking soda and vinegar for about ten minutes. This is gonna remove the wax and you can actually see it later in the water. Fruit and vegetables are incredibly important for your health, but you still want to protect yourself from ingesting the wrong thing by learning how to wash them properly.
