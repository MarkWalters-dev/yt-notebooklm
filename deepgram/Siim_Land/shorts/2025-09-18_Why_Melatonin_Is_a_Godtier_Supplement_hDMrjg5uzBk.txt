Melatonin gut here. So I'm a huge fan of melatonin, not for its sleep benefits. Obviously, the sleep benefits are true that it helps with sleep, increases sleep quality and sleep duration. But, I'm personally mostly interested in it because of the antioxidant benefits. So melatonin helps with, glutathione regulation, autophagy regulation in your sleep, and it's a powerful antioxidant. So I take pretty large dose melatonin a few times a month, like ten milligrams, just for these antioxidant benefits.
