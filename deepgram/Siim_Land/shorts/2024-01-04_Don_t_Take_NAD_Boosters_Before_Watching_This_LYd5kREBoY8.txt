NAD boosters are thought to have longevity benefits. The reason is said to be by raising NAD, which is an enzyme that goes down with age. However, NAD boosters don't fix the root cause of why NAD goes down. NAD boosters raise NAD, but they don't support the NAD recycling. For your body to recycle NAD, it needs to have an enzyme called NAMPT active. However, NAMPT is dependent of circadian alignment. Having misaligned circadian rhythms suppresses NAD recycling. The main circadian rhythm is the cortisol melatonin rhythm. You basically want to get exposed to bright lights in the morning and avoid artificial light exposure at night. Blue light from smartphones and lamps disrupts your circadian rhythms. That's why wearing blue blocking glasses not only helps with sleep, but also with keeping your circadian rhythms aligned.
