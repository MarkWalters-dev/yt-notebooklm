Best five things to prioritize to lose 35 pounds as quickly as possible and sustain it. Obviously, you need to be in a calorie deficit to eat, like, lean proteins and vegetables. That's kind of the best. Then secondly, you will do, you know, resistance training to build lean muscle tissue and make you very insulin sensitive. Third would be to you know manage your stress and sleep well because then by default you will you know make better decisions. Number four would be to kind of have like another purpose but yeah, like some things to do other than eating because a lot of times people eat because they're bored. And lastly, I would say cardio or walking. I think that's also very underrated.
