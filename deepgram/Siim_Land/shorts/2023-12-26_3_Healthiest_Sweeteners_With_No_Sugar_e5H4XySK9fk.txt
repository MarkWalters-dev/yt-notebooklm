All artificial sweeteners are healthier than regular sugar. Here's a list of three healthier sweeteners that have no sugar. Number one, glycine is an amino acid that helps with collagen synthesis, antioxidant defense, and sleep quality. Glycine doesn't have any sugar, but it still tastes quite sweet. Glycine actually lowers blood sugar and can protect against the formation of advanced glycation in products that cause skin aging. If you take glycine before bed, it can improve sleep quality by lowering body temperature and increasing the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Number two, inositol. Inositol is something your body synthesizes from glucose, which is why it also tastes sweet. Supplementing with inositol has been found to have insulin sensitizing effects. Number three, stevia is extracted from the leaves of the plant called stevia rebaudiana. Stevia can be 250 to 300 times sweeter than table sugar. Stevia consumption has been shown to modestly reduce blood pressure and blood sugar levels. If you want to sweeten your teas or coffee or some desserts, then use these sweeteners.
