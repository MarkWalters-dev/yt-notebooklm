You don't have to cut out entire meals to lower your blood sugar. You just have to reorganize them. Eating salad before rice has been proven to lower your blood sugar response. When planning your meals, don't eat the high carbohydrate foods first. If you eat bread, juice or potatoes the first thing in your meal then it's going to cause a much larger spike in your blood sugar levels. But if you eat protein and fiber first, it's actually going to lower your blood sugar response. So whenever you are any carbohydrates, make sure you eat salad first. You can also improve the glycemic response by adding apple cider vinegar or olive oil to your meal. These foods have been shown to lower the glucose response to your meals. To avoid diabetes, you want to have your morning blood sugar levels below a 100 milligrams per deciliter. Taking the extra time to structure your meals accordingly will help you keep your blood sugar levels normal.
