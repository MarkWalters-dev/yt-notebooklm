Creatine is one of the oldest and most researched supplements in the world. It has many proven benefits for muscle strength, muscle performance, and muscle mass. However, creatine also has many anti aging and longevity benefits such as neuroprotection, methylation support. Obviously, the muscle mass and muscle strength are also quite vital for healthy aging. When you're older then your creatinine levels decrease, your muscle mass decreases which is a huge risk factor for mortality and hip fractures and immobility and all those things. You don't want to lose your mobility. You don't want to lose your muscle strength and muscle mass with age. Those are quite critical. One of the biggest predictors of longevity and mortality is your muscle mass. And creatine, just by increasing your body's phosphocreatine stores and improving muscle strength, is a longevity supplement from that side. And from the neurological side or the brain side, creatine protects against brain aging and it just improves cognition as well.
