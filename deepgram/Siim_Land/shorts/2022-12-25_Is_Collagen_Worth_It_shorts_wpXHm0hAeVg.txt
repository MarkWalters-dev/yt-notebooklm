A lot of people don't believe that collagen is beneficial because our own cells can synthesize collagen and accurately think that there's no benefit to actually taking exogenous sources of collagen or glycine because our body can make each. But the problem with that is the fact that in order for our cells to actually make collagen, they need to have certain amino acid precursors to do that. And you really don't get high amounts of those in the diet. So by taking a collagen supplement, you're getting more of the building blocks that your body needs to synthesize collagen. So in other words, 100% studies have shown that supplementing with collagen increases your own endogenous collagen synthesis, the thickness of tendons and ligaments, the strength of those, the improvements in skin health obviously as well. So there's numerous randomized studies in humans showing that collagen can benefit anywhere from bone health, blood pressure, even muscle mass and strength.
