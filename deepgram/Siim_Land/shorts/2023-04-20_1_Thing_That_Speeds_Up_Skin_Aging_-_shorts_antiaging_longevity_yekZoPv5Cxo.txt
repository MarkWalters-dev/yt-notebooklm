So glucose. Glucose is virtual. We know that glucose is sticky on the outside. It's sticky on the inside, so it sticks to all of your structures, proteins, DNA, lipids, etcetera. Form something called AGEs, which are advanced glycation end products. Several things about AGEs. Number one, it takes the protein that you just spend a lot of energy making, and it's just dysfunctional now. Can you change the three d state? They tend to be sticky and they land on tissues, and they like to land on long standing tissues, so like collagen. And it can destroy the collagen. And this is one of the reasons that skin droops over time. It's why why you get congestive heart failure without coronary disease, for example. So that's a big problem. Additionally, they're extremely inflammatory. So AGE is number one inflammatory by themselves, but then they land on these things called RAGEs, which are receptors for AGEs, and they exude even more inflammatory factors. You can see that by the time you are old, you are just in absolute state of inflammation. It's just pretty horrible.
