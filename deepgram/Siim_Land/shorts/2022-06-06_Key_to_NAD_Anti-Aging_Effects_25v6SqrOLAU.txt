We also see that boosting NAD with, NAD, supplements or precursors improves health span. So it, reduces the expression of these comorbidities, like insulin resistance and diabetes, like taking NAD boosters. The main two ones being, NMN or nicotinamide mononucleotide and NR, nicotinamide riboside. Using those as precursors, they raise NAD levels in subjects in humans, and they also improve metabolic health, and, they have neuro predictive effects. But I wouldn't go about saying that, you know, just take the pill, just take the NAD supplement, and, you're gonna, you know, basically live longer and be healthier. There are many, you know, ways your body can produce NAD. The precursor supplements are just one of them. And, your body can also make NAD from food, although to a much smaller degree. And it can also produce its NAD on a daily basis continually by recycling it.
