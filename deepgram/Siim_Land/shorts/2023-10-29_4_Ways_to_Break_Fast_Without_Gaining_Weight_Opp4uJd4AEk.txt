The biggest mistake people make when breaking their fast is eating whatever they like. Here are four simple foods to break your fast with that don't lead to gaining weight. Number one, vinegar and olive oil. Adding these to a salad is the best way to break a fast because they help with digestion and blood sugar response. Number two, bone broth. Starting off with a warm liquid like bone broth or soup is very good for your digestion and it makes it easier in your stomach to transition from a fasted state into a fed one. Number three, protein. It is important to make sure that you eat enough protein after breaking the fast. I recommend starting off with a more digestible protein like fish. Number four, carbs after vegetables and protein. After you've kick started your digestive system again, eat the protein and vegetables first before eating carbohydrates. This will help to maintain a better blood sugar response. These four tips will help you avoid binge eating and prepares your body for better metabolism and digestion.
