Berberine is a plant alkaloid that's said to have many health benefits. Some people even call it nature's Ozempic that helps with weight loss. Others call it nature's metformin that helps with blood sugar. Two meta analyses of randomized controlled trials from 2021 and 2022 saw that berberine is effective for lowering blood sugar levels in diabetes. It's not as strong as metformin, but berberine can help to manage blood sugar levels. For weight management, a 2020 meta analysis of randomized controlled trials found that berberine helps with weight loss, but it's not as powerful as Ozempic. But the most interesting thing about berberine isn't about weight loss or diabetes. Berberine is also a senolytic, which means it helps to eliminate senescent zombie cells that accumulate with aging. Berberine is also an AMPK activator, which activates many longevity pathways in the body. Lastly, berberine might even reduce arterial plaque as shown by a 2021 study. Meta analysis on 2022 and 2023 concluded that berberine supplementation can improve cardiometabolic risk factors such as lipids, insulin resistance, and anthropometric measures. Follow for more.
