Sauna after lifting weights is amazing for boosting recovery and muscle growth. It increases growth hormone, improves blood flow to the muscle, reduces muscle breakdown, and reduces inflammation. Here's how to use the sauna to make more gains. A 2021 study on young healthy men saw that 12 sessions of high temperature sauna improved bone and muscle mass. Heat exposure reduces muscle catabolism through the upregulation of heat shock proteins. These heat shock proteins go through the body to repair misfolded proteins and reduce inflammation. The heat also promotes blood flow, which increases recovery and causes mild muscle swelling. Sauna has been shown to increase growth hormone, which doesn't make you build muscle, but it does reduce muscle breakdown. So if you lift weights and then go to the sauna, you're hitting two birds with one stone, reducing muscle breakdown, and you're promoting recovery. The optimal temperature appears to be above 70 degrees Celsius for the heart benefits and up to a 100 degrees Celsius for the growth hormone benefits. Do it for twenty to thirty minutes after lifting weights and you'll see improvements. Follow for more.
