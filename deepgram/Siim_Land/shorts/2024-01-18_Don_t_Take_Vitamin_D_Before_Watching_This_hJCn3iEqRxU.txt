Vitamin d is the master hormone inside your body. A deficiency in vitamin d can lead to many health problems and increase the risk of death. However, don't just take a vitamin d supplement. The reason is that taking large amounts of vitamin d alone is going to increase the amount of calcium in your blood, which can promote vascular calcification. To prevent that, you have to take vitamin d together with vitamin k two. Vitamin k two helps to direct the calcium into your bones and prevents calcification. You also want to take magnesium because it activates vitamin d. Lastly, boron is another mineral that improves vitamin d utilization and enhances bone density. So just taking vitamin d alone isn't a smart thing. I'm not saying that you need to start taking all of these four supplements. Before taking vitamin d in the first place, you should do a vitamin d blood test to see whether or not you even need to supplement vitamin d. If your vitamin d levels are already high, then supplementing could be harmful. Follow for more.
