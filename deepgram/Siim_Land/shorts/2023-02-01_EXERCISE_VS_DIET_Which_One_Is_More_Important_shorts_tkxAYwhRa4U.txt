I came across this article on New York Times. You won't live longer by diet or exercise alone, study says. Sprawling new research show that healthy eating and regular workouts do not, in isolation, stave off later health issues. They need to be done together. So this is a study. They actually took over 300,000 people from The UK Biopank database, and they followed up about eleven point two years, which is quite a long follow-up to see the result. And when you compare physical activity and diet combination, then the lowest risk combinations were consistently found with the higher levels of activity and the highest diet quality. If you have the highest diet quality and higher levels of physical activity, that is when you see the best improvements and the the lowest risk. And apparently, you have super high levels of physical activity but low level of diet quality, then that isn't enough to really compensate for the lack of diet quality. And vice versa, if you have like a super good diet but you don't exercise, then that also isn't enough to see like a significant reduction compared to having those both things combined.
