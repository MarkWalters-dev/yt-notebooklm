Would adding collagen and glycine to coffee inhibit absorption? I haven't seen anything that could suggest that. There is one thing that coffee that it does make you lose some glycine, but the amount's zero point one milligrams. So it's very small, a hundred milligrams or something like that of, glycine that you lose from coffee. So I do think that it's huge, some glycine to the coffee because it's also sweet. So you don't have to use sugar. With collagen, obviously, it mixes with coffee. It generally does reduce the absorption of many things. It reduces the absorption of, obviously, iron, for example, and other nutrients. I think the best way to drink coffee is to not add a bunch of stuff for supplements or nutraceuticals in there. So just drink the coffee on an empty stomach or with food to reduce the absorption of, let's say, iron or some other compounds that you don't want to absorb necessarily. But with collagen and glycine, I would take them separately, generally. Glycine can be added because, I mean, you would just generally take that much more glycine. If you take, like, three grams of glycine with coffee, then it's not gonna, like, have any harmful effect.
