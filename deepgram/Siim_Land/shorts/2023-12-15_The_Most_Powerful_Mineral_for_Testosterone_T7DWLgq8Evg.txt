There's nothing boring about boron, and I'm gonna tell you why. Boron helps with bone mineralization. It improves vitamin d. It also improves testosterone and estrogen status, increases antioxidant events, reduces inflammation, and reduces magnesium loss. Boron is the most underrated yet one of the most effective minerals for increasing testosterone and estrogen. Both estrogen and testosterone levels have been shown to double in women and men after an increase in boron intake in individuals who were previously on a low boron diet. Boron doesn't have an established REA. An intake of one to two milligrams of boron is enough to prevent deficiencies, but three milligrams a day is more optimal. Boron is found the most in plant foods, such as legumes, vegetables, tubers, and fruit. Boron doesn't accumulate in fish or land animals, but it does in algae, seaweed, and plants. Prunes are an excellent source of boron, providing one point five to three milligrams of boron per three ounces. Follow for more.
