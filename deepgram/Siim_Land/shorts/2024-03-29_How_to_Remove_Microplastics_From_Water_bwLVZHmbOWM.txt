Microplastics are everywhere, and they can have negative effects on your health. A recent 2024 study found that people with high amounts of microplastics in their arteries were at a fourfold higher risk of heart disease events and death. Here's one way of removing microplastics from your water. A 2024 study show that boiling water is able to remove at least 80% of nano and microplastics. Water is a huge source of microplastics, especially if you drink tap water or plastic bottled water. When you're at home, it's then a smart idea to use a water filter and boil the water before drinking. When you're not at home and you can't boil the water, then always opt for glass bottled water whenever possible. It's also found that algae like spirulina and chlorella can degrade microplastics through enzymatic reactions. Olgy is also a good binder that can bind to heavy metals and other chemicals. So whenever you're traveling, you might want to have some chlorella tablets with you to bind to all the different kinds of toxins in the environment as well as the microplastics. It's not a 100% perfect method, but at least it's going to minimize some of the exposure. Follow for more.
