Sim, rank these health trends from one to 10, red light therapy. Eight. It has quite a lot of clinical trials for skin benefits mostly, even, muscle soreness and exercise performance and, eye health as well, myopia. Carnivore diet. It's a six because it has some therapeutic value for some individuals, but, I don't think it's a long term most optimal diet, you know, and it's not necessary. There's nothing inherently necessary that an average person would need to, follow. Sugar diet. Sugar diet is, four. I think it, has some short term weight loss benefits by increasing metabolic rate if you do it properly. But in the long term, it probably has negative effects on dental health, possibly neurodegeneration, skin aging. Infrared sauna. Infrared sauna is a 10, in my opinion, you know, very beneficial for, sweating out, different kinds of toxins as well as improving cardiovascular health. Urine therapy. I think urine therapy is probably one. If you're a deserted island, and, you need to survive, then, it can, you know, provide some liquids and hydration, but, know, completely unnecessary and, no proven health benefits. AgeBot. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, 7.5. Mouth taping. 9.5 or possibly 10 because if you are breathing through the mouth during your sleep then, you know, that's gonna be very bad for your sleep quality. And hypertension, cardiac health, brain health, sleep apnea and breathing through the mouth will accelerate brain aging and, accelerate just aging itself and increases risk of many diseases.
