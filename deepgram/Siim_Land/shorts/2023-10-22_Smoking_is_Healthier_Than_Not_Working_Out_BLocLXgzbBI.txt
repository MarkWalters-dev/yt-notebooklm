Not working out is worse for you than smoking. People think that smoking is the worst thing you can do to your health. But there is actually one thing that is much worse. Even if you don't smoke, you need to exercise regularly to maintain your health. In fact, not exercising is worse for your health than smoking, diabetes and heart disease. Having low cardiorespiratory fitness is linked to a four times higher risk of all cause mortality compared to having high cardiorespiratory fitness. If you're obese and you smoke your mortality risk is three to five times higher. Being unfit and not having huge cardiorespiratory fitness is as bad for you as smoking. A 2022 study saw that the lowest mortality risk was at the VO2 max of around forty nine to fifty. They didn't see any upper limit to this benefit. The least fit individuals had four times higher risk of all cause mortality than the most fit individuals. Having a higher VO two max and better cardiorespiratory fitness is one of the biggest predictors of mortality.
