10 health foods that are actually bad for you. No one believes me when I say that these healthy foods are actually bad for you. Although whole fruit is very healthy, drinking fruit juice raises your blood sugar levels very high and it's linked to a higher risk of diabetes. Sports drinks also have a lot of added sugar. Another drink that is very high in added sugars and is going to raise blood sugar levels is oat milk. Now cruciferous vegetables are very healthy when you cook them, but if you eat them raw, it can inhibit iodine absorption and can damage your thyroid gland. Raw kale is also damaging to your thyroid and your kidneys. Canola oil is usually oxidized and inflammatory. Banana chips are much higher in calories than regular bananas. Processed meat like ham and bacon are associated with increased risk of cancer and mortality. There's nothing healthy about margarine and it is associated with increased risk of heart disease. And finally, we have salad dressing which is full of added oils and sugars. So before you believe anyone about these health foods, be careful and protect your body.
