There are dangers all around your grocery store that no one is talking about. Plant based butters, things like margarine and vegetable spreads, are made of a lot of hydrogenated oils and canola oil. These oils are very high in omega sixes that increase inflammation and oxidative stress inside your body. They can cause insulin resistance, acne and weight gain. Next up, we have sauces like tomato sauces, bologna sauce or any other sauce that comes in a package. These sauces are very high in sugar and added oils. They're going to raise your blood sugar levels a lot more than regular homemade sauces. Next up we have juices. Sugar sweetened beverage consumption is actually linked to higher risk of mortality and diabetes. One glass of regular orange juice has about 20 grams of sugar. That's about half of what is recommended to be safe per day. Plant burgers are full of added oils and other ingredients that are not good for your health. They're not even lower in calories than actual meat. In fact, they might contain more calories than regular meat, and they have a lot more omega six fatty acids that cause inflammation inside your body.
