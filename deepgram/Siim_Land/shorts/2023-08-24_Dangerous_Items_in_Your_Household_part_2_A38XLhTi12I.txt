There are dangers all around your home that no one is talking about. Plastic containers are very convenient and durable, but you should definitely not put them into the microwave or heat them up. High temperatures release all of these microplastics and xenoestrogens inside the plastic containers into your food. Excess exposure to these microplastics can have a negative effect on your fertility, your hormones, and overall health. Using plastic containers to store food inside the fridge or other ingredients in the cupboard is fine because they're not being heated. But if you want to cook or heat something up then you should definitely use stainless steel, glass or porcelain because these microplastics can accumulate inside your body. The second source of harmful ingredients in your house come from detergents and bleaches. They contain different kinds of fragrances and chemicals that have a similar negative effect on your fertility and reproductive health. You're washing your dishes and your clothes with these detergents and bleaches. So over the course of a longer period of time, these xenoestrogens accumulate inside your body. So opt for more natural options.
