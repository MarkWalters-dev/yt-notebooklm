There are many things that, make you age faster, but there is one specific thing that accelerate your aging much more than anything else. So essentially, most people know that being overweight and being obese is not good for health. And, it is, in my opinion, also one of the biggest things that does accelerate your aging. It does have a negative effect on your mortality and, of course, so, you know, you will look older. In this 2009 Lancet study, the lowest mortality in people is around twenty two point twenty five BMI. So in conclusion, being obese and being overweight is the biggest thing that accelerates your aging and is also the biggest contributor to your risk of mortality.
