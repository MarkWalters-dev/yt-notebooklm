Everyone knows being overweight is bad for your health. However, did you know that being skinny but unfit is actually worse? A 2021 meta analysis on obesity treatments discovered that being normal weight and unfit actually puts you at a greater risk of all cause mortality and cardiovascular disease compared to being obese and fit. Now this doesn't mean that being obese is somehow good for you. The study found that the lowest risk of death was among people who were normal weight but also very fit. They categorized levels of fitness based on the participants' VO two max. Thus, being fit as measured by having a higher VO two max is more important than being skinny or just normal body weight. You wanna be working on your cardio respiratory fitness no matter your body weight, but having a high VO two max and cardio respiratory fitness is protective against the other harms of obesity. Being obese clearly increases your risk of mortality, but having high cardio respiratory fitness might mitigate against some of that harm. A higher VA two max is one of the biggest predictors of longevity and reduced mortality seen in multiple studies. How do you increase your VA two max? By doing more cardio and exercise.
