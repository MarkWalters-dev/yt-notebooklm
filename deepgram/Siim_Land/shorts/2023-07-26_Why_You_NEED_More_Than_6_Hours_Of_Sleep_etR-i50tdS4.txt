No one believes me when I say that not sleeping enough could kill you. Sleeping less than six hours has terrible side effects on your health. Making sure that you get more than six hours of sleep will drastically improve your health. This is because adults require seven to eight hours of sleep per night to be at their 100% maximum, and this requirement increases the more physically active you are. Let's say you only sleep five hours a day. Did you know that this can make your blood sugar and blood pressure rise? You would also start burning more muscle instead of fat. And on top of that, not getting enough sleep makes you overeat. Sleeping less than six hours keeps your body under constant wear and tear because you don't have enough time to repair. Over time, it's gonna cause wrinkles and skin aging. Getting more than six hours of sleep is quite crucial. That's because sleeping less than five hours has been found to be linked to a fifteen percent higher risk of death. So always make sure that you sleep enough.
