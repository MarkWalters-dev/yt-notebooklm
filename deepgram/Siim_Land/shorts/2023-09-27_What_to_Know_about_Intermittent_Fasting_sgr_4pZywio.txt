I've been eating one meal a day for six years. Here's what you need to know about my intermittent fasting routine. Now people usually use fasting for weight loss or longevity, but I personally have also used it to build muscle. If you want to see continuous improvements in your fitness and muscle growth while doing interval fasting, the amino acids help you to reduce muscle catabolism and help with muscle growth. That's why I eat one meal a day but I have a protein shake before my workout to support the muscle growth. In the morning, I don't consume anything that has calories. I might have some teas or coffees. Then before my workout, I have my protein shake, I work out and then after the workout, I have my dinner. My daily calorie intake is between 2,000 to 2,500 calories. The foods I eat after the workout are generally some protein source like meat, fish, eggs or crump with some vegetables and carbohydrates like potatoes, beetroot, and broccoli. Over the course of this six years, I've seen a lot of improvements in my health and muscle growth. And I also think that this is one of the healthiest ways to build muscle, but it may not be suitable for everyone.
