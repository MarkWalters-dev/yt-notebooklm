Ozempic is quickly becoming one of the most popular drugs of all time. It's FDA approved for treatment of obesity and type two diabetes. However, there's been rumors that berberine is nature's Ozempic with similar benefits. First, Ozempic or semaglutide are GLP one receptor agonists, which means they increase GLP one expression, which promotes insulin production and lowers blood sugar levels. Berberine, on the other hand, is a natural plant alkaloid that also has GLP one stimulating effects. A 2022 meta analysis found that berberine supplementation does improve cardiometabolic risk factors such as cholesterol, blood sugar, obesity, and waist circumference. So berberine has anti diabetic and anti obesity effects. However, the weight loss effects of berberine are pennies compared to the weight loss effects of semaglutide. People taking semaglutide are expected to lose up to 10 to 20% of their body weight within two years. When it comes to berberine, then the expected weight loss is only like a few kilograms and a few centimeters around your waistline. Follow for more.
