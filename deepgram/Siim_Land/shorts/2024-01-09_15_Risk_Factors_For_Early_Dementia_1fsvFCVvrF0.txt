Losing your cognition is one of the worst things that can happen with age. Early onset dementia is a form of dementia that occurs in people before the age of 65. A new systematic review found 15 risk factors for young onset dementia. Here are these 15 risk factors. Number one, lower formal education. Number two, lower socioeconomic status. Number three, having two Apolipoprotein e four alleles. Number four, no alcohol use. This could be confounded by the fact that people who don't drink alcohol usually have some health problems or they used to have alcohol problems. Number five, alcohol use disorder. Number six, social isolation. Number seven, vitamin d deficiency. Number eight, high c reactive protein levels. Number nine, lower hand grip strength. Number 10, hearing impairment. Number 11, orthostatic hypotension. This is a medical condition where a person's blood pressure drops when standing up or sitting down. 12, stroke. 13, diabetes. 14, heart disease. And 15, depression. These are mostly modifiable risk factors.
