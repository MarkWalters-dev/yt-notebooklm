Why not to take glycine with protein rich foods? What can happen? I do actually recommend to take glycine with protein rich foods. I've never said anything against that or otherwise. And it's a good idea to take glycine with protein rich foods, especially foods that have a lot of methionine. Because the glycine helps to balance the the methionine. Excess methionine can raise your homocysteine. And we know from animal studies that excess methionine also accelerates aging and children's lifespan. I think it makes sense to take some glycine with the protein rich food, whatever you're eating.
