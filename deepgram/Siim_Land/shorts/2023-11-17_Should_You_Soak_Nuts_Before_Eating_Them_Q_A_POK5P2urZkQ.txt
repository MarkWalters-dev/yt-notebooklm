I love eating nuts for their health benefits but I never know if I need to soak them before eating them. Nuts are a great fat source and they could be included into your diet. Soaking them removes the phytic acid, which is an anti nutrient found in the nuts. But phytic acid actually has some health benefits as well. So there are some benefits to soaking the nuts but usually it isn't necessary. The change is minimal and phytic acid isn't an actively harmful ingredient. But if you want to eat legumes and peanuts then I would recommend soaking them. Soaking peanuts and legumes improves their digestion which makes them much more easier to eat.
