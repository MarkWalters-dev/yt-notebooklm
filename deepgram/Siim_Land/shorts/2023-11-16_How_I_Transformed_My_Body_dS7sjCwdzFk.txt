Here's how I transformed my body. This was my physique ten years ago in the military when I weighed sixty eight kilograms. Today I weigh around eighty to eighty two kilograms while eating only one meal a day and being in the best shape of my life. Here's how I did it. At first, I ate only one meal a day with no additional calories but my progress was very slow with this approach. Then I developed my own protocol called targeted intermittent fasting. Basically, I ate an early dinner at about four to 5PM but I'll also have a protein shake at noon before my workout. This provides my body with the necessary amino acids that help to build muscle and reduce muscle breakdown. After the workout I'll have my food that gives me the rest of my calories. Because of my confined eating window it's very easy to stay lean year round and not gain weight. So this diet is perfect for building muscle and staying lean at the same time.
