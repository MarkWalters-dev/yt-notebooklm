We all know that exercise and lifting weights is good for your longevity. However, there's one specific type of exercise that might be the best for the elderly. It's called blood flow restriction training. You basically wrap bands around your limbs to create partial inflow to the muscles and restrict the outflow. Sounds terrifying, but it's not a medical tourniquet that causes a 100% occlusion. Blood flow restriction training utilizes only 40 to 60% pressure. As a result, the blood begins to build up in the muscles, which improves circulation, stimulates muscle growth, and supports cardiovascular function. It's also been found to trigger muscle hypertrophy at only 20 to 30% of one rep max, whereas regular weightlifting usually is 70 to 80%. You basically trick your body into thinking that it's lifting heavier weights that it actually is due to the restricted blood flow. Blood flow restriction training is amazing for preventing muscle atrophy during bed rest or injuries. You can still stimulate muscle growth without having to lift heavy weights, which makes it probably the best form of resistance training for the elderly. It also causes less muscle damage. Ulcera restriction training is considered to be safe, and the risk of thromboembolism is less than zero point one percent.
