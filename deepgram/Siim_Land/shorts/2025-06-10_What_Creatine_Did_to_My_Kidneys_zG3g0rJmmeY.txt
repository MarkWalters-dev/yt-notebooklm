I recently megadosed twenty eight grams of creatine for a week. Then I took eight to ten grams for two weeks. Wait, isn't creatine bad for your kidneys? Well, I actually measured my kidney markers like creatinine, eGFR, sodium, uric acid and cystatin c and they all stayed in the normal range before and after the experiment. That's not surprising to me because I'm otherwise healthy and I have optimal kidney function. Creatine has been seen to only be harmful for your kidneys if you have already bad kidney function or kidney damage. If you take creatine, you might see an increase in creatinine levels, but that's not always indicative of kidney damage. Creatinine levels rise if your body metabolizes more protein from diet or because of exercise. There's a tight correlation between having more muscle mass and higher creatinine levels, but it's not indicative of kidney damage or kidney dysfunction if your eGFR is normal. You can calculate your eGFR which is a general marker of a kidney health from both creatinine and cystatin c. Instead of calculating it from creatinine, you should use cystatin c because Cystatin C is less affected by muscle mass and exercise. So it's a more accurate representation of your kidney function. So if you are taking creatine and you are worried about your kidneys then don't be unless you have kidney damage. Follow for more.
