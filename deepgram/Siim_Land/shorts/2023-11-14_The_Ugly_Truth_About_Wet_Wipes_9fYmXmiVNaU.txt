Your video on the dangers of toilet paper really blew my mind. Are wet wipes just as bad for you? White bleached toilet paper contains xenoestrogens. Wet wipes contain the same chemicals. And because they're wet, you absorb a lot more of them than from the dry paper. So actually wet wipes are worse. Xenoestrogens are synthetic chemicals that mimic estrogen inside your body. This can cause hormonal disruption, estrogen dominance, and even weight gain. There is also the environmental aspect to this because wet wipes aren't biodegradable. They can also clog the sewer system and cause environmental pollution. If you want a safe alternative, then the best thing to use is just natural, unbleached toilet paper.
