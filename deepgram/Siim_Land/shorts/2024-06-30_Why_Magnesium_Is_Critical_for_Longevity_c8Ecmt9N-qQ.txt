Magnesium is one of the most important minerals in the body. It governs hundreds of vital processes, and a deficiency in magnesium is a serious health concern. However, a recent study highlighted how magnesium is central to the hallmarks of aging. Low magnesium accelerates the development of all the hallmarks, and in so doing also increases the risk of neurodegeneration, diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. The biggest and most detrimental hallmark caused by low magnesium is chronic inflammation. So you should focus on getting enough magnesium on a regular basis because it's one of those minerals that can have the most negative side effect on your health. The highest magnesium pools include pumpkin seeds, almonds, salmon, seafood, hemp seeds, and mineral waters. Unfortunately, up to fifty percent of people aren't getting enough magnesium. So one of the few worthwhile supplements many people would benefit from taking is magnesium. I'm taking the Nord Code magnesium because it contains six different types of magnesium.
