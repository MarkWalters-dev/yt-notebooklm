There are like dozens of studies showing higher frequency of sauna use is associated with better health outcomes. In this particular study from Finland, they did see that going to the sauna four to seven times per week had a much greater reduction in heart disease and cardiovascular disease mortality compared to taking a sauna even two to three or just one time per week. So overall, what happens if I take the sauna every day, then you're gonna feel better. You're gonna have a bit more energy, sleep better. You'll have better recovery and better metabolic profile as well overall. Do I recommend taking a soda every day? I don't think there's anything harmful taking a soda every day, but you don't need to do it any more than four times. At least the study showed that the four times is where you get the maximum benefits and you don't see any additional benefits going for seven times per week.
