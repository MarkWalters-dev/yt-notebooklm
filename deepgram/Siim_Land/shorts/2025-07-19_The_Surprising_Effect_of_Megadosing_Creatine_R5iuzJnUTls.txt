If you want to build muscle and strengthen, the recommended dose of creatine is three to five grams a day. However, if you want to support your brain health, you need twice the amount of that. Taking huge doses of creatine up to twenty eight grams a day has also been seen to counteract the loss of cognition during sleep deprivation. So whenever you didn't get enough sleep and you need your brain to work properly, take twenty eight grams of creatine.
