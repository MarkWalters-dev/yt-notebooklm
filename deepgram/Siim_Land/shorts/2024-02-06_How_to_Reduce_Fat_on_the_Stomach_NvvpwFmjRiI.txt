It's commonly said that you can't spot reduce fat specifically on the stomach. You need to lose fat all around the body, and stomach fat is usually the last place to go. However, a new 2023 study found that spot reduction might be possible. They took two groups of overweight men and made them work out four times a week. The first group ran on a treadmill for forty five minutes only. The second group did twenty seven minutes of treadmill running plus eight rounds of four minutes of abdominal exercises. After ten weeks, both groups lost a similar amount of weight and fat. However, the ab training group apparently lost more fat on their abs. The ab training group also maintained more muscle, whereas the treadmill only group lost it. Another 2017 study saw that spot reduction is indeed plausible. This doesn't mean that you can just do ab training and get abs. You definitely need to be in a calorie deficit, and based on this study, you need to combine ab training with cardiovascular exercise as well. Follow for more.
