A study showing how suppressing mTOR is beneficial for slowing down aging. MTOR is this growth pathway in the body that regulates cell replication, neurogenesis, muscle growth and cancer cell growth as well. It makes everything grow. It makes the good things grow and bad things grow. And the thing with mTOR is that if you keep replicating your cells, your cells keep growing then they are shortening their lifespan as well. In the process or you're like you're reaching the end cell line faster because of every cell they have their replication limit. It's called the Hayflick's limit, which means that there's only a certain amount of replications your cell can make before it becomes senescent and turns into like a zombie cell. Protein is a big stimulator of mTOR because of containing amino acids and the specific amino acid that is most responsible and causes the biggest increase in mTOR activation is leucine. It's one of the essential amino acids and leucine is directly the one that activates muscle protein synthesis and turns on mTOR. That is what the association between protein intake, aging and cancer and all those things come from. The leucine as well as other essential amino acids like methine.
