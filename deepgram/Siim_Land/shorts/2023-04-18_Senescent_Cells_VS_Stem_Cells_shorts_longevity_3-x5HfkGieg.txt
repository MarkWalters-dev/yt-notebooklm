All cells are not the same. Stem cells, we really wanna take care of. And stem cells, of course, have some advantages that regular cells don't and that they can increase their they have telomerase, so they can increase their telomeres. But other than that, they're set up for failure. And we wanna keep them as healthy as possible because this is where all of the rest of our cells come from. In the same category is senescent cells. We want to get rid of senescent cells. So this is when a regular standard cell experiences DNA damage. The cell goes into a state of hibernation, which is called quiescence. The cell can either repair itself, and it goes back to being a happy little cell, or one of three things happens. It either becomes apoptotic, which is just sort of commit cell suicide. Alternatively, a cell becomes cancerous or becomes senescent.
