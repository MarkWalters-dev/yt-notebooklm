Deep sleep is incredibly important for health and longevity. Here are the foods that help you to get more deep sleep. Number one, kiwis have been seen to improve total sleep duration and sleep quality in multiple studies. Eating one to two kiwis a few hours before bed can do wonders for your deep sleep. Number two, carbs for dinner. Having a dinner that comprises of fibrous complex carbs like potatoes helps to increase serotonin in the brain, which then gets converted into melatonin. If you eat a lot of protein, then the branched chain amino acids prevent tryptophan from entering into the brain to convert into serotonin. Carbohydrates raise insulin, which clears the blood from branched chain aminos, and it enables tryptophan to go into the brain. Carbs also make you more relaxed and tired, which increases deep sleep. Number three, cherries are very high in melatonin, the sleep hormone. You're unlikely to get all the melatonin you need from just cherries. However, tart cherry juice has been seen to increase sleep duration and depth. Number four, milk has both melatonin and tryptophan, which makes it a good drink before bed. Go for more.
