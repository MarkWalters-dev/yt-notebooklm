Going to share with you what I do for clear and healthy skin. Number one, I take ten grams of collagen a day. There are a lot of human studies showing that collagen peptides are able to reverse hallmarks of skin aging and improve skin elasticity. That's going to help with the skin texture and firmness, but it's not going to help with the pimples and acne. For that, it's important to maintain a healthy body weight. Excess body fat promotes inflammation more than anything else, and it also promotes pimples. Or two, you need to clean your face regularly. Just washing your face with soap might not be enough. That's why I attribute a lot of my skin cleanness to taking the sauna regularly. The sweating helps to clean out your skin pores and removes the dust thoroughly. I also use the Alitura clay mask once a week because it's able to bind to all the dust and dead skin cells. The best thing about alitura is that they use natural food grade ingredients. No other chemicals or potentially harmful ingredients to your skin. You can get a 20% discount with the code seam at alitura.com for all their skin care products. Next, I also do resistance training. Resistance training has been shown to rejuvenate aging skin and reduce inflammation.
