Coffee can be a good way to actually fix the circadian rhythms. Like, if you're not having enough energy in the morning, you may not be producing enough cortisol. And the cortisol is important for wakefulness. You need cortisol to wake up and coffee and caffeine can be a good way to actually reset your circadian rhythm. By just, you know, drinking in the morning, you see this spike in cortisol a little bit and actually helps to align it. I wouldn't like, yeah, drink coffee in the evening or something or in the afternoon even because it can disrupt your sleep and keep you awake. But in the morning, it's actually a good thing.
