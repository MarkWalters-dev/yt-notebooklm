Most people take NAD boosters like NMN, NR and niacin for the sake of longevity. But what if I told you they could actually ruin your sleep? A few weeks ago, my client was having exactly this issue. They were taking high dose niacin for improving their lipids and they had problems falling asleep for a few years. After they took a break from niacin their sleep improved. He basically had too much energy which is why he wasn't able to sleep seven or eight hours. And he did measure his NAD levels with a test and his NAD was several standard deviations above the reference range from taking danosin. But it's not that simple. NAD boosters can also improve your sleep if you take them at the right time. In mice nicotinamide riboside has been seen to enhance circadian clock function, increase REM sleep and reduce n REM sleep. In humans, NR improves sleep efficiency and quality in people who have insomnia. In regards to NMN, then human clinical trials have seen that it does improve sleep. Nigatonic acid which is niacin in mice has been seen to increase n rem sleep by up to a 120, but that comes at the expense of rem sleep and deep sleep. You're essentially getting more shallow sleep. The doses that resulted in this were two hundred fifty milligrams per kilogram of body weight which for the mice was around six point twenty five milligrams. My client was taking around two thousand milligrams which is still lower relative to body weight. For them, they would have had to take fifteen thousand milligrams to get a body weight equivalent dose. But it still might be that niacin reduces sleep quality, at least in the context of someone who already had very high NAD levels such as my client.
