So the TRIM protocol is based around the idea that relatively early in life, so adolescence or post puberty, early 20s, there's a pretty dramatic decrease in thymic function. And our thymus is important for, among other things, producing t cells, which are really important for the function of our immune system. It's called TRIM. Mhmm. The protocol is basically growth hormone, d h e a, which is a a precursor for testosterone, and other hormones, and metformin. And the rationale, as I understand it, is the growth hormone is really doing the action here. Mhmm. So the growth hormone does a couple of things to the thymus. The DHEA is sort of in there, not a great scientific rationale, but but in part because DHEA goes down with the agent in it and it may have some benefit for thymic function and maintaining hormonal balance. The metformin is in there because growth hormone can have a negative impact on insulin sensitivity and, glucose, homeostasis. So metformin, again, anti diabetes drug. Number of small but intriguing human studies, evidence that the TRMM protocol over several months can improve thymic volume, reduce the fat infiltration, and probably improve t cell function and immune function, although that hasn't been measured in as much, depth as at least I would like to see. They also have some evidence that the epigenetic clocks that we were talking about earlier, show what would be perceived as, improvements in biological age or reduced risk of mortality. I would say pretty intriguing data and it certainly makes sense that improving thymic function in older people is going to be generally beneficial. So I personally am at some point going to give TRIM a try.
