Ever wonder what stress does to your body? From a biological perspective, stress can have a huge negative effect on your health and body. First of all, it can raise cortisol, which can break down the collagen in your skin if it stays elevated all the time. As a result of that, you will develop more wrinkles and your sleep quality will also suffer. Stress can also encourage overeating and makes you want to eat more junk food. Your metabolism will slow down a bit and it's easier to gain weight. You lose more muscle, you burn less fat and you also impair your blood sugar regulation. Clearly stress can be detrimental to your long term health and well-being but there are many ways to mitigate stress and cope with it such as physical exercise, spending time in nature, social relationships and just relaxing.
