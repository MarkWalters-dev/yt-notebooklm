Don't take large amounts of melatonin. Let me explain. Melatonin supplementation has been found to be very safe and even in doses up to fifty milligrams, it doesn't inhibit natural melatonin production. However, the human body naturally makes only around zero point one to zero point three milligrams of melatonin before bed. So if you take more than that, then you may just feel very groggy and tired after waking up. Melatonin at very large doses of seventy five milligrams also acts as a contraceptive which definitely could have some negative aspects on fertility if you do it all the time. Doses of up to eight or ten milligrams can be used to counteract jet lag and circadian rhythm mismatches but on an everyday basis, you should either use very small amounts of melatonin like zero point one or zero point three milligrams or no melatonin at all.
