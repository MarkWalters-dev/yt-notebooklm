Think you're making a healthy food choice? You might want to check again. Here are three foods that are surprisingly high in sugar and why you should avoid them. Number one, protein bars. While protein bars are marketed as a health and fitness food, they actually contain quite a lot of sugar. What's worse, most of these protein bars actually aren't that high in protein. So make sure you choose a protein bar that actually has more protein and less sugar. Number two is chocolate milk. Milk can be good for you because it contains calcium, which which is good for your bones. But when companies like Nestle make chocolate milk out of it, they end up adding so much sugar that makes it bad for your health. Number three is granola. Main ingredient is oats but a lot of times, honey and and other sugars are also added. In total, one serving of granola can have a lot of sugar. I would encourage you to keep tabs on how much sugar are you actually eating per day because it can add up quite fast. If you want to improve your blood sugar levels then I would stick around 10 to 20 sugar per day. But if you're a healthy person who is also physically active then you can eat a little bit more than that.
