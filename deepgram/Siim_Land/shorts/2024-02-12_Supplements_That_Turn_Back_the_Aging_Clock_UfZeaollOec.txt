Reversing aging is considered to be impossible. Well, that depends on what you mean by reversing aging. Indeed, you can't directly reverse it by turning an old person into a biologically younger person, but you can make yourself more youthful and healthier overall, which correlates to a lower biological age. Here are the supplements that have been shown to lower biological age. A 2019 study saw reduction in biological age by using a cocktail of supplements and pharmaceuticals. They included growth hormone metformin, DHEA, and vitamin d three. After one year of taking these, the people saw a two point five year reduction in their biological age and regeneration of the thymus. Number two, glynaq is a combo of glycine and NAC that's been shown to reverse the hallmarks of aging in multiple human clinical trial. Three, calcium alpha ketoglutarate is a supplement that's been found to reduce biological age by eight years in just seven months. The problem is that this study hasn't been replicated, and it was done by a supplement company on their supplement. Follow for more.
