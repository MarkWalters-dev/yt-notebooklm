The most common source of infrared light that people get exposed to is the sunlight. But nowadays, you can also use infrared saunas and different kinds of light emitting devices to get that infrared light as well. From the antiaging side, then, infrared radiation has also been used as an effective way to help with photoaging, skin photoaging and pigmentation. But for me specifically, the most interesting thing about infrared light that I like is the aspect of how it affects your melatonin production. As you can see, when your body, especially the head and, the skull get exposed to sunlight, then, you know, the near infrared light will penetrate through the skull. And, that is what also helps with the production of serotonin and melatonin and everything else. So you need to have melatonin to repair and recover from the daily activities and to lower the oxygen stress, etcetera, to conduct the longevity pathways in your sleep. And one way to basically facilitate that, you need the exposure to the near infrared light that will help you to produce melatonin at night.
