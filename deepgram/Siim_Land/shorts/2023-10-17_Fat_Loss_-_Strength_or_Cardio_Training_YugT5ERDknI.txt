Pat loss, strength or cardio training? When it comes to strength training and cardio, which one is better? The simple answer is both. Here's why you should do strength training and cardio. Both exercises burn calories, but cardio burns more calories per hour than weights do. However, lifting weights increases your muscle mass and insulin sensitivity, which then increases your resting metabolic rate. As a result of that, you start burning more calories at rest while doing cardio is more of an active calorie burn. So, overall, you should try to do both.
