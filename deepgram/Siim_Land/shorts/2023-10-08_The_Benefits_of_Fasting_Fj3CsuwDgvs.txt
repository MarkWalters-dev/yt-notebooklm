Fasting isn't as scary as you think. There are actually many health benefits to going hungry for a couple of hours. Nutritionists always say that you need to snack several times a day and never go hungry. Otherwise, it's going to wreck your metabolism. But that's not true. Fasting can actually be much healthier for you than snacking all the time. Fasting increases stress resilience and supports the brain through neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. That's the process of growing new brain cells. While fasting, your body also taps into its body fat stores instead of relying on sugar. If you feel like you need to snack all the time then your body is stuck in the sugar burning mode and it doesn't get access to its body fat. After you get used to fasting, your body gets better at burning fat. Fasting also increases autophagy which is the process of clearing out cells from junk material. This has some antiaging benefits. If you put down the snacks and learn how to fast, then you're not gonna feel that hungry on your new schedule.
