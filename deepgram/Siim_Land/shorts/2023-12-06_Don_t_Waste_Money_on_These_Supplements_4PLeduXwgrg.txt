There are dozens of supplements that waste your money. Instead of making expensive urine, you should spend your money on something else. Here's a list of supplements that you shouldn't waste your money on. Number one, resveratrol. Resveratrol, which you naturally get from dark fruits and wine, is said to have longevity and antiaging benefits. However, there's no evidence for that in humans. Even in animal studies, resveratrol hasn't been conclusively shown to extend lifespan. On top of that, there are many human studies showing that resveratrol reduces ER to max, wants the positive effects of exercise, and lowers androgens in men. So there is no real reason to take resveratrol because the evidence about its benefits are limited, and it has some negative side effects. Plus, it's also quite expensive. Number two, branch gene amino acids or BCAs. BCAs are promoted to help with muscle growth and strength training. However, it's been shown that BCAs don't increase protein synthesis, but they actually increase muscle protein breakdown. So they can actually make you more catabolic rather than anabolic, and they certainly don't help with muscle growth.
