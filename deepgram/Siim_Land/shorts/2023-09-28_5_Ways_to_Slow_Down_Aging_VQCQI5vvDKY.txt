Many people are afraid of aging, but I'm not because I figured out a way to slow it down. Here are five anti aging habits you want to add to your daily routine. Number one. Don't overeat. Eating more than you should will lead to weight gain, and being overweight reduces your life expectancy a lot. Number two, don't restrict sleep. Sleep helps your body and brain recover. If you don't sleep enough, your body is going to wear down much faster. Number three, don't be chronically stressed out. Too much stress can disrupt your sleep. It can make you overeat and gain weight, and it also breaks down your body a lot faster. Number four. Add regular exercise. People who are very fit have up to forty five percent lower risk of mortality. Number five. Eat a good diet. A balanced meal with the right ingredients goes a long way in looking and feeling young. Seeing yourself becoming older is a common but scary feeling that is usually accompanied by wrinkles. But fast aging isn't predetermined, you can also slow it down with the right lifestyle habits.
