Best way to improve deep sleep. So for that deep sleep happens in the first half of the night which occurs in conjunction with the other repair hormones like melatonin, growth hormone and autophagy. But what you want to do is that before bed like an hour or so, you want to have already melatonin surging through your body. For that block out blue light, use red light in your bedroom, wind down, maybe take a melatonin supplement like one milligram and that's going to boost your melatonin levels already naturally. And when you do fall asleep, you're gonna have higher amounts of melatonin that helps with the repair and gets you more deep sleep. That's how you essentially do it.
