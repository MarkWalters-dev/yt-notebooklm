Probably one of the biggest misconceptions about autophagy is that you need to fast for like, you know, three to five days in order to activate some autophagy in the first place. There is truth to that that the longer you do fast, then you do see an increase in autophagy in across different species in humans as well. But you don't necessarily have to fast for like, you know, this extended period of time to even activate it in the first place. It's not this on and off switch that, you know, just turns on at over 72 or something like that. Autophagy happens to a certain degree all the time. And we also have studies, human studies that show that even as fast as sixteen hours of fasting is enough to increase the levels of basal autophagy. And the biggest thing that determines whether or not you see an increase in autologie or a decrease in it is your liver glycogen status essentially. So the liver glycogen regulates all these different pathways that also regulate autologie such as AMPK.
