I would like to be optimistic and say, yeah, hopefully the first 150 year old has already been born. There's some reason for optimism, certainly to believe that's possible. You can also point to reasons to think that that's probably unlikely. I think we just don't know at this point, but I do believe that we have an enormous opportunity by targeting the biology of aging in humans, even just given what we know today, to have a significant impact on healthy longevity. We're probably not talking thirty, forty years. We're probably talking ten, twenty years. That's still a big deal, right? And if we could get an extra fifteen years of health span, maybe lifespan, for most people, that's pretty significant. And I think that is well within the realm of feasibility, given what we know about the biology of aging today and a reasonable extrapolation of where that probably will go in the next few years.
