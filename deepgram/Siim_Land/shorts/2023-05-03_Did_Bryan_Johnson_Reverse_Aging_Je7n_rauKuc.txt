There are millions of things that change with age. If you do certain interventions, you can reverse some of those. So again, I think exercise is a great example. You can reverse a lot of the trait changes that go along with aging with exercise. But you're not gonna reverse everything. The best athletes in the world still get old. They still get wrinkles. They don't have life expectancies that much longer than everybody else, maybe ten years. You can do that with rapamycin, at least in mice. You can do that with epigenetic reprogramming, at least in mice. You can do that with sort of extreme lifestyle modifications like Brian Johnson and you can see some reversal. Do we really believe that he got younger, that he went from being old to young? I don't. I mean, if people wanna believe that they're welcome to, but I mean, it seems sort of ridiculous to me. So again, I don't view it as fundamentally any different than somebody who has never exercised, starting to exercise, lifting weights, walking, running, they're gonna look better and they're gonna function.
