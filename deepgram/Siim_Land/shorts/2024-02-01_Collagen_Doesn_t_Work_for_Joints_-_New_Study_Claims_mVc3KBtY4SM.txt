Collagen is thought to have benefits for the skin wrinkles and joint function. However, there's been a recent study that found that collagen might not work for the joints. They compared the effects of whey protein and collagen after lifting weights. Both whey and collagen protein raise connective tissue protein synthesis. So based on this study, collagen does work. It just shows that whey protein is superior for triggering protein synthesis in the connective tissue. However, there's something that collagen protein exceed whey protein in, and that's skin health and wrinkles. A 2023 meta analysis showed that hydrolyzed collagen supplementation significantly improves skin hydration and elasticity. That's the real reason you wanna take collagen as a supplement. There's no study showing that whey protein would reverse skin wrinkles or the hallmarks of skin aging. The brand of collagen I'm using, North Code, has added eggshell membrane, which has been shown to improve joint health, and vitamin c, which is essential for initiating collagen synthesis.
