The number one thing holding you back on your wellness journey is your misconception about fitness. Here are four myths that are ruining your perception on fitness. Number one, lifting heavy weights will make you bulky. That's not really true. Lifting weights can increase your strength and muscle size, but unless you're taking steroids, then you'll never become too bulky. If you eat too many calories and you gain too much fat, then you will become too bulky. Number two, lifting weights is only good for muscle growth and cardio is for losing fat. The reality is that you can lose weight on any form of exercise, but you should try to find a balance between lifting weights and doing cardio for the best health benefits. Number three, cardio is a waste of time. Actually, it's been found that cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with much lower risk of all cause mortality than lifting weights. Number four, you need to train to complete failure to see growth. You don't need to go to full failure. Around 75 to 80% is enough. Don't let these myths guide your workouts and include everything in moderation.
