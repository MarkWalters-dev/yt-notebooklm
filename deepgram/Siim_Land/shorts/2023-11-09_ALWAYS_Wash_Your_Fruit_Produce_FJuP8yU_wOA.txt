Always wash your fruit. Here's a kitchen hack that any adult who runs a household needs to know about. You always need to wash your fruit produce. Fruit is great but it's the most common target for pesticides and other chemical sprays. So you should soak the fruit and berries that you eat in a bowl of water with about a quarter cup of vinegar. Raspberries should soak for about four minutes while blueberries and strawberries should soak for about eight to ten minutes. That's because they get less soggy than raspberries do. Then after that take them out and give them a good rinse. Before you put them in the fridge let them dry. The vinegar also disinfects and kills the bacteria on the fruit. These bacteria also decompose the berries in the fruit. So by getting rid of them, you actually preserve the fruit for longer.
