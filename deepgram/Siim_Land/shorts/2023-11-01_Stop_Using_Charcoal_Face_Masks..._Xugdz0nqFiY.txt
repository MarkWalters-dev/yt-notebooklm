These popular skin cleaners actually make your skin worse. Coconut oil, because it's going to clog up your pores, which makes it much harder for your skin to breathe. As a result, you may end up getting blisters and pimples. Coconut oil is antibacterial so you could technically use it as a face wash, but you shouldn't keep it on your face for many hours. If you do want to use coconut oil to clean the bacteria on your face, then make sure you wash it off in a few minutes. Charcoal masks can also have negative side effects. Charcoal masks are quite intense and they can remove the dirt inside your skin pores but they can also cause damage to your healthy skin cells. When choosing a skin mask or skin cleaner, then make sure that it's not abrasive and harmful to your skin. The best skin cleanser that I've found is by Alatura Natural. Alitura uses only natural ingredient sourced and harvested from hawaii. Their products contain zero fillers which means that you could eat them without side effect.
