Shocking signs you have vitamin b twelve deficiency. No one seems to understand how big of a difference being deficient in vitamin b twelve actually makes. The last one took me by surprise. You should pay attention to things like your anxiety levels, your extremities and the color of your skin and your eyes. That's because vitamin b twelve deficiency can cause mood disorders and anxiety. You might also experience troubles concentrating and focusing. A very common sign of vitamin b twelve deficiency is chronic fatigue. This happens because you need b twelve to create red blood cells. Red blood cells help you to transport oxygen all around the body. If you suffer from b twelve deficiency then your homocysteine levels might also be high. Now this is actually very concerning because high homocysteine levels increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Another sign is abnormally white skin or yellow tint in your eyes. Vitamin b twelve deficiency can also cause nerve problems. For instance, if you feel numbness or tingling in your hands and fingers, you might be vitamin b twelve deficient.
