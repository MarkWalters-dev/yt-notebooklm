They found that people who climbed the stairs had an average 9% higher v two max than those who just walked. The stair climbers also had 24% higher incidence sensitivity, which is important for metabolic health. Stair climbers had about 8% lower blood pressure and 3.3% increased flow mediated dilation, which reflects good cardiovascular health. The researchers didn't find a lot of difference regarding inflammation and musculoskeletal markers but that's because it hasn't been investigated that much.
