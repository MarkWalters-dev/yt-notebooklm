Don't look at your phone at night. Let me explain. The artificial light can inhibit melatonin, the sleep hormone, which reduces the amount of healthy sleep you get. Even if you use screen filters or night mode, some of the flicker still gets through and it's gonna disrupt your melatonin production. The only safe way to look at your phone at night is with blue blocking glasses, but even then, it can prevent you from falling back asleep. If you look at the phone, you already psychologically associate the phone with social media being awake and entertainment. That's just gonna give your brain the signal that it's not time to sleep. So the best thing to do is to have your phone on airplane mode with a blue light filter and ideally don't look at it at all even with blue blocking glasses.
