Now you need about three grams of glycine for daily gluophan synthesis. Most people generally eat only around three to five grams of glycine from diet, and their body makes around three grams of glycine itself as well endogenously. So if you have the three grams the body makes itself and three grams usually people get from diet, then only three grams will be enough to cover the three gram demand for synthesizing creatine, glutathione, and heme by glycine. However, there's an additional requirement for twelve grams of glycine for collagen synthesis and collagen turnover. So if you're not really increasing your glycine intake or you're not eating a lot of glycine and you're not supplementing glycine for example, then you're almost at a 12 gram deficit in terms of glycine. That's why I think that supplementing some glycine and boosting the Gruathound with NAC as well is just such an easy combo to do. It has many benefits in terms of increasing your gluethon levels and managing inflammation levels.
