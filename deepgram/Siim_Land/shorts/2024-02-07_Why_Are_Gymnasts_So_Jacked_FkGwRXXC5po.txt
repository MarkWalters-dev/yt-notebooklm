Olympic gymnasts are one of the best athletes in the world. They do insane feats of strength and acrobatics that take years of practice to master, but they're also extremely muscular and shredded. Why do gymnasts look so jacked and how you can too? First of all, gymnasts train a lot of calisthenics. They do dozens of push ups, pull ups, dips, and other strength based movements that makes them build muscle. Gymnasts are masters of progressive overload by continuously challenging themselves with harder and harder movements. They start with regular pull ups, and eventually, they make it harder by doing ring pull ups and iron crosses on the ring, which require insane amounts of strength. Second of all, they train isometric straight arm exercises, such as the iron cross, planche, or front lever. These exercises are the biggest reason why the gymnasts have such big biceps. The isometrics are very powerful at building strength and muscle in the arms. Lastly, gymnasts have to stay very low body fat because otherwise, their exercises would be much harder. The combination of low body fat plus very high upper body strength is the reason why gymnasts look so jacked. Follow-up more.
