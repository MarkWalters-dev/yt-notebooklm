Vitamin d deficiency can be one of the worst things for your overall health. However, taking too much of vitamin d can also have some negative side effects. Too much vitamin d can cause hypercalcemia or too high calcium levels in the blood. This can lead to calcification, kidney stone formation, kidney failure, bone loss, and heart problems. Subjectively, you might feel numbness and tingling in your fingers and toes. The optimal vitamin d levels are between sixty to eighty nanograms per milliliter. It's very hard to get above 80 without supplementation. If you're above a hundred nanograms per milliliter, then just certainly stop supplementing vitamin d and stick to only natural sources like sunlight. Patients of lymphoma and granuloma forming disorders are more sensitive to vitamin d toxicity, so they have to pay more attention. Overall, be very careful with the supplements that you take if you don't know the side effects or how are they going to affect your blood work. Follow for more.
