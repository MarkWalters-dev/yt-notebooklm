Coffee consumption is associated with many health benefits, including a reduced risk of cancer. But which type of cancer? A new review looked at this, and they found that the cancer seem to be associated with reduced risk include skin or melanoma, liver, prostate, endometrial, breast, head, and neck, and colorectal cancer. Cancers associated with increased risk were lung cancer, but this might be because of smokers who drink coffee and smokers have the highest risk of lung cancer. Inconsistent or mixed results were seen for bladder cancer, central nervous system cancer, thyroid, mouth, esophageal, gastric cardia, kidney, ovarian, leukemia, myeloma, and lymphoma. These are based mostly on observational findings. But coffee consumption is very common among smokers which might explain the increased risk of lung cancer. Which means that although coffee appears to reduce the risk of all other types of cancers, it's not going to make up for smoking. Smoking is still so bad for you. Overall, drinking two to three cups of coffee per day is associated with a lot of health benefits such as reduced risk of heart disease, Alzheimer's, and all cause mortality. Follow for more.
