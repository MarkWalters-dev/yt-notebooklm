Your liver filters the blood from toxins and promotes detoxification. A dysfunctional liver promotes diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease. Here are the foods that damage your liver. Number one, alcohol. It's toxic to the human body, and your body can't use it for energy. That's why alcohol intake directly promotes liver damage and fatty liver. Alcohol related liver disease is a major cause of mortality independent of age. Number two, sugar sweetened beverages. Too much sugar promotes nonalcoholic fatty liver or fat accumulation around the liver. Soft drinks contain a lot of sugar and high fructose corn syrup, which damage liver in large amounts. Number three, ultra processed foods, such as fries, burgers, and cookies, are associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in a dose specific manner, meaning the more of these foods you eat, the higher the burden of liver disease. The reason is because of the high amounts of sugar and fat. Your liver is the only organ that can almost completely regenerate itself. You just need to stop consuming the foods that cause it damage.
