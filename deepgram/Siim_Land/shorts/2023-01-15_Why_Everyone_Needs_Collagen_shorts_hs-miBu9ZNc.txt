Starting at the age of 20, you start losing about 10% of your skin's collagen every decade. The density of collagen in the skin also drops starting at the age of 20 by about 8% per decade. Women actually have slightly less collagen than men at all ages, but both men and women see a decrease in skin collagen. So every adult needs some collagen to counteract this natural decline in collagen production and the degradation of collagen that happens from the lifestyle. Your body makes some collagen itself naturally but you do need all the precursors for that. And in most cases, many people aren't getting the precursors required to synthesize collagen themselves. The precursors that you want are lysine, hydroxyproline, proline, vitamin c, and copper.
