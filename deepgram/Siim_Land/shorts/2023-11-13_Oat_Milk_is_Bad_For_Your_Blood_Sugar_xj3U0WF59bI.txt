But if your average blood sugar level is elevated all the time, then at some point it might increase your risk of diabetes and insulin resistance. But there are ways to reduce this response. If you still like to drink oat milk, then just add some cinnamon, pectin, maybe m c two l as well to lower the glucose response. There are also other milk alternatives. If you're not lactose intolerant and you do drink dairy, then just use regular milk. If you wanna drink plant milk, then choose coconut milk or almond milk.
