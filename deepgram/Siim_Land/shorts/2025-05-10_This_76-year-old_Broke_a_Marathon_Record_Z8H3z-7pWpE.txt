Jeannie Rice is a 76 year old runner who set the marathon world record in her age group with a time of three hours thirty three minutes and twenty seven seconds. That's an average kilometer pace of five minutes and three seconds for 42 kilometers in a row. That's an insane time that most people in their twenties or thirties aren't able to match. They also did a study on Genie and found out her VO two max is 47.9 milliliters per kilogram per minute which is the highest ever for women aged 75 or older. To put it into perspective, a fit 30 year old woman is expected to have a VO2 max of around 48. An average 75 year old woman is expected to have a VO2 max of around 22, which is less than half of Genie's 47.9. This is remarkable, and it means a Genie is extremely fit, not only for her age, but for women of all ages. The scientists also looked at her maximum heart rate, which was a 180. That's also extraordinary and what an average 40 year old would have. At the age of 75, the average person's maximum heart rate is a 145 whereas Genie's is a 180. Genie is an inspiration and she shows that he is possible to stay forty years younger in terms of physical fitness, but she also trains a lot for this. Genie trains on average 70 to a 110 kilometers per week with 90% of training in moderate intensity below a 162 beats per minute, 9% in heavy intensity, and 1% in severe intensity. That's a lot of running, but you don't have to do that much. The most important takeaway is that if you keep exercising, you can stay healthy and fit well into your seventies, eighties, and nineties.
