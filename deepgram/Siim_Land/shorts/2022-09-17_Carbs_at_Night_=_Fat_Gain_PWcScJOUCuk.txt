Eat food, you eat your dinner, you go to bed soon, you're not going to exercise, you're not going to move. It makes sense in some way that, yeah, those carbs would be stored as fat if you're not going to burn them off. However, this is very like a myopic view on, like, you know, exercise carbs in carbs out, whatever. Whether or not you store carbs or calories overall depends on your calorie balance. If you're not overeating calories, you're in a calorie deficit or calorie maintenance, then even if you eat carbs at dinner, you're not going to store them as fat. The calorie balance is the overlying or the overarching reason why you stored those calories as fat.
