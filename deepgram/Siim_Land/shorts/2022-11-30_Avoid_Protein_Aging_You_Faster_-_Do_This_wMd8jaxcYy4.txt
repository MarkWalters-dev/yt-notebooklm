Methionine and excess methionine intake is the one that is also associated specifically with cancers and shorter lifespans. Whereas methionine restriction, consuming less methionine foods, is seen to have a positive effect on longevity and anti aging. However, this methionine restriction has been seen to work even without resupply methionine if you get enough glycine. So you need to balance your methionine intake with glycine, another non essential amino acid, to counterbalance the toxic effects of methionine.
