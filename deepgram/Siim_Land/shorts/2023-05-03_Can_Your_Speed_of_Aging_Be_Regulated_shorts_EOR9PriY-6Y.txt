It's important for people to really just appreciate the big picture here. There is a biology of aging. It is under genetic control and environmental control. We can modulate that. I think it's an open question how much we can modulate it. In other words, is there an upper limit? We can't get past that. That's an open question. Some people will say that the maximum achievable lifespan for a human is somewhere around 140 years. That remains to be determined, but it's clear that we can in fact modulate the biological aging process. We can dramatically affect health span, dramatically affect life span in every animal where we've tried in the laboratory. I just don't really see any rationale for why anybody would even argue that aging isn't genetically controlled. It clearly is.
