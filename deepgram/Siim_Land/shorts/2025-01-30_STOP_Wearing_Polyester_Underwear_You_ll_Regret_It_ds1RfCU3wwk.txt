Your underwear is secretly leaching billions of microplastics into your private parts. It's no wonder then that they find these microplastics in people's genitals now. Stop wearing underwear made from synthetic materials like polyester, nylon, pula meat, acrylic, elastane, spandex, and use natural materials like cotton, bamboo, hemp, and silk. Most underwear, especially the super stretchy ones, are full of synthetic materials that leach microplastics into your private parts. They also get through your skin and into the air that you breathe. Unfortunately, it also applies to yoga pants and leggings such as Lululemon, Under Armour, and every other popular sports brand. Because these microplastics are so microscopic, you end up breathing them in through the air, which is how they get into your brain. Yes, these microplastics can even get into your brain. Especially because you're sweating and heating up those areas, it makes it easier for the microplastics to detach from the material. The worst thing you could do is go to the sauna with your polyester underwear and you start sweating there. That's like asking for getting billions of microplastics into your testicles. Now go check your underwear and replace the polyester ones with more natural materials. Follow for more.
