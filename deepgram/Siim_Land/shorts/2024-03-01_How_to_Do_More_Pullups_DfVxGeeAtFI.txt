For my 20 birthday, I did 29 pull ups in one set. Pull ups are one of the best exercise for functional strength and building back muscles. Here's how to increase the amount of pull ups you can do. Number one, the most important thing is to practice pull ups frequently and do a lot of them. I've been training pull ups for over ten years almost every day. Because you're using your own body weight, you can train pull ups almost every day. Pull ups are not only about strength. There's also the skill component, which requires a lot of repetition. Number two, high volume training. If you want to do 30 pull ups in one set, then you need to build muscular endurance. This requires doing high amount of reps for multiple sets. Instead of maxing out every set you do, aim for about 70 to 80% of your maximum per set and repeat that for three rounds every other day. Number three, add the strength component. Being stronger still helps a lot. Pick a weight that you can do about five to six pull ups with and repeat it for three to four sets once a week. Trust me, weighted pull ups are one of the biggest game changers in terms of building a wider back and bigger biceps. Follow for more.
