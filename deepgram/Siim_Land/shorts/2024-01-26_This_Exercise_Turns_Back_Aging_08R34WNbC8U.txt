Losing your ability to move with age is quite upsetting. You're not able to run as fast or climb the stairs the same way you used to. You can't avoid it completely, but there is one form of exercise that can slow down physical aging. With age, you lose muscle mass and strength. However, the biggest thing you lose percentage wise is your fast twitch muscle fibers. These are the muscle fibers you use when sprinting or lifting something explosively. What you don't use, you lose. So sprinting is the most powerful exercise to slow down the loss of fast twitch muscle fibers. In our everyday life, we don't have to use our fast twitch muscle fibers, but that's the exact reason we lose them with age. So adding sprint workouts into your exercise routine can be one of the most powerful ways to slow down aging of your physical fitness. Sprinting also increases your VO two max, which is one of the biggest predictors of longevity. So never stop sprinting. Follow for more.
