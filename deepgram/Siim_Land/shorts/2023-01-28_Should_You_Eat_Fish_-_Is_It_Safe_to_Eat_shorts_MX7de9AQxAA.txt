Fish is one of the most amazing sources of protein in the world. It has healthy omega three fatty acids. It's high in protein. It has all the other vitamins and minerals you also need, and fish herring have a lot of creatine even more than beef. From the fish skin, you can actually get collagen and glycine, which is good for the skin itself. However, the fish of the world, most of them are also polluted with heavy metals from the sea from pollution. Excess fish consumption can cause heavy metal toxicity and increase your mercury levels too high, which can have negative side effects on your overall health. However, this applies generally to very large fish like swordfish and tuna that accumulate more of these heavy metals over their entire lifetime. But the smaller fish like herring, mackerel, and sardines generally have less of these heavy metals because they're smaller. Fish also contain many other minerals that are needed for the antioxidant defense system to work properly like glutathione that actually can counteract some of the negative side effects that you may get from heavy metal exposure. So all in all, I think that you should still consume some small amounts of fish in your diet, maybe not as the main source of your protein, but generally, I think it's worth it to consume these smaller types of fish.
