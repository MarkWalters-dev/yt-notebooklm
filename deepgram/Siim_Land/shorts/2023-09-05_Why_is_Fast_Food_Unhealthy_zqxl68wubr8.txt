Everyone knows that fast food is bad for you. But why does it taste so good? Fast food is very high in salt, sugar, and fat. Your body is hardwired to want to obtain these nutrients as much as possible, which is why you're more motivated to eat fast food. At the same time, fast food is also very low in protein and fiber, which are the most satiating nutrients. As a result, by eating fast food, you end up eating more while feeling less satiated. And because of this, you end up eating more calories, which makes you gain more weight. Fast food is also fried and cooked in oils which does make it taste better. It's nice and crispy but cooking oils in high temperatures is actually very bad for you. It increases inflammation and oxidizes the oils that is linked to many different kinds of diseases like diabetes, atherosclerosis, and heart disease. Of course, everything in moderation. But fast food is something that you want to avoid as much as possible because the way it's processed, it's cooked in high amounts of omega six fatty acid oils that cause a lot of inflammation in your body. But if you're ever at a fast food restaurant like McDonald's or KFC, then you can easily still find some healthier alternatives.
