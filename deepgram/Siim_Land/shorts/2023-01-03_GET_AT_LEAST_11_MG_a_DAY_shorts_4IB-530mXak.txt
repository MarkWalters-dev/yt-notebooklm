In this video, I wanna talk about what kind of foods have the highest amount of spermidine. This is a follow-up to my previous video about spermidine where I showed you that it is pretty interesting, longevity supplement that or compound even that is associated with some reduced mortality and just overall health. The biggest study, this 01/2018 study, higher spermidine intake is linked to lower mortality. Findings that they found were quite interesting that the cohort of people who consumed more than eleven point six milligrams of spermidine a day from glider sources, their overall mortality was, you know, up to thirty percent smaller compared to those who got less than nine point one milligram per day. If the study tells you anything, then it's gonna be that the amount of spermidine you want to get per day is at least eleven or twelve milligrams per day. The main reasons why spermidine may work in reducing mortality mortality has to do with primarily increasing pathology and mitology that is known to do that and other mechanisms are like increasing nitric oxide, reducing blood pressure, and just having a better overall health.
