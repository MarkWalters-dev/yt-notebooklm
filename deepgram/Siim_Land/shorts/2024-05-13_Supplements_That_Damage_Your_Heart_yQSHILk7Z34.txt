It's important to realize that supplements aren't regulated, and there are some supplements that can damage your heart. Number one is calcium. Calcium supplementation has been found to increase the risk of incident coronary artery calcification and cardiovascular disease mortality. Calcium supplements raise calcium levels in the blood too high which promotes arterial stiffness, spot coagulation, and calcification. Number two is ephedra which is a plant to use for weight loss. However, ephedra also raises blood pressure and heart rate which can cause arrhythmias. There are also case reports of ephedra causing coronary artery aneurysm and thrombosis. Number three, caffeine powder in large amounts can be fatal. Just one teaspoon or three grams of pure caffeine powder can be deadly. There are many cases of people accidentally overdosing on caffeine powder and dying to heart conditions because they miscalculated the dose. So it's very dangerous to use actual caffeine powder if you don't know the actual dose. Follow for more.
