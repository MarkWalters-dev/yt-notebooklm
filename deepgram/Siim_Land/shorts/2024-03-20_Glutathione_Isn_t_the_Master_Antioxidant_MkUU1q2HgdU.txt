Gluethon is often called the master antioxidant that has many health benefits. However, gluethon is regulated by two other important hormones. These two hormones are essential for vitality and longevity. I'm talking about vitamin d and melatonin. Vitamin d is a hormone that our body makes when our skin gets exposed to sunlight. Melatonin is the sleep hormone we produce in the absence of light. Melatonin and vitamin d have very similar hormonal effects, and they act like counter opposite light or darkness sensors. Both melatonin and vitamin d regulate gluothon, and higher levels of vitamin d are associated with higher gluothon status. So how do you make vitamin d? We already talked about it getting exposed to sunlight. Exposure to sunlight also helps your body to make melatonin at night, but it's more important to avoid bright lights in the evening and before bed because they suppress melatonin production. By doing this, you achieve an optimal balance in your immune function, hormones, and metabolism. Follow for more.
