Did you know that your canned beverage has plastic inside it? The lining inside a tin or aluminum can is plastic to prevent aluminum from leaching into the beverage. However, this means that the beverage will contain microplastics and nano plastics instead. If you remove the aluminum with acid, you can see the plastic liner. Now this is a good thing because you don't want the aluminum or tin leaching into the beverage or water, but it comes at a cost of more microplastics. You can't avoid all microplastics because they're everywhere. You don't need to. Just make smarter choices by replacing plastic bottles and cans with glass bottles. Instead of using tupperware, use glass tupperware. Instead of using Teflon nonstick pans, use a stainless steel one. Obviously, you can't always drink from a glass bottle but that's okay. It's not what you do 10% of the time that matters, but what you do the other 90% of the time that does. Follow for more.
