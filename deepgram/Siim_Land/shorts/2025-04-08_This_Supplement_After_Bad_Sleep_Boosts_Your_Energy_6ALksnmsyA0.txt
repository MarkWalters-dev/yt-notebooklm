If you got a bad night's sleep, take creatine. Here's why. In this 2011 study on athletes, taking a hundred milligrams per kilogram of creatine after sleeping three to five hours reversed the negative decline in skill performance. It had equal effects to one milligram per kilogram of caffeine. There's also a study where a single large dose of creatine like twenty eight grams reversed the decline in cognitive performance after twenty one hours of sleep deprivation. The reason creatine has those effects is because your brain uses a lot of creatine for energy. For supporting exercise and muscle development, you don't need any more than a hundred milligrams per kilogram of body weight, which is five to ten grams for most people. This amount will also maintain physical performance after sleep deprivation. But even larger amounts like twenty grams can help to stave off fatigue after prolonged sleep deprivation. You don't need to take twenty grams of creatine every day. A hundred milligrams per kilogram is enough. Too much creatine does reduce your sleep demand, and it can keep you up at night, which is why you shouldn't take it in the evening. Follow for more.
