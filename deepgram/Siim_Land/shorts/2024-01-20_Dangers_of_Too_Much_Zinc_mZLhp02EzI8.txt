Zinc is a very popular mineral used for increasing testosterone and boosting the immune system. Indeed, zinc has a very important role in the body. However, too much zinc can have some negative side effects. Excess zinc can cause an imbalance between copper. Zinc is a copper antagonist, which is why ingesting large doses of zinc can lead to copper deficiency by inhibiting its absorption and increasing copper secretion. A high concentration of zinc in the small intestine triggers the expression of metallothionines, which bind to copper. Copper is the most important mineral for making hemoglobin in the body. Low copper levels can cause anemia and malabsorption issues. Too high zinc and low copper also raises cholesterol levels, which can increase the risk of atherosclerosis. Thus, it's not recommended to take large amounts of zinc every day. The RDA for zinc is only eight to twelve milligrams, and you can easily achieve it with diet. The golden rule when supplementing zinc is that for every forty milligrams of zinc you take, you need one additional milligram of copper.
