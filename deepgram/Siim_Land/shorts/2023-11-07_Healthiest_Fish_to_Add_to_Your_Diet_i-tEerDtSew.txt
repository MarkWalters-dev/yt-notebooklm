Healthiest fish to add to your diet. So everyone has already heard that including fish in your diet is good for you. But which fish is the healthiest? People assume that salmon, the redfish, is healthiest. But that's not true. Most salmon is contaminated with heavy metals and other toxins because most of the seas in the world are polluted. Salmon is also quite expensive, whereas there are other much cheaper and healthier fish out there. The two healthiest fish you should add into your diet are sardines and herring. Sardines are a very small fish, so they accumulate very little heavy metals compared to bigger fish like tuna or swordfish. Sardines also have small bones that you can eat for the extra calcium and collagen. Herring is also a small fish that's low in heavy metals. It's actually the highest food source of creatine in the world and it's full of other essential minerals that support your body's antioxidant defense system. You can avoid heavy metals by eating smaller fish and choosing food options that keep you healthy.
