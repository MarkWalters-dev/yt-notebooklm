I've been missing out on the benefits of asteaxanthin without even knowing it. Azaxanthin is a carotenoid that makes salmon look pink. It has 6,000 times greater antioxidant capacity than vitamin c. As a supplement, there have been several recent meta analysis of randomized controlled trials that show how asteaxanthin lowers blood pressure, reduces markers of metabolic syndrome, and decreases human skin aging. That sounds all fine and dandy. However, a 2023 National Institute of Aging study saw that asteaxanthin extended the lifespan of mice by twelve percent. That doesn't sound like a lot, but very few supplements have actually been shown to extend lifespan in animals. Based on the evidence that I shared with you, I have added aaxanthin to my supplement routine. Nordcode just came out with their ultimate omega formula that contains a clinically relevant dose of aaxanthin. The ultimate omega formula is harvested from phytoplankton, which makes it low in contaminants and environmentally sustainable.
