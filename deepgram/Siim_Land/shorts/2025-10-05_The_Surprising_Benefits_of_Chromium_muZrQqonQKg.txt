Chromium, as well has a lot of evidence that it helps with blood sugar regulation, even cholesterol metabolism, and body composition, so weight loss and muscle growth, through increased insulin sensitivity. So chromium enhances insulin action on the cells. So where you have better blood sugar regulation and nutrient partitioning. So I've even taken chromium in the past as a bodybuilding supplement, hoping that it would help with muscle growth as there are some studies pointing in that direction. So I do think that it's a pretty good supplement.
