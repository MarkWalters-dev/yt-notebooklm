I'm never going to buy a non stick pan again after seeing your video on the dangers of Teflon. Are ceramic pans also dangerous? Non stick cookware is found in many kitchens across the entire world. The non stick coating is made of a chemical called Teflon. When heated to very high temperatures it can release toxic fumes into the food. Typically it's gonna happen at a temperature of 500 degrees Fahrenheit or 260 degrees Celsius. Inhaling these fumes can cause some health problems and fiber disorders. If you accidentally scratch the pan or overheat it, you run the risk of breathing in the chemicals. Thankfully ceramic pans are considered a healthier alternative because they're non stick. They don't have any chemicals on them. They're also made with a natural ceramic coating that doesn't release toxic fumes when heated. And they're much more environmentally friendly than Teflon. So throw away your Teflon and non stick pans and use natural ceramic pans.
