These are the three best foods to eat in the evening if you want a small snack. Number one. Cottage cheese with berries. The calcium in cottage cheese will help with REM sleep that improves your dreams. And the protein also satiate you for longer. Number two. Dark cherries and plums. These fruits are very high in melatonin which is the hormone that tells your body to sleep. Number three. Bananas. Bananas have potassium which is a mineral that helps with sleep quality and it's important for relaxation. Bananas also contain a small amount of carbohydrates that release serotonin, the relaxation neurotransmitter. And serotonin can actually be converted into melatonin. So before you grab a midnight snack, try to make a healthy food choice that improves your sleep instead.
