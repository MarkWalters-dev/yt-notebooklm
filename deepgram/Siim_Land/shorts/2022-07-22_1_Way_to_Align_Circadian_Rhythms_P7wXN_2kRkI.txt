To be aligned with the circadian rhythms allows your body to continuously produce LAD all the time especially during sleep every day and being misaligned with those circadian rhythms kind of shuts that off so you're not in that recycling mode anymore or at least it's greatly diminished. So, how do you achieve that? Well, obviously very simple in that sense that we need to just align our body circadian rhythms with the day and night cycles of the environment. And humans being diurnal creatures, we should be supposed to be awake at daytime and sleep at night.
