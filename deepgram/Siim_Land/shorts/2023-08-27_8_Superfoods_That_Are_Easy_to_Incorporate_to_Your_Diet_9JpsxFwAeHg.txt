If you want to improve your diet, then these eight superfoods are a game changer. The billion dollar diet industry doesn't want you to know about these foods. The eight superfoods you need to start eating are liver, olive oil, raw cacao, eggs, berries, herbs, garlic, and herring. The reason has to do with the fact that they're packed with vitamins and minerals and other nutrients. For example, olive oil, berries, and herbs are packed with antioxidants and polyphenols that improve your health and lower inflammation. Liver is nature's multivitamin as it contains virtually all the vitamins and minerals you need. Herring, on the other hand, has a lot of healthy omega three fatty acids and it's also the highest source of creatine. These superfoods will improve your diet but also reduce the risk of many chronic diseases. Now, let's say you're making a salad tomorrow. Just by adding some berries, herbs, olive oil and some eggs will make a huge difference.
