What happens to your body if you stop eating and consuming calories? Within the first four to six hours your blood sugar will drop to normal levels since your last meal. The liver breaks down stored glycogen in the liver called glycogen to maintain normal blood sugar for the next ten to twelve hours. After about twelve hours of not eating, your liver glycogen stores will be low and the body then starts using more fat for energy production. This is characterized by the rise in ketone bodies which are produced from fatty acids. After twenty four hours, your body is running on purely body fat by converting body fat into ketone bodies. However, the body still needs some amount of glucose, which is why the liver breaks down amino acids from muscle protein into glucose via a process called gluconeogenesis. From twenty four hours onward, gluconeogenesis rises and reaches its peak at about three days of not eating. After twenty four hours, you also see an increase in growth hormone, which signals the body to reduce protein breakdown and increase fat burning. After thirty six hours, autophagy rises significantly, which is a process of cell cleanup. Autophagy breaks down broken, worn out, and dysfunctional cell components and mitochondria to be used for energy. The longer you don't eat, the more weight you will lose, but this is not always healthy nor sustainable. You will have to eat at some point, and that's why it's important to have a meal plan that you can follow sustainably without needing to crash diet or starve yourself. Try to eat minimally processed foods, practice portion control, and incorporate regular physical activity into your life. Follow for more.
