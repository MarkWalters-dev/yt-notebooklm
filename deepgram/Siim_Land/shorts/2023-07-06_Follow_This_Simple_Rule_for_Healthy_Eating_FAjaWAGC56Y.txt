Meal planning isn't rocket science, but it's a no brainer. First, ask yourself what kind of foods should I buy and what kind of foods should be in my pantry? How do I personally structure my meals? I aim for around 30 to 50 grams of protein per meal, which is the equivalent of around four to eight ounces of a specific type of protein like chicken, fish, or eggs. And then I add some vegetables as well as some starchy carbohydrates. So a typical meal for me will look like this, a protein source like eggs, fish, cottage, cheese, or beans, some vegetables like broccoli or cauliflower, and the starchy carbohydrates for me usually are potatoes. Hope this helps, and let me know in the comments how do you structure your meals.
