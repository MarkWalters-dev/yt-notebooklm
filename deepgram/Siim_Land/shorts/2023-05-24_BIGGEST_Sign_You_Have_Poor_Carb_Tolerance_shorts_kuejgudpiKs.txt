And the postprandial glucose is a stronger predictor of cardiovascular events than just the fasting glucose in type two diabetes. So if you were to take the oral glucose tolerance test, which involves consuming the seventy five grams of glucose in a drink and measure your blood sugar levels to hours and if your blood sugar levels are over 140 milligrams per deciliter then that's a sign that first of all you have impaired glucose tolerance, you're at a risk of diabetes and at the same time you are also contributing to atherosclerosis progression and increasing the risk of heart disease. If you're a healthy and fit individual with adequate insulin sensitivity and good glucose tolerance then you shouldn't stay that high after two hours. Normally, you would want to stay around 100 which is still considered quite normal.
