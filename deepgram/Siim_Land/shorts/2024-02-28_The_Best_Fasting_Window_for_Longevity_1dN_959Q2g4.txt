Intermittent fasting is said to have longevity benefits. We don't know if it will actually extend your life, but there's plenty of research showing that intermittent fasting helps with weight loss, blood sugar, blood pressure, inflammation, and other risk factors for chronic diseases. But what's the best intermittent fasting window for longevity? There are a few things you have to keep in mind. Number one, are you getting enough protein and are you able to build muscle? If your fasting window makes you lose muscle, then that's a net negative because muscle is associated with greater longevity. It's recommended to get at least two protein meals per day with at least 50 to 100 grams of protein in each meal. In total, you want to aim for 1.6 grams per kilogram of protein per day. Number two, you have to respect the circadian rhythm. Misalignments in these rhythms are linked to many diseases. That's why it's healthier to not eat too late in the evening. Most people skip breakfast and have lunch and dinner. That's fine, and the research suggests there's no big difference between early and late time mosquito eating. However, you should stop eating about three to four hours before bed or for more.
