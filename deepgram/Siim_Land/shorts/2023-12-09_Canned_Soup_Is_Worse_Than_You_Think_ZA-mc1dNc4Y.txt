Canned soup is worse than you think. A randomized crossover trial found that people consuming one serving of canned soup over the course of five days saw a 1200% increase in their urinary levels of BPA. BPA is a common xenoestrogen used in plastic products, but it's also used as coating of cans. When canned food is inside the can, over time, the BPA leaches into the food. Xenoestrogens like BPA mimic estrogen inside your body and can cause hormonal disruption and other health problems, especially in children. They can also cause fertility issues and reduce sperm quality in men. Xenoestrogens are in almost all everyday products, so you can't fully avoid them. Just be aware of their presence and use safer alternatives where you can. For example, instead of eating canned soup, you can easily buy premade soup inside a glass jar. Follow for more.
