The research does show that, the heavy compound lifts with barbells generally produce more of a hormonal response than isolation exercises and machines. So yeah, barbell squats, deadlifts, bench press, overhead press, rows, pull ups even, those will elicit a bigger growth hormone as well as testosterone response. On the rep side shows that the heavier reps a little bit, three to six reps probably, all of those will have that effect eight reps at max. And the load should be still, you know, something that you can only lift for five times and that usually would have to entail that the weight is like 80% of your one rep max.
