You've heard many people criticize innovative fasting because it can cause muscle loss. But is it true? I've been doing innovative fasting for the last ten years, and I've never experienced muscle loss directly due to innovative fasting that wasn't caused by calorie restriction. That could happen on any diet and on any eating frequency. A 2021 systematic review on 23 randomized and non randomized controlled trials found that time restricted eating can reduce body mass and improve nutrient metabolism in both normal and overweight individuals, but it doesn't alter protein synthesis and muscle mass. A 2022 study compared the effects of continuous 20% calorie restriction combined with resistance training and five two intermittent fasting combined with resistance training for twelve weeks. They saw no significant differences in body composition, muscle quality, and strength. That's because both groups ate over 1.4 grams per kilogram per day of protein. So if your protein intake and resistance training are the same, then fasting inherently isn't going to cause muscle loss. Follow for more.
