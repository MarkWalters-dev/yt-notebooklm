Turmeric or curcumin. There's quite a lot of, human clinical trials for inflammation mostly. So I'll put it in the gut tier. Now you could also get turmeric from just, the spice. So, not taken as a supplement. The problem with turmeric is that it's very poorly bioavailable. So even supplements tend to have pretty bad bioavailability. And, that's why it's better to use something like liposomal formulations or or, with added bipyrin piperine. That's black pepper that increases the bioavailability of turmeric.
