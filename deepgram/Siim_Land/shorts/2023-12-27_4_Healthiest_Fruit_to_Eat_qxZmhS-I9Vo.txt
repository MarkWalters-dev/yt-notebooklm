Some people say fruit is unhealthy, but that's not the case. Eating up to two servings of fruit today is associated with the lowest risk of all cause mortality. But which fruit is the healthiest? Number one, kiwis are great for vitamin c and vitamin e, but also a good source of carotenoids such as lutein, zeaxanthin, and beta carotene, which support eye health. Eating kiwis before bed has also been shown to improve sleep quality, sleep onset, sleep duration, and sleep efficiency. Number two, olives. Yes. Olives are still a fruit, but they taste salty. That's because olives are packed with polyphenols and healthy fats that have been shown to improve heart health and inflammation status. Olive oil consumption at doses up to twenty grams a day is linked to lower risk of heart disease and all cause mortality. Number three, apples. Apples are a great low sugar fruit with a lot of prebiotic fiber and vitamin c. Apples contain a compound called pectin that's been shown to improve blood sugar inflammation and digestion. Number four, grapefruit is quite sour and bitter, but it tastes great. Grapefruit also contains inositol, which is a type of sugar that improves insulin sensitivity. Follow for more.
