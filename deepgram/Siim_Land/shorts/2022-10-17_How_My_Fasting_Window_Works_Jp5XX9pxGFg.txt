What do you notice helps you perform better physically? I do you know, fasting, I eat one meal a day, but I also have a protein shake with amino acids and, like, creatine and other things, before the workout. And the you know, I've tried regular one meal a day as well, and that's definitely not enough to build muscle or get stronger. So you're you're lacking, like, this, additional protein synthesis, that you would get from adding a meal. So I'll just add protein shake out of convenience and simplicity before the workout, and that has worked, really good for me because I'm fasting. I get this surge in growth hormone and deeper ketosis and autologize that helps to kind of increase the fat burning and makes the body more metabolically flexible, and it also increases insulin sensitivity a lot.
