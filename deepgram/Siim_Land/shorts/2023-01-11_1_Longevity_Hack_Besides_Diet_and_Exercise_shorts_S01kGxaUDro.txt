Other than working out and eating well, number one longevity hack. So obviously sleep, take care of sleep, sleep at least eight hours. I think more upper end of eight hours is more beneficial. But let's say that's not that's also included there. Let's say I would then say regular sauna who's taking a sauna four times a week. That's gonna reduce your old cause mortality by up to forty percent. Which is great. And it also has protective effects on heart disease, Alzheimer's, depression and many other things. So I think the sauna. The next best thing after exercise, sleeping and eating well.
