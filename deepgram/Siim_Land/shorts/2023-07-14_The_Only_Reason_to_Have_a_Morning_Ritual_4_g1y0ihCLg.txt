Here's the big problem with morning routines no one talks about. I used to think that morning routines were super important because they set the entire rhythm for the entire day. Then I realized that it's something many people, including myself might overly rely on. For example, if you miss the cold shower or if you miss the meditation then you're not able to be productive for the entire day because you feel like something is missing. If you want to achieve higher productivity without being dependent of anything, the only most important routine that you really need in the morning is to get exposed to bright daylight. These circadian rhythms inside your body are connected to the day and night cycles of the environment and they work whether or not you like it or not. It's also very beneficial to do some movement and taking a cold shower or journaling but you definitely don't want to overly rely on them to be productive. So yes, if you do follow some morning routines then go ahead, but you should also practice going without the morning routines to maintain more flexibility and freedom.
