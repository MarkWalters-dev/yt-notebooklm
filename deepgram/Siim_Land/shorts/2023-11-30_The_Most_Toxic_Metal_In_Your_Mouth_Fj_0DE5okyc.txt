50% of that black silver filling that you might have in your mouth is mercury, and mercury is still the most toxic non radioactive element known to men. And if they're in your mouth, it's a daily process of intoxicating you with that mercury. If it gets into your nervous system, there are enzymes, catalases, that make the mercury stick for sixteen to thirty two years half life, which is really bad. So always first things first, get rid of that amalgam filling. But big, big, big caveat, don't just go to any dentist and tell them, I want that nasty silver amalgam filling out of my mouth. Why? Because they will just drill it out, and drilling out an amalgam filling without proper protection causes way more of the toxic mercury vapor to leach out. I've seen thousands of my patients developing chronic health issues after such a thing, so therefore, don't freak out. All the things I'm telling you here right now is just more information to plan ahead to see, okay, there is a mercury filling. Where can I find a dentist who knows how to remove amalgam safely?
