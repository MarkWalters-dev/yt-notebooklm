Don't think it's controversial. It's it's a fact that some people don't like that resveratrol is the most debunked longevity molecule ever. Yeah. Resveratrol does not increase lifespan in laboratory animals on average. There's been a meta analysis. It's not even my data of, like, 50 or 60 studies, and the average effect is zero. I'm sorry. That's a fact. If people don't like it, too bad. So, you know, it's just reality. Right. And yet you still hear certain influencers out there pedal the nonsense that resveratrol isn't is a longevity drug or anti aging drug. Other than that, I don't have super strong opinions on most supplements other than I tend to be maybe more skeptical or less enthusiastic than than other people out there. My view is unless you have a very, very good rationale and hopefully a good understanding of the the biology that you're perturbing, the likelihood you're gonna get a better outcome is less than the likelihood you're gonna get a worse outcome.
