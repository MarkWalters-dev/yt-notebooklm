Melatonin is the number one antiaging hormone in my opinion because, you know, it's part of the circadian rhythm. It's part of many other things as well in the body. Like, it is a master or very powerful antioxidant. It, produces, different kinds of processes or regulates these, like autophagy, apoptosis, detoxification, growth hormone release, and many things are connected to the natural production of melatonin. To get older, you produce less melatonin, which is, you know, problematic for both the circadian rhythm alignment as well as sleep quality and all the other antiaging processes that occur.
