Berries are one of the healthiest things you can eat. Here's a list of the healthiest berries you can eat. Number one, strawberries. Strawberries taste amazing and they're high in anthocyanins, which are compounds that have heart, brain, and eye health benefits. Strawberries also contain fisetin, which is a senolytic, meaning it helps to remove senescent zombie cells inside your body. Number two, blueberries are also very tasty and high in anthocyanins. In one study, drinking blueberry juice daily improved memory in older people. Blueberries also contain quercetin, which is another senolytic compound. Number three, cranberries. They are a bit sour, but that actually makes them very good for the liver and kidneys. Cranberry extract has been shown to improve lipid profile, insulin resistance, and fatty liver. Many human studies find that cranberries help to prevent urinary tract infections. Number four, cherries. Cherries are high in melatonin, which is a powerful antioxidant. Cherries can thus help with sleep and inflammation levels. Eating foods with melatonin like cherries has been seen to be associated with reduced risk of all cause mortality.
