You take like any sleep supplements, magnesium, melatonin? Yeah. Before bed, I end up taking, magnesium threonate. My favorite though is tart cherry juice. Yeah. Really seems to help me stay asleep. I have no problem going to sleep. My problem is I wake up in the middle of the night and then I can't go back to bed. But if I do a shot of tart cherry juice, I can sleep straight through the night. Now, if I just do melatonin, it'll wake me up at 4AM and then I'm wide awake and I can't go back to sleep Mhmm. And it might help the first night, but then the second night, no. I'm in wide awake from the start. Yeah. So but for some reason, tart cherry juice just seems to work. Yeah. There is it has, like, a lot of melatonin and, powerful antioxidant. I think that your your gut produces melatonin, you know, with the tart cherry juice, so it helps to produce your own endogenous Yeah. Supply.
