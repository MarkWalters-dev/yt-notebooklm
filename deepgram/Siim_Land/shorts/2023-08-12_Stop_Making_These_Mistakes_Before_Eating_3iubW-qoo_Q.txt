Do you eat healthy but you don't see any result? This might be the reason why. If you don't pay attention to what you do before eating, you might be harming your health. Before you eat, you need to eliminate stress and distraction. Being present and paying attention to what you eat is key. Being distracted and eating on the run is a huge mistake. Being present while you're eating improves your digestion and it also prepares the gut to absorb the nutrients that you eat. On the other hand, being stressed out and distracted while you're eating reduces the production of stomach acid. This can lead to digestive issues and bloating. Imagine having digestive issues every time you eat and now imagine benefiting from every nutrient every time you eat. Which one sounds better?
