Breakfast cereal dominates the aisles of the supermarket. But don't fall into this trap. Here's what to feed your kids instead of sugary cereal. Popular kids cereal are full of sugar, artificial colors and synthetic vitamins which can increase the risk of obesity and diabetes. But there are plenty of high protein cereal alternatives. For example, Crump Granola. Crump is a granola mix that I help to create. It's packed with protein and fiber while being low carb. It's also important to find cereals with no added sugars. If your kid craves the sugary taste, then you can add some berries or glycine which is an amino acid with a sweet taste. The fact is that kids like cereal and things that taste sweet, so parents need to find some compromises and better alternatives.
