Atherosclerosis or the plaque buildup in your arteries is one of the main drivers of heart disease. However, there are some over the counter supplements that have also been shown to reduce plaque buildup. Number one, aged garlic extract has been shown to lower coronary artery calcification scores in randomized clinical trials. Number two, nattokinase. A 2022 study found that nattokinase supplementation at a dose of ten thousand eight hundred fibrinolytic units a day showed significant reductions in the thickness of the carotid artery intima media and the size of the carotid plaque by 66.5 to 95.4%. The dose of three thousand six hundred fibrinolytic units a day was found to be ineffective. Number three, berberine. A A 2021 study on 21 patients with atherosclerosis found that berberine supplementation five hundred milligrams a day for four months resulted in a three point two percent average decrease in PACS score. Remember, none of these supplements should replace conventional therapies, but they could be effective in reducing risk in otherwise healthy people.
