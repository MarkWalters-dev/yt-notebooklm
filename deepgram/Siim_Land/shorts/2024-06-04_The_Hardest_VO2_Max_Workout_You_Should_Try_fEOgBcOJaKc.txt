A higher VO two max is one of the biggest predictors of longevity. To increase your VO two max, you need to do a lot of cardio. However, there's one high intensity interval workout that's very effective for increasing VO two max. It's called the Norwegian protocol. Here's how it looks like. First, you warm up for four minutes at 60 to 70% of your maximum heart rate. Then you run as fast as you can for four minutes at 85 to 95%. Then you slow down again to 60 to 70% for four minutes and you repeat it for four rounds. In total, it takes you thirty two minutes. And finally, you cool down for four minutes at less than 60% maximum heart rate. Do this once a week and your VO two max will increase. Follow for more.
