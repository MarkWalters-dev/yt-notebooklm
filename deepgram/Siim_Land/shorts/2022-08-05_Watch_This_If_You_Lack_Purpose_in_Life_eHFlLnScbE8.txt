It kinda goes back to trying to make the world a better place, trying to leave the world better than you found it before. First of all, improving yourself, taking care of yourself, making sure that you're healthy and that you're optimized and that you're in a perfect spot where you can help others because you can't help others if you can't help yourself or if you haven't helped yourself first. You can't expect others to change if you don't change for the better. You can't expect others to be better. If you're not better, you can't expect the world to be better. If you're not better, be the best version of yourself and then try to help others achieve that and then kind of transform the world around you to be better.
