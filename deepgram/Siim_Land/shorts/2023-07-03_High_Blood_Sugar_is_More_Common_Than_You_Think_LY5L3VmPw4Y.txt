Even if you're not worried about diabetes, you still want to watch this video. There's no real problems with having a piece of cake or drinking a little bit of Coca Cola every once in a while. But if you're an average person and you do this multiple times a day, then it is a bigger deal than you think. Chronically elevated blood sugar levels can damage the blood vessels and promote atherogenesis and calcification. There's also the danger of wearing out your pancreas that produces insulin. Insulin is the key hormone that actually helps to lower your blood sugar levels but if your cells become insulin resistant then you either don't produce enough insulin to satisfy the demand or the cells become tone deaf to the actions of insulin and thus your blood sugar levels stay elevated for longer. So if you are eating a lot of carbohydrates then you definitely want to make sure that you don't have prediabetes or full blown diabetes.
