Let's go back to magnesium. Magnesium is driven into the cell, as well as potassium from insulin. So if you're insulin resistant, you are also typically magnesium deficient at the cellular level because you have a lower amount of magnesium and potassium going into the cell. Elevated insulin levels also increase the urinary excretion of magnesium. You'll see type two diabetics, they'll have an elevated urinary magnesium, but their ionic magnesium, which is the activated form, is down in the blood. So typically fifty percent of type two diabetics are magnesium deficient, so they're not activating their thiamine as well. And so they're not able to burn their glucose appropriately, which also elevates lactic acid and leads to tissue and basically this acute in certain tissues, ischemia as well. So you can literally have poor glucose metabolism causing oxidative stress, tissue ischemia, buildup of lactic acid. It's just a mess when your body doesn't have the nutrients to allow the metabolic engine to
