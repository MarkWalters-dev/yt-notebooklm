If you are consuming less than zero point one five milligrams of thiamine per day, that leads to pre diabetes and type two diabetic glucose curves. And the reason is because thiamine sits at the top of glucose metabolism. So in order to oxidize glucose, you've got to go through glycolysis that can literally induce type two diabetes or pre diabetes. We don't store a lot of thiamine. This is the key. We only store about thirty milligrams. So you can become rapidly depleted in all of your thiamine stores within days, just being sick, If you have an infection, inflammation, when you are more physically active, your thiamine requirements dramatically skyrocket. And then anything like even diarrhea, drinking coffee or tea close to your intake of foods have basically polyphenols and things that will inactivate thiamine, but also reduce the absorption of thiamine.
