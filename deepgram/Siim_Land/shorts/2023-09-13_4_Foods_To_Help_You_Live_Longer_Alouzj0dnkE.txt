Boosting your longevity doesn't have to be expensive. Here are four foods that I eat every day that have been proven to promote longevity. Number one is coffee. You might have heard that coffee is bad for your health, but actually, moderate coffee consumption is linked to reduced mortality and reduced risk of chronic diseases. The lowest risk appears to be between two to three cups of coffee a day, but I personally drink one to two cups a day. Number two is olive oil. Olive oil contains a lot of polyphenols and antioxidants that improve your lipid profile and blood sugar regulation. I usually like to mix olive oil with my different meals. I use it as salad dressing and mix it together with different kinds of vegetables and fish like herring or salmon for the extra omega three's. Number three is eggs. Eggs contain choline which is an important nutrient for preventing neurodegeneration and improving liver health. Number four is krump. Krump is my plant based mince made of hemp and pea protein. It's very high in protein, fiber, and magnesium. Follow my daily diet and you'll easily improve your health.
