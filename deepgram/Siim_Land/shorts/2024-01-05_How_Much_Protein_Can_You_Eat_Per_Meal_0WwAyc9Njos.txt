Nutritionists have been saying for years that you can absorb only 20 to 30 grams of protein per meal. However, there's been a brand new study that challenges this idea. The study was called the allyloid response to protein ingestion during recovery from exercise has no upper limit in magnitude and duration. They found that after resistance training, a very large protein intake of 100 grams results in a larger and longer over twelve hour anabolic response compared to a low protein intake of only 25 grams. Previously, it was thought that only 30 to 40 grams of protein maximizes protein synthesis, and everything else would be redundant, even wasted. However, this study found that the much larger amounts actually do better. This also confers my own experience. For the last six to eight years, I've had only two protein injections per day, thirty grams before training and over a 100 grams after training. I've never had problems with maintaining or putting on muscle. In fact, I went from seventy to eighty five kilograms using this approach or for more.
