When I was in the military this was my physique, about sixty eight kilograms or something like that. And this on the right is my last year's progress pic when I was 26 years old when I've been doing one meal a day for five years and I weighed about eighty four kilograms. But what I did realize was that, building muscle with one meal a day is very difficult, it's very slow and that was a problem that I was also experiencing throughout my journey. There were periods where I ate strictly only one meal a day with no additional calories during daytime and that was yet where I didn't see like any progress in terms of muscle hypertrophy and even strength was very slow to develop. At that point, I developed my own protocol which I call a targeted intermittent fasting and it's a form of basically one meal a day where you have basically this fast window, you fast the majority of the day. You still eat one meal a day with the majority of the calories there. I usually have like one big main course and some other smaller meals in the next to that. But during daytime, I do have like a protein shake during the fasted window usually into workout or immediately before the workout.
