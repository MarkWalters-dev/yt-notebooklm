These are the most dangerous skin care products in the world. Many skin care products like Dior, L'Oreal, and Wella contain phthalates. Phthalates are chemicals that make the product more plastic. Phthalates are also xenoestrogen that disrupt your hormones and fertility. They can increase your estrogen levels that causes estrogen dominance and weight gain. This actually makes your skin look worse. Brands like Neutrogena Clinique and La Roche Posay contain oxybenzone which is used in sunscreen and different kind of products as a stabilizer. However, oxybenzone also cause skin irritation, redness, and hormone disruption. Some studies even find that oxybenzone increases the risk of breast cancer. It's important to avoid these ingredients and opt for more natural options. Ideally, they should be food grade meaning that you should be able to eat them without side effects.
