I've been doing red light therapy for seven years, and here's what I've experienced. First, red light therapy has been amazing for my skin health. It stimulates collagen synthesis in the skin thanks to the red wavelengths of light that penetrate into the tissue. A 2023 study found that red light therapy was able to reverse signs of skin aging. Red light therapy also increases hyaluronic acid and elastin in the skin which supports skin elasticity. From my own personal experience, red light therapy does make my skin more shine. Every time I do it, I feel better and I sleep better. If you are buying these devices, then you have to be careful with the specific wavelengths of light that they use because otherwise, it's not gonna work. The correct wavelengths of light used in research are 630 to 660 nanometers for the red light and 800 to 950 for near infrared light.
