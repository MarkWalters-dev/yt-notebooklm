Many people teach themselves how to work out, but deadlifting should be approached with caution. Trying to deadlift heavy weights without proper technique can be dangerous, and it can lead to some serious injuries. Here's how to make sure you're safe. A deadlift with proper form can be one of the best exercises for strengthening your back and your legs. Where things go wrong is when people start adding too much weight and they lift with poor form. Learn the technique properly and don't ego lift. Never pull with a crooked back or rounded upper back. Try to keep a neutral spine at all times. If you learn the proper technique, then the deadlift can be an amazing exercise for strengthening your back, but use this exercise cautiously.
