What is causing those DNA markers to go bad? There's the camp that suggests that aging is kind of random damage, extra oxidative stress breaking things down, toxin exposures, etcetera. Proteins are no longer folding correctly. This physiologic deterioration is occurring, I guess, just really for lack of a better word, just somewhat randomly or unpredictable, depending on the environmental exposures you've experienced over your life. And actually, I should say that a lot of this scientists recognize that the aging phenomena does appear to originate in the epigenome. So if you want to talk about root cause aging, we sometimes talk about in functional medicine root causes of disease. We can say the root cause of aging appears to be housed in epigenetic changes. So the camp thinks that it's a random breakdown, but then there are those of us who really think there's a program phenomena. So there's program mortality built in, and these chronic diseases of aging are part of the program to prompt death within a certain window.
