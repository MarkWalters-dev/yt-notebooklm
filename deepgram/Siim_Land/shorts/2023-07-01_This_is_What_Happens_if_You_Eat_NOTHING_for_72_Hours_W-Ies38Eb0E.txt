This is what happens if you stop eating for seven to two hours. When you eat something, you absorb the calories and nutrients from your food. This will turn on the body's pathways for growth. When you're fasting, you stimulate the pathways of breakdown. First, you start breaking down the liver's glycogen, then body fat and eventually muscle tissue. The more physically active you are, the more calories you need. Eventually, you will tap into your body's body fat stores, especially after the twenty four hour mark. After a certain point, you elevate what's called autophagy or self eating. Autophagy starts to recycle different kinds of cellular debris and junk material inside the cells. So by the time you haven't eaten anything for seventy two hours, you will have put a lot of energy demands on your body and you will have burned through a lot of calories especially body fat as well. But if you do it for too long then you will eventually also tap into your muscle tissue stores which might be counterproductive in the long term, so you need to be careful with how long you fast and whether or not it supports your goals.
