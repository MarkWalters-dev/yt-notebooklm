Longevity gurus say that you need to eat expensive foods to stay healthy, but that's not true. This is what I eat in a day for my longevity. I like to start with green tea in the morning. It's a good source of antioxidants and it's low in caffeine. I also like to have some whey protein before my workouts to support the muscle growth. I might add a piece of fruit like a banana, an apple or some berries for some quick carbohydrates. For the skin antiaging benefits, I like to add some collagen in there. Eggs are another incredible source of protein that is very cheap. Herring is the number one source of creatine. It's high in omega three fatty acids but low in heavy metals. For plant based proteins, I like to eat krump which is a food product that I help to create. It's made of hemp flour and pea protein flour and it's very high in protein. I usually have some carbohydrates with some protein. In most cases, it's gonna be potatoes with a little bit of meat or krump. I think it's also important to add vegetables like carrots, broccoli, or beetroot because they contain a lot of antioxidants and fiber that help to improve your digestion.
