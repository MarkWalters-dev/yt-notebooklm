There are very few supplements that actually have longevity benefits. There's actually one supplement that's been repeatedly shown to reverse the whole month of aging in humans. It's called glynaq or glycine plus n a c. A 2023 clinical trial saw that sixteen weeks of supplementing with glynaq in older adults improved gluathione deficiency, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, physical function, and the seven hallmarks of aging. Multiple other trials from 2021 and 2022 have seen similar results. Glynaq improves inflammation, insulin resistance, walking speed, grip strength, and cognition. The way Glynac works is by increasing glutathione. Gluathione levels go down with age, and supplementing Glynac helps to bring it back up again. Both glycine and NSC are precursors to glutathione. You can't make glutathione without them. Gluethon has neuro, hepato, and cardioprotective effects. Whether or not glyniac is going to have the same effects in younger adults, we don't know. But glyniac certainly appears to be very effective in people who suffer from chronic stress or inflammation or if they are very old. Follow for more.
