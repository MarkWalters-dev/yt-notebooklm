Your teeth are tiny little organs connected to your brain through the nervous system. Poor oral health can lead to systematic poor health and vice versa. Here are the foods that damage your teeth. Number one, sugar is known to cause tooth decay. Sugar is bad for the teeth because it's acidic, and it feeds cavity promoting bacteria. Many foods contain added sugar, not just cookies and candy. You can even get sugar from processed meats, sauces, and cereal. Try to minimize your sugar consumption because it's not only bad for your teeth, but bad for your overall health. Number two, diet sodas. Regular sugar sweetened beverages are bad, we know. But diet sodas may also erode tooth enamel because they contain citric acid. Holding or swishing the soda in your mouth is particularly bad, so you should use a straw or not keep the soda in your mouth for long. Number three, processed carbohydrates like potato chips and white bread increase the risk of cavities. They also feed enamel eroding bacteria. Number four, fruit juices, especially orange juice. One 2016 study found that apple juice and orange juice were about five times more erosive than Coca Cola Lite.
