I wake up around 6AM and the first thing I do is take my dog out. It's actually amazing as the sunrise is going to help with anchoring my body's circadian rhythms to the morning. Then I have a cup of tea or coffee and start working on my computer. I work for about three to four hours and at 11AM I have my pre workout drink. It's 30 grams of whey protein, 10 of collagen, and some dark chocolate. After that, I have a workout at 1PM for about an hour. Sometimes it's weights or calisthenics, at other times it's cardio. After my workout, I take a sauna or use the infrared sauna blanket. It's amazing for recovery and it's been shown to also have benefits on the cardiovascular system and brain. I love it and I do it pretty much every day. Code seem at buncharge.com for a 15% discount. At 5PM, I have dinner which is some protein with potatoes and vegetables. And at 9PM, I start winding down for sleep and I'm asleep by 10PM.
