Looking chubby on the cheeks makes you look overweight. Having a leaner and more chiseled face is generally considered more attractive. Here's how to lose fat around the face and cheeks to bring out that jawline. The first thing you obviously need to do is lose weight overall. If you are 10, then your face will look more chubby. That's just the truth. By becoming leaner, your face will automatically look more chiseled. You'll lose the double chin, the chubby cheeks, and the round jawline. Eat about 500 fewer calories every day and incorporate exercise. Resistance training specifically can help to create a more defined jawline, not only because of the weight loss, but also because of the increase in testosterone and growth hormone. These hormones are what promote the definition of the jawline and cheeks. Lifting heavier weights, like with strength training, has the biggest effect on this. Third, doing face yoga exercises can help to lose water weight in the face and make you look less puffy. By stimulating the lymph flow in the face, you can iron out some wrinkles and make your face more defined. Lastly, get enough sleep because not sleeping enough can make your face look inflamed. Fall off more.
