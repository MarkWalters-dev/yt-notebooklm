If your toilet paper is white as snow, it's bad for your health and hormones. Let me explain. Toilet paper is made of wood, which is a completely natural ingredient and it's safe. But did you know that almost all toilet papers have added bleaches and fragrances? These chemicals contain xenoestrogens that have a negative effect on your hormones, your fertility, and reproductive health. And that's also the reason why toilet paper looks white as snow. It's bleached and colored white. When you're using the bleached toilet paper to wipe, you're absorbing a lot of the bleach and the xenoestrogens through your sensitive parts. Unbleached toilet paper in its natural form looks yellow and a little bit of gray. That's how you know it's safe and free from bleach. So the next time you're buying toilet paper, the safer option is to choose the toilet paper that looks more yellow or gray and the best thing about it, the unbleached toilet paper that does look a little yellow or gray is actually cheaper. The bleached toilet paper looks white and more clean, but it's actually much worse for your health.
