The tobacco industry is saying that vaping is safe. What they don't say is that you're still increasing your risk of asthma, lung injury, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is considered to be somewhat safer than regular smoking because the vape contains less toxins than regular smoke. The Royal College of General Practitioners from England has stated that ecigarettes are unlikely to exceed 5% of the harm from conventional smoking. That's quite a bold statement. And if it were to be true, then it means that vaping is 95% safer than regular smoking. However, the FDA hasn't approved any ecigarette as a smoking cessation device, and it hasn't authorized to make any claims about risk reduction compared to regular cigarettes. Vaping is associated with an increased risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchitis, and asthma, even among those who have never smoked regular cigarettes. Yes. Vaping is safer than regular smoking, but it doesn't come without any health risks. Whether or not vaping is gonna increase your mortality or give you cancer, we don't know because it's such a new thing, and we don't have any long term study.
