Your body can make glycine as well as collagen, but the amounts are quite small. To make glutathione and creatine and heme, that also takes maybe three grams. But for collagen turnover, daily collagen turnover is like 12 grams of glycine. You may need, like, you know, 15 grams of glycine. If your body only makes three and you're not really getting that much from diet, definitely need, like, 10 at least.
