My idea of the future is we don't even need a dentist. Nature has your body designed perfectly. Your immune against tooth decay. Your teeth are hard as stone. If you start early, you grow balance. You have space for your teeth, and you can bite and you can breathe through your nose, not through your mouth. This is how nature has it. Unfortunately, epigenetically, we do all the opposite. So what we should do in the future as doctors, dentists, health coaches, it doesn't even matter, train our patients the way that they learn even before they get pregnant, how to support the body during pregnancy, how to breastfeed, because this is the initial orthodontic treatment that nature has provided us to get a strong jaw, breathing through your nose. This is all breastfeeding, especially if you had prepared your body with the right nutrition, right supplements, right lifestyle, sleep hygiene, all these things apply, and then we don't even need to drill. And actually, lesson number one in dental school is do not use the drill because as soon as you drill that tooth, it's never going to be the same.
