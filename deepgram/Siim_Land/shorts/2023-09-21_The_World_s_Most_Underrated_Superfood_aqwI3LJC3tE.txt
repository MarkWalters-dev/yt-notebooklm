You can instantly eat something that will improve your mood, improve your brain function and even encourage weight loss. It's one of the world's most underrated superfoods and access to it is considered a human right. Yes, I'm talking about water and here's why you should drink more of it. Our cells need water to function properly so it's important to stay hydrated. Water helps us to digest food, it gives us energy and it also lubricates our joints. The US National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine recommends around 3.7 liters of water per day for men and 2.7 liters of water per day for women. But drinking regular water is not enough. You also want to get access to enough minerals and electrolytes. Electrolytes are the ones that actually make you hydrated and charge your cells. You can easily increase the hydration of your water by adding a little bit of salt to it.
