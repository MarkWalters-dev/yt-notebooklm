If you pay attention to these four things, you'll never buy fake extra virgin olive oil ever again. Anyone can recognize fake extra virgin olive oil by using just one of these tricks. What you need to do is pay attention to these things: the label, the smell, the color of the bottle and the sensation it leaves on your tongue. All these characteristics help you to determine if the oil is fake or real. For example, the reason the label is very useful is because fake olive oil is usually mixed fifty fifty with canola oil. Secondly, if it smells rancid and bad, then it's probably fake or it has become oxidized, which is even worse. A quality manufacturer will pay attention to these details, but the scammers don't. But the most surprising way to know if the olive oil is fake or real, if the oil tingles on on your tongue and the back of your throat, then it's real. Buying extra virgin olive oil and getting fake oil is like buying a Ferrari and getting an old car from a junkyard. It's important to make sure that you get your money's worth and that you don't damage your health.
