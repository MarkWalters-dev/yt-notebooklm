Why you should lift before doing cardio. If you lift weights after you do cardio then you might be missing out on some benefits. It's better to do cardio after lifting weights than before. Here's why. If you do cardio before weights then you might not have enough strength to actually reach your potential with strength training. But if you do strength training before cardio, then you will still have enough energy to do cardio. If you don't want to do cardio and strength on the same day, then just do them on the other days. For example, you can go one day strength, the second day cardio, etcetera. Making a schedule and planning out your workouts is the best thing for performance and is going to prevent plateaus.
