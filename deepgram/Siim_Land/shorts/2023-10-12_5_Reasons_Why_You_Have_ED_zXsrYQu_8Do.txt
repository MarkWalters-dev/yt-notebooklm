Stop using Viagra to fix your erectile problems. The solution is actually easier than you think. These five factors could be causing erectile dysfunction. Number one, being overweight. Losing weight will improve the quality of your erections. Body fat lowers your testosterone levels by converting it into estrogen. Number two, not getting enough sunlight. Sunlight increases your vitamin d levels which then increases testosterone. But the UV radiation from sunlight also increases nitric oxide that improves erectile quality. Exercise helps with weight loss and improving blood flow throughout the entire body. Following a sedentary lifestyle is associated with erectile dysfunction. Number four, eating too much sugar. Sugar can damage the arteries and blood vessels that reduces blood flow and can cause erectile dysfunction. Number five, eating too many fatty foods. You might want to cut down on the burgers and fries in your diet. Too much triglycerides in the bloodstream can reduce erectile quality and cause erectile dysfunction. Removing these factors from your life can improve your performance in the bedroom and help prevent erectile dysfunction.
