Atherosclerosis or the plaque buildup in your arteries is one of the main drivers of heart disease. Fortunately, there are some foods that have been shown to prevent that. Number one, natto. Natto is a fermented soybean dish. It's also the highest food source of vitamin k two in the world. High dietary k two intake is associated with reduced coronary calcification. Natto intake is linked to lower cardiovascular disease and all cause mortality. Number two, whole milk. This might sound surprising, but a twenty twenty one monthly ethnic study of atherosclerosis found an inverse association between self reported whole milk consumption and coronary artery calcification progression. Three, garlic. A 2018 randomized trial demonstrated that two hundred and fifty milligrams of aged garlic extract for twelve months was able to slow down atherosclerosis progression. Aged garlic supplementation has been seen to lower coronary artery calcification progression. These foods aren't going to move the needle in a clinical sense, but they're definitely healthy things to add to your diet to protect against calcification.
