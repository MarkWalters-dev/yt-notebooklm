The CDC in The US has reported an outbreak of lead and chromium poisoning in children. It is thought to be linked to the cinnamon apple sauces that contain lead. The outbreak has been reported in 44 states and involved over ninety adverse incidents. Some of the brands involved include Wanabana, Schnucks, and Waze. They've been seen to contain lead, and they've been issued to be recalled. This applies to only cinnamon apple sauces, and the contamination is thought to have originated from a third party supplier of cinnamon. Cinnamon can also have liver damaging effects. Coumarin is a compound in cassia cinnamon that is harmful to the liver. If you're buying cinnamon then it should be Ceylon cinnamon which doesn't have the liver damaging effects. Overall, the purpose of this video is to spread awareness about the potentially harmful compounds in the food supply and to educate people about making healthier and better decisions with their diet.
