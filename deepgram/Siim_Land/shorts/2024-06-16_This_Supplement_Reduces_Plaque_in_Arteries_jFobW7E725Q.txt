Natokynase is a supplement with potential benefits for the heart. It has antihypertensive, anti clotting, antiplatelet, and anti atherosclerotic properties. Natokynase is an enzyme derived from natto, the fermented soybean dish. Natto is the highest food source of vitamin k two in the world, and its consumption is linked to a lower risk of heart disease and mortality. A 2022 retrospective study found that nattokinase at a dose of ten thousand eight hundred f u's per day showed significant reductions in atherosclerosis progression by sixty six point five to ninety five point four percent. However, a dose of thirty six hundred was found to be ineffective. A 2017 clinical trial in China found that a dose of six thousand f u's per day was effective, but a 2021 clinical trial found that a dose of two thousand f u's per day wasn't effective. So there appears to be a dose dependent effect of nattokinase with anything below thirty six hundred FUs per day not being effective. Overall, I am interested about nattokinase all for more.
