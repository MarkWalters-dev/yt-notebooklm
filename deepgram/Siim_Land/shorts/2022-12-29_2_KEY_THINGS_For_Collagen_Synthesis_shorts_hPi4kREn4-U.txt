Vitamin C, copper is, like, mineral that makes the collagen tighter or stronger. The final step of making the actual collagen tangled and more cross linked together. Yep. The enzyme is called lysyl oxidase, a copper dependent enzyme. It also depends on vitamin c as well. Vitamin c helps to stimulate the messenger RNA in the cartilage cells that synthesize collagen. From that aspect, it actually vitamin c is what helps to synthesize collagen, but it also helps strengthen collagen because it improves lysyl oxidase as well as copper, which is needed to cross link type one collagen. And the reason why most collagens aren't necessarily cross linked, it's the type one, which is why it's so strong. For gram basis, type one collagen is stronger than steel because of copper and vitamin C's ability to cross link it and increase its strength.
