Last month, I went to the world's most advanced biohacking retreat in India. Here are some of the things that I did there. We measured over a 180 biomarkers such as enzymes, lipids, kidney function, heavy metals, inflammation, vitamins, minerals, and a lot more. I got a full body MRI and ultrasound to scan my body for potential malignancies. I took fitness tests like and resting metabolic rate test. I measured my body composition, muscle mass, and bone density with a DXA scan. I got a face skin analysis to analyze my skin moisturization and aging. I got a hydrophacial treatment for improving skin hydration. I got a posture analysis to identify muscle imbalances and tightness. And all of this in a five star hotel with amazing food and service. It's basically a full body complete health checkup plus consultation with some of the best doctors. The clinic I work together with is called iWo, and we're going to be having more of the same retreats in the future.
