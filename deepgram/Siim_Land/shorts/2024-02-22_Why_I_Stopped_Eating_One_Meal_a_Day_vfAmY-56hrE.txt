Been doing intermittent fasting for the last ten years. About three of those years, I was eating purely one meal a day. However, I stopped doing one meal a day, and I'm doing something much better now. Here's how my one meal a day looked like. I fasted in the morning, had a cup of coffee at noon, worked out, and then ate my dinner around 5PM. The reason I stopped was it because it was harder to build muscle and strength with. I'm already very lean and physically active. In order for me to take my strength and muscle to the next level, I had to add more meals. Introducing targeted intermittent fasting. This is my new method of eating one meal a day that I've been doing for the last three to four years. Basically, I still eat one meal a day in the evening. However, I have a protein shake with about 30 to 40 grams of protein before my workout. This has been a game changer for my own journey and helped me to build five kilograms of muscle and get a lot stronger. Eating just one meal a day is fine for weight loss and maintaining. However, to build more muscle and strength, you need an additional protein snack to support protein synthesis and reduce protein breakdown. The protein shake before my workout achieves just that.
