Can't seem to figure out what triggers your acne. Here's a list of three foods that has been shown to promote acne. Number one is milk and dairy products. Dairy contains different hormones such as IGF one and estrogen, which are implicated in acne. Dairy consumption has been seen to be associated with higher IGF one levels. These foods include milk, whey protein, yogurt, and cheese. However, it's found that the dairy consumption is linked with acne on a more westernized diet. Number two, high glycemic foods. Foods high in the glycemic index have been seen to exacerbate acne. These foods include refined grains like white bread and pastries, sugar and sugar sweetened beverages. The reason is insulin and IGF-one that promote the growth of sebum, which is this oily substance in the skin. Low glycemic dads, on the other hand, have been seen to improve acne, So opt for more vegetables and fiber instead of chips and fries. Number three, all the foods that you're allergic to. Food sensitivities like eggs, chicken, peanuts, soy, fish, dairy, or nuts and seeds can increase inflammation in your body, which then worsens acne. So be more careful with the foods that you're sensitive to.
