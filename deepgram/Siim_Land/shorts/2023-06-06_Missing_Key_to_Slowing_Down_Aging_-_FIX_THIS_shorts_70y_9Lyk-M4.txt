Here's a secret hack to slow down the aging process. During aging, your repair processes decrease and your body experiences more damage. One of the biggest repair hormones in the body is melatonin. That's why during your sleep, your body is repairing the most. Unfortunately, the older you get, the less melatonin you start to produce. This is going to decrease your sleep quality and accelerate aging. Fortunately, it has been found that you can reverse this process and still produce melatonin. The key metabolite for this is NAD. NAD is an enzyme involved with energy production and the longevity pathways. But unfortunately, again, with age, your energy levels drop by more than half. Here are the things you can do to raise your energy levels naturally. Number one is exercise and regular physical activity. Number two is any kind of energy stress like calorie restriction, time restricted eating, and eating a diet high in polyphenols and phytonutrients. Your body also recycles its energy levels naturally and this process depends on the circadian rhythms.
