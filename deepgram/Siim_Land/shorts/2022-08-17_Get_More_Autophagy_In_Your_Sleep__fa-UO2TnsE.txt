If you want to maximize the benefits of intermittent fasting and times you're eating then you also want to coordinate, do or conduct these processes together when it's the most optimal time to do so. And that for humans apparently is alone. You know, earlier the first part, first half of the night where you have increased in melatonin, increased growth hormone and increased autophagy. In practice what this means is that early time receded eating where you eat breakfast, lunch, maybe like a lighter dinner or an early dinner that, you know, in theory is probably better for getting the benefits of autophagy because you're going into a semi fasted state already once you go to bed and you don't have this higher amount of liver glycogen to buffer the process of going into autophagy and high amounts of, insulin and high blood sugar levels can also disrupt your sleep. So it all makes sense that, you know, you shouldn't eat immediately before bed and you will want to have at least a few hours before bed where you're not eating.
