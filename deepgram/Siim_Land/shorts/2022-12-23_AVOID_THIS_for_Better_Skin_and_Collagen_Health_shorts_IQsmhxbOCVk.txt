Oral birth control has been shown in two clinical studies in humans to dramatically suppress collagen synthesis because estrogen is important for that. After menopause, collagen synthesis really goes down because of the estrogen drop. Cortisol and stress will break down collagen more. Inflammation will break down collagen more. So having a low inflammatory state will help preserve and reduce the breakdown of your own collagen. Beyond just getting the supplements and the precursors, it's really important to also live an overall healthy lifestyle so that you're not excessively breaking down the collagen that you have.
