Next question: is turmeric okay post workout or does the inflammatory effect negatively affect muscle gains? Taking a cold shower or an ice bath after a workout, resistance training workout that is, that can be counterproductive for muscle growth. And the same applies to these anti inflammatories like turmeric, kai dose, vitamin c, nac after workout. So yeah, you don't want to take these anti inflammatories after the workout. You want to let the natural inflammatory process to, go through. You want to take the anti inflammatories in the morning or before the workout.
