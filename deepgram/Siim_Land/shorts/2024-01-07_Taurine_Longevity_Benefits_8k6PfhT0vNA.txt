Taurine is a non essential amino acid that's often used in energy drinks. However, a 2023 study also found that taurine extended the lifespan of mice by ten to twelve percent. Life expectancy of these mice also increased by eighteen to twenty five percent. The reason for these results was that taurine helped to regulate the hallmarks of aging. In humans, taurine deficiency is associated with poor health such as liver disease, obesity, hypertension, and inflammation. Unfortunately, with age, taurine levels decline. The problem with this study is that it's obviously a mouse study and we don't have human clinical trials showing whether or not it has longevity benefits. However, there are some clinical trials in humans showing how taurine supplementation increases antioxidant effects in older people. Taurine is also thought to be an important nutrient in the Japanese diet that has longevity benefits. So eating more foods that have taurine might be beneficial for anti aging and longevity. The human equivalent amount they used in this study was three to six grams of taurine. Unless you are eating a lot of seafood, then it's unlikely that you'll hit that amount with just diet.
