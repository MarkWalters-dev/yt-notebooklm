Too much protein is thought to accelerate aging. In animal studies, protein restriction has been seen to extend lifespan. But what does the data say about humans? A 2020 systematic review and dose response meta analysis found that higher protein intake was associated with a lower risk of all cause mortality. Specifically, plant based protein consumption was linked to even greater reduction in all cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. So a higher protein intake doesn't appear to increase the risk of death in humans. Low protein diets haven't actually seem to be associated with higher mortality in the elderly people. That's because protein helps them to preserve muscle. The elderly with less muscle have a significantly higher risk of all cause mortality because of frailty and metabolic disorders. So there's no evidence that a higher protein intake would shorten your lifespan. In fact, it can actually have the opposite effect, especially in the elderly people. Just know that you don't see additional muscle growth benefits by consuming more than 0.8 grams of protein per pound of body weight. Follow for more.
