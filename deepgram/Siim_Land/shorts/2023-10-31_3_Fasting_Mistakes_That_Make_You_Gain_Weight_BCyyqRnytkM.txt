Fasting mistakes that make you gain weight. Some people think that fasting is a miracle cure for weight loss, but that's not the case. Here are three common mistakes people make on their fasting journey that are completely avoidable. Mistake number one, giving yourself too many treats after breaking a fast. Some people think that it doesn't matter and they can't gain weight because they just fasted. But calories still matter and these little cheating moments will begin to add up over time. Mistake number two, not exercising. Exercise is much more powerful for weight loss than fasting and is much more important to your health. Mistake number three, snacking before going to bed. This can make you end up consuming too many calories and it can also disrupt your sleep quality. Fasting can be very useful and effective but staying healthy and avoiding these mistakes is much more important for your weight loss.
