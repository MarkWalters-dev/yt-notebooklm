What happens to your body if you exercise every day? Day one, you'll probably don't know specifically what to do. You don't know how to perform the exercises correctly. You don't know how long should you work out. And even if you do, it probably feels very uncomfortable and unmotivating. Day two to three, you will feel muscle soreness from the previous day's workout because you exercised muscles that you haven't used before. Day five, you start to feel better. You sleep better. You have more energy. Your mood is better and you've lost some weight. Day seven to 10, you've lost a noticeable amount of weight. The muscle soreness has went away, and you're starting to enjoy the workouts. Day ten to 14, you feel stronger. You start seeing more muscle definition and a flatter stomach. Day fourteen to 20, you start to look forward to your daily exercise, not only because of the weight loss results, but also because of how it makes you feel. Now you're hooked. You start exercising just for the sake of exercise itself. And by doing that, you'll be able to stay more consistent and get even better results. Overcoming the first hurdle is the most difficult part of starting to exercise. But if you stay consistent, you'll absolutely start loving it. Follow for more.
