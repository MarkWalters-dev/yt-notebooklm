Don't take ice baths. Let me explain. You've probably seen on social media these different athletes and people doing a lot of cold exposure in icy lakes or just ice baths. There is many benefits to that in terms of reducing cold body inflammation, helping with joint pain, stiffness, soreness. However, there are some negative side effects to it such as reduction in muscle anabolism and there are actually multiple studies showing that cold water immersion for multiple minutes after resistance training specifically reduces muscle anabolism and can have a negative effect on muscle hypertrophy. This generally applies to being in an ice bath or a very cold water for multiple minutes like five minutes or so. A regular cold shower probably doesn't have any significant impact, but if you are interested in building muscle then you definitely don't want to do the cold immersion for multiple minutes after resistance training.
