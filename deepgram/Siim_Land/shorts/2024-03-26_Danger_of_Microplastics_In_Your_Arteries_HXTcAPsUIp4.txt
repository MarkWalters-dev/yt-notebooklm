I've talked a lot about the dangers of microplastics in your food, plastic containers, and personal care products. Many people don't think that it's serious. However, there's a brand new study that implicates microplastics in heart disease. It was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. They took 304 people to the study and followed them up for thirty four months. People with detected microplastics and nanoplastics within the atheroma had a three hundred and fifty three percent higher risk of cardiovascular events than those without. That's pretty crazy if you think about it. The people who had more microplastics in their arteries had a four times higher risk of experiencing heart attacks, strokes, and even cardiovascular death. Now this study is obviously quite alarming and serious, especially given the fact that you can find microplastics virtually everywhere, from water, from foods, from clothes, personal care products, and even the air you breathe. We don't know if there's a causal relationship between microplastics and heart disease, but but it's certainly something to be careful with. As of now, you should try to minimize your exposure to microplastics and try to replace them with healthier alternatives. Follow for more.
