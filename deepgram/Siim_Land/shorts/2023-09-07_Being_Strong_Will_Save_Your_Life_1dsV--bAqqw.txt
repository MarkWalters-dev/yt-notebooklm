Do you want to improve your longevity? Starting to build muscle strength right now will help you live longer down the line. As we get older, many different kinds of issues will start to pop up like joint pain, weight gain, and muscle weakness. It's gonna happen to everyone to a certain extent, but building strength right now will slow down this process. There's a strong link between increased muscle strength and reduced risk of mortality and increased longevity. This includes a reduced risk of falling and breaking hips, having better metabolic health, lower inflammation levels, and just increased life expectancy. Measuring your grip strength is a quick and easy way to assess your overall muscle strength. Grip strength can predict future disabilities and lifespans by up to twenty five years later. High muscle strength also reduces the risk of overall mortality and cardiovascular disease by twenty to thirty five percent. So it doesn't matter how old you are, you should start training right now. And it's never too late to start, even if you're in your forties or fifties.
