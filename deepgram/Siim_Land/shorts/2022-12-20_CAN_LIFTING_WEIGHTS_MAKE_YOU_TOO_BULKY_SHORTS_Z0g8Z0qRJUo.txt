It's like a slow motion train wreck. You see the train coming and you're like, no, I'm getting too bulky. But it's coming it's gonna arrive in two years when you become too bulky. All the time to, like, not gain muscle and change your routine if you want to. So it's like a slow motion train wreck that you can see coming three years away. And even then, it's very unlikely that it's actually ever gonna happen.
