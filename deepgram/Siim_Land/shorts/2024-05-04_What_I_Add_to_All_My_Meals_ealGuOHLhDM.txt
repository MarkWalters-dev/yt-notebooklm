These are the ingredients I try to add to my every meal for better blood sugar and lipid regulation. Number one. Omega threes have been shown to have cardio and neuroprotective benefits. People with the highest blood levels of EPA and DHA haven't seen to have a lower risk of death from heart disease and Alzheimer's. Number two, apple cider vinegar mostly for the salad dressing and taste. But it can also help to lower the blood sugar and insulin response after eating. Number three, olive oil also has many proven cardio and neuroprotective effects. Higher olive oil consumption is linked to a forty eight percent reduced risk of cardiovascular disease mortality. It also tastes great and helps to lower blood sugar response and lipid response. Number four, psyllium husk lowers postprandial lipids and cholesterol. They can also add a bit of crunch. And lastly, number five, wheat germ is a big source of trimethylglycine and sperminin. Higher sperminein intake from foods is linked to up to a thirty percent lower risk of mortality. In practice, I mix all of these with my vegetables. Tastes great and it's amazing for your blood work. Try it out.
