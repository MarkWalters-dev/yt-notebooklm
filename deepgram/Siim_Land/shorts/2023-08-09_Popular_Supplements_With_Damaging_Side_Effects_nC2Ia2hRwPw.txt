Popular supplements with damaging side effects. What people don't understand is that these supplements that they love can actually increase the risk of death. Resveratrol has limited evidence that it's beneficial, but there is also evidence that it can cause harm. For example, it can reduce testosterone levels, reduce your VO2 max, and blunt some of the positive adaptations to exercise. The same effects apply to metformin which is a popular diabetic drug. Next up, we have iron which in excess can cause liver damage and heart disease. The same applies to calcium. Calcium supplementation has been found to promote calcification and increase the risk of heart disease. If your iron levels and calcium levels are low then supplementation has no risk. But if you take these supplements while already being in the normal range, it could have some negative side effects on your health. Lastly, we have cinnamon which does have a lot of health benefits, especially if it's ceilent cinnamon. But there is another type of cinnamon called cassia cinnamon that is very commonly used and it can have damaging effects on your liver.
