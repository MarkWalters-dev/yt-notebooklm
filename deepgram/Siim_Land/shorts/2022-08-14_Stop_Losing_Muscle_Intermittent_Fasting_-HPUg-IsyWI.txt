If you are fasting, then, yeah, you are spending more time in a catabolic state. But it doesn't have to mean that your net balance is going to be more catabolic than anabolic. The most important thing for that is making sure that you eat adequate amounts of protein. What I like to do, and I've seen great results with this, is to also reduce the catabolic burden that I experience in the fasted state. Number one is gonna be essential amino acids that contain the essential amino acids that your body needs to trigger protein synthesis and not lose muscle. The second one is HMB and, this is a byproduct of leucine that has been shown to be beneficial for combating sarcopenia and frailty in elderly people. And, you know, in some sense that also happens when you are fasting, in a fasted state.
