Spermidine is a supplement that's become very popular. It's said to have antiaging and longevity benefits. However, after looking at all the research, I'm not taking spermidine. Spermidine is a pooamine that regulates autophagy, inflammation, and other vital processes for longevity. Higher dietary spermidine intake is associated with up to thirty percent lower mortality. However, all of this is found with dietary spermidine, the spermidine you get from foods, not supplements. The evidence for supplemental spermidine is much more limited. A 2023 randomized placebo controlled trial on healthy adults found that high dose spermidine as a supplement for five days didn't increase blood or salivary spermidine levels. A 2022 randomized controlled trial found that long term spermidine supplementation in people with subjective cognitive decline didn't modify memory and biomarkers compared to placebo. So it's better to get your spermidine from Whole Foods. Number one, wheat germ. Number two, soybeans. Number three, natto. Number four, cheddar cheese. And number five, mushrooms. Follow for more.
