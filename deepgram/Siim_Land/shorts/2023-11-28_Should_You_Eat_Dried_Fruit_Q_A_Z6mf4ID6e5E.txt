I'm trying to include healthier snacks in my diet. Are dried fruit a good option? Dried fruits have many health benefits. Raisins and prunes are a great source of boron, which is a mineral that is important for your bones, vitamin D and testosterone. Drying the fruit removes the excess water but it maintains all the vitamins and minerals which makes the dried fruit a healthy snack. They're also rich in antioxidants that help to lower inflammation and oxidative stress. But moderation is key because dried fruit still has plenty of calories and many of them contain added sugars and oils. Plenty of calories and many of them contain added sugars and oils. Check for the ingredients that it doesn't have added sugar and oils and don't eat the entire bag, just eat a handful. Some dried fruit are worse than others, for example dried bananas are cooked in a lot of oils which makes them very high in calories. Instead the best ones are raisins, dried blueberries and prunes.
