Number one, information systems like DNA. What damage this, and what can people do to maintain it and improve it? In your regular cells, you have a limited number of times a cell can turn over, somewhere between forty and sixty. It it means, number one, you want to make the health of your cell as good as possible so that you're not constantly having to turn them over. And secondly, you wanna decrease stress because stress is known to decrease telomeres. And a lot of this goes back to lifestyle. If you smoke forty pack years of cigarettes, you lose 18% of your telomeres, which is about seven point four years. Telomeres are hard to sort of control, but it's certainly possible to at least decelerate air loss.
