I've been taking collagen peptides for over three years. I think everyone should be taking collagen for slowing down skin aging and supporting joint health. That's because collagen levels in the skin start declining already in your twenties by about 10% per decade. Here are the biggest things I noticed when starting to take collagen. My skin has become a lot more supple and I've lost some of the wrinkles on my forehead that I had before. I haven't changed my habits that much, but from a dietary standpoint, I added collagen peptides and I started taking ten grams of gysin per day which contributes to collagen turnover. I think collagen peptides alone work for reducing skin aging and it's backed up by many studies. A 2023 meta analysis of 26 randomized controlled trials showed that collagen peptides improved skin hydration by about 18.9 and skin elasticity by 21.6%. The doses used ranged from two point five to twelve grams per day of either bovine or marine collagen and the improvements became more noticeable after eight weeks of supplementation. However, what I've noticed is that you get a lot more benefits for the skin antiaging if you combine collagen with additional glycine. That's because glycine is the most important amino acid in collagen that's responsible for collagen synthesis and you need up to twelve grams of glycine per day for optimal collagen turnover. Your body needs glycine for more essential functions like glutathione and creatine synthesis, which is why skin collagen turnover becomes secondary if you're not getting enough glycine. Most diets unfortunately are fairly low in glycine. If you take ten grams of collagen peptides every day like I do, then you're getting three grams of glycine from that because collagen is 30% glycine. So yes, collagen peptides do work and they contribute to your daily glycine demand, but it's only three grams. But if you're only taking ten grams of collagen peptides then you're not getting enough glycine for the optimal effect. That's why I also take around ten grams of glycine spread throughout the day on top of the ten grams of collagen. So I have noticed a general improvement in the youthfulness of my skin, I have less resting wrinkles on my forehead and my skin is a lot more hydrated and supple. I was still exercising and eating a healthy diet and I was even doing red light therapy back then before taking collagen. And I'm still doing red light therapy, it's just the collagen has been one of the biggest changes. What about joint health? That's the second biggest reason people take collagen for their joint function. After all, your cartilage that protects your joints and bones is made of collagen which is often found to be damaged in osteoarthritis. In clinical trials, collagen supplementation has been seen to improve bone mineral density, tendon injury, arthritis, and osteoporosis. Now personally, I can't say if collagen did have an effect on my joint health or my bone density. I do have very high bone density as shown by my DEXA scans. It's 2.9 standard deviations above normal for my age group. But my first DEXA scan was taken in 2023 which is when I was already taking collagen for a few years. So I don't have a before and after for my bone density. I don't think that collagen is responsible for my high bone density because the biggest thing that will increase it is resistance training. Taking a supplement, eating a certain way, or being healthy without lifting weights isn't going to increase your bone density that much. You need to overload the joints with heavier weights. Interestingly, there is research that collagen supplementation at five grams a day combined with resistance training results in greater tendon growth than resistance training alone. That's because both the collagen and the mechanical tension from lifting weights both stimulate collagen synthesis and apparently the mechanical tension is more effective if you also take collagen with that. So you get a combined enhanced effect if you do both. In fact, taking ten grams of collagen peptides or fifteen grams of gelatin with forty eight milligrams of vitamin c before exercise enhances collagen synthesis more than exercise alone. A dose of five grams before exercise resulted in higher collagen synthesis than placebo, but fifteen grams was more effective. So for joint function, the optimal time to take collagen would be one hour before exercise. I can't confirm it if that's the case from my own example because like I said, I already had high bone density and I didn't know if it was because of collagen or not. But I don't have any hip pain, I don't have any tendon pain, I've never broken a bone or had a major injury. But that was the case already before I started to take collagen. So here are the biggest things I've noticed when taking collagen. It improved my skin health and reduced some wrinkles. Although, I was also taking large doses of glycine. For optimal results, you wanna take both glycine and collagen in my opinion. For joint health, I can't save the reason effect because it's hard to measure and I hadn't done a DEXA scan before starting to take collagen. There's also research about collagen improving cardiovascular disease risk factors like arterial stiffness and blood lipids. But I haven't noticed the difference from all the other supplements and things I do in that area. Here's the optimal collagen protocol for these benefits. I support a larger dose of ten to fifteen grams of collagen for the skin and joint benefits. However, you also want to add at least five to ten grams of glycine for optimal skin collagen turnover. For joint collagen synthesis, you need at least fifteen grams of collagen one hour before exercise. Take it with at least fifty milligrams of vitamin c for enhanced collagen synthesis from the exercise. Theoretically, the same could apply to derma rolling. So if you take collagen one hour before derma rolling you might see enhanced benefits for the skin. If you have kidney stones or you're more susceptible to them then very large amounts of collagen might not be suitable because hydroxyproline, which is one of the amino acids, can increase the risk of kidney stones. The optimal form of collagen is a mix of bovine and marine collagen peptides, which is synonymous with hydrolyzed collagen. If it says low molecular weight, then that's the best.
