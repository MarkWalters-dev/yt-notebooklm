Welcome back to the channel. My name is Sim Lund, and in this video, we're gonna talk about the oldest living person in history, John Calment. Jean Calment. And, yeah, we're gonna talk about why did she live so long, did she actually live that long, and, and, yeah, what are the things that we can take away. So make sure you click like and subscribe for future videos about optimizing your health and performance. Joan Louise Clement Okay. Is from France. She was born in 02/21/1875, and she died at the 08/04/1997. So she's a supercentenarian, and she is considered at least the most documented, the oldest person in history. And she lived until one hundred and twenty two years and one hundred and sixty four days, which is quite a long time. And, yeah, most, let's say, they they think that a human maximum, a human longevity is, like, 125 or something. And, yeah, she nearly maxed it out, almost maxed it out. There is, like, some controversy about whether or not, John Klement actually lived that long. So there was this Russian scientist a few years ago who came out with a paper that said that, that John Klement actually died in, like, 1934, and her daughter basically faked being her. And, if that would be the case, then that, that daughter is still pretty old. Like, she she would have died at 99 years old. But, currently, the most of the longevity people and most of the, let's say, scientists do think that, Jeanne Comment actually did live that long, that she was the one who, who who didn't die at nineteen thirty four when she died at nineteen ninety seven. So she lived actually longer than her daughter as well as her grandson, which is, you know, unfortunate and amazing at the same time. So what is the reason why did she live so long? Coleman's remarkable health presaged her later record. On television, she stated, I've never been ill never ever. All her life, she took care of her skin with olive oil and a puff of powder. At an unspecified time in her youth, she had suffered from migraines. Her husband introduced her to smoking offering cigarettes after meals, but she didn't smoke more. After the meal, after just one, I've had enough of it. Kolment continued smoking in her elderly years until she was 117, years old, which is, you know, pretty crazy to think about. And a lot of people would associate smoking with accelerated aging and shorter lifespans increasing the risk of cancers and heart disease and that sort of thing. So it is, yeah, quite mysterious that the oldest single person in history smoked until the age of 117. Name something that gets passed around. A joint. A joint. For example, like smoking, cigarette smoke causes oxidative stress to the body, and that can, like, turn on some of these, let's say, defense systems in the body as well. Like, the antioxidant defenses as well as, like, the autophagy gets increased when you get exposed to some of, like, smoke and cigarette smoke. She also probably had, like, a lower genetic risk for a heart disease and cancer, which would have allowed her to get away with smoking and not get cancer and not get heart disease. At retirement age, she broke her ankle, but before that had never suffered any major injuries. She continued cycling until her hundredth birthday. Around age 100, she fractured her leg but recovered quickly and was able to walk again, which is, you know, quite crazy. Like, most, older people, get osteoporosis and frailty. Frailty. And usually, if you have, like, lack of muscle mass and lack of bone density or muscle strength as well, then, getting a hip fracture is almost like a death sentence because, you become immobile and you're not able to recover from that. You, become sedentary. You're not moving around. You get diabetes. You get, neurodegeneration because of that. So, yeah, the the bone frailty is actually pretty dangerous to, older people, you know, for everyone, but, especially older people because they're not able to recover from that that easily. Double dose in the hip. Seated on her armchair, she did gymnastics wearing her stereo headset. Her exercises included flexing and extending the hands, then the legs. Nurses noted that, she moved faster than other residents who were thirty years younger. Her breakfast consisted of coffee with milk and rusks. So, yeah, physical exercise is obviously important and, you know, she's, 110 years old. She can lift weights probably. Although maybe she could do, like, some resistance bands or something. But any kind of gymnastics generally, does have, like, some stimulation on the muscles and and, it kinda keeps the muscles activated to a certain extent. She doesn't need, like, a lot of resistance because I would imagine, like, her strength isn't that high and any kind of movement itself would get the blood flowing, would activate the muscle fibers, etcetera, etcetera. So just the movement itself is pretty important. She could have also used things like, you know, let's say if in 2021, if she were to be in, like, in a biohacking nursing home, then she could have used, like, these electrical muscle stimulation devices as well, which do work, you know, at least in activating the muscles. They're not gonna make you check then, make you build muscle a ton, but they do help you to maintain muscle, especially if you're, you know, 110 years old. She could have used those, EMS, devices or, like, the blood flow restriction bands. So what about her breakfast? Coffee, milk, and rusks. So rusks are these kinds of, dry biscuits or bread type of cubes. Okay. For lunch, she, enjoyed braised beef or, do bay, which is quite basically like some kind of a crock pot, type of a stew, beef stew, but was not keen on boiled fish. So, yeah, like, you know, obviously very important to have, like, adequate intake of protein, especially if you're, old because protein helps to maintain muscle mass, and it's also, like, a very, high source of all these nutrients. She had dessert with every meal and said that given a choice, she would eat fried and spicy foods instead of the bland foods on the menu. So she made herself a daily fruit salad with bananas and oranges. She enjoyed chocolate sometimes indulging in a kilogram per week. So that's a yeah. She, didn't have, like, you know, clean diet. She She didn't eat a vegan diet. She didn't eat a keto diet. She didn't eat any kind of, any kind of a special diet. She eats, yeah, like whole foods, with except maybe like chocolate and, the bread. But, yeah, basically, it goes goes to show again that the food in or the food component itself has a very little impact on the particular longevity. Most of it has to do with calorie restriction, because your body can deal with, almost any kind of foods as long as you stay in a calorie calorie deficit state. If you are eating less calories, then it doesn't matter if it is, like, some kind of bad food or not the healthiest food because the calorie restriction kinda nullifies it out or at least mitigates some of the effects. Diabetes. After the meal, she smoked a Dunhill cigarette and drank a small amount of port wine. So she, smoked as well as drink some wine and ate some chocolate. And, yeah, she was living like a very hedonistic diet almost. In the afternoon, she would take a nap for two hours in her armchair and then visit her neighbors in the care home telling them about the latest news she had heard on the radio. At nightfall, she would dine quickly, return to her room, listen to music, smoke a last cigarette, and go to bed at 10PM. A joy. Her height was one hundred and fifty centimeters, four feet eleven inches, and her weight forty five kilograms and ninety nine pounds, showing little variation from previous years. So, that is, I think, a more important point because, she wasn't a big person. She was quite short and didn't weigh a ton. And I think that is something that you see in nature as well that the, some of the longest living organisms in the world, they're not elephants. They're not, like, massive animals. They're not huge. And you even like dogs, like larger dogs die a lot sooner than smaller dogs. And maybe that has to do with, again, like, a larger body. Your heart experiences more stress, has to pump more blood. You have to consume more calories to maintain that mass or larger body weight. Whereas if you're shorter and, with this body weight, you, basically have to, yeah, you cause less burden on the digestive system, etcetera, etcetera, because you're not eating that many calories as a whole. The reason why my shirt is too small is because I'm too big. So there you have it. As you can see, there are many things that, could contribute to, John Comen's longevity. I think that a lot of it has to do with genetics because, you know, she apparently had some lower IGF one levels, maybe lower growth hormone levels, lower risk of cancer and heart disease, etcetera, etcetera. So, yeah, she, just just because of that, she could have just lived a few decades longer than the average person. But let me know in the comments. Do you think that, Joel Clement was actually the one who lived until 122 years old, or was it her daughter that faked her and pretended to be her?
