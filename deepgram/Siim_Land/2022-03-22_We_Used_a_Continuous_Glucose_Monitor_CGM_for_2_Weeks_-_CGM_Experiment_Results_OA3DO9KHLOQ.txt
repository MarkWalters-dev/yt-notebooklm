Hey. My name is Sim Lund. And I'm Inka. And, in today's video, we're gonna talk about the two week experiment that we did with the continuous glucose monitor. So, basically, we used the CGM for two weeks, and we tracked the different foods that affect our blood sugar levels in real time for twenty four seven. And, yeah, in this video, we'll just, you know, go through our experiments and the graphs and all the insights that we gained from this. Make sure you click the like and subscribe as well for future videos about optimizing your health and performance. Flex. So I can see where your traces are. I don't know how to flex. We can see where your traces are. Oh, there's no traces. Oh, I was expecting more pain. They didn't even I couldn't even feel it. Scan. Five point three millimoles, which is, like, a hundred milligrams per deciliters on the lips. A again one hour post Do it. One hour post lunch. Didn't work. Seven point two. Okay. So, this is one of the, let's say, most average morning cup of coffee that we had, and, it's basically just regular coffee with almond milk or coconut milk. And as you can see, like, the spike there's no, like, any significant rise in it. This just seemed like a natural response to the caffeine and maybe some of the calories that you get from there, but no, like, real spike in it. And so here, I I used the milk and stevia, but nothing else. So it was just quite plain mix. Mhmm. But we did try oat milk as well to see what happens. And, yeah, as you can see, there is a quite as huge, like, spike in the blood sugar level with the oat milk, regular oat milk with, coffee. No added, like, any real just a very small calorie amount. There's no, like, sugar in it, although there is, like, this maltose sugar in oat milk that apparently spikes the blood sugar very high. And, I did see, like, a very similar rise, although not that high peak. But, yeah, it's quite surprising that, to see this. Yeah. I mean, it was the same for me and for you. And then I actually posted this on my Instagram, and I got several responses that that has happened as well to some other people, with oat milk specifically. So yeah. But if you add, like, all these, I think, that lower the blood sugar like glycine and napopectin and cinnamon and MCT powder, then, this the rise is much smaller, and it's not that, spiking. Yeah. So, basically, here, my idea was to add a little bit of fiber, a little bit of fat, and then, yeah, cinnamon and glycine to balance the blood blood sugar response, and it worked. And you can also see that the exercise, cardio, and weights, both of them, lower the blood sugar for you. And here with the lunch, I basically wanted to see the what happens if I eat still something after the lunch. So I took the lunch, and it started going lower already. But then I took coffee and and an additional protein bar, and you can see it started, like, going up again. Yeah. It started going up again. So I don't know if that would have happened without the protein bar or not. But Some Diet Coke to see if aspartame is gonna spike my blood sugar, and let's get a pretest first. 4.8. Follow-up. Three point zero. Three point zero. What? You were lower. Well, I've been, like, I've been just laying here, and I've been fast fasting as well. So, Yeah. I think that's part of the reason. But, I don't I mean, obviously well, it does show you that, you know, like, there's a diet co freezing spike of sugar. I think the reason it went lower is because of the fasting. I haven't, like, eaten anything. So now I'm going to compare the different types of chocolate or different intensities of chocolate. 50%, 85%, and then Kinder, which is something like maybe 10%. No. It's a minus minus 10%. Minus six. Yes. So my pre chocolate blood sugar is 5.6. 5.6. Okay. So it's been one hour since I ate two pieces of this 50% chocolate. And let's see what happened to my blood glucose. 6.1. It did rise. How much was it? How much was it? It was 5.6. Ah, okay. So, basically, it did rise. And it's still rising, actually. You can see from the graph. So But it's not spiking. It's not spiking. Saunas and wine. Mhmm. So, actually, we have the two identical days almost. First, you had the glass of wine during daytime at, 3PM. Yeah. Because I wanted to see it in a fast that's so reduced all the other variables. Mhmm. So what actually happens with the wine, to the blood sugar, it did go lower. One glass of wine was fine, but see the second picture, the the middle picture, actually, I had two glasses of wine and I went hypo. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. Like so alcohol doesn't really, like, spike the blood sugar, especially if you have to have it, like, with the empty stomach. It lowers it and, well, it's not hypo. Like, you're still, like, hypo would be, like, 2.5 or something. Mhmm. Like, all these are we're still we never actually went above these green lines. We were always in the green zone with the exception of the oat milk a little bit in the short term. But, yeah, we never neither neither of us actually went, like, crazy high with the blood sugar. And, like, you know, anything below 10 is even still after a meal pretty normal, or considered quite normal. Like, optimally, we don't really have, like, maybe seven or eight after a meal, but, yeah, like, even acutely going about 10 for a single meal for a healthy person isn't that significant, as long as you're still, you know, able to lower it back down. It doesn't stay elevated for too long. But the infrared sauna is actually it's also something that we both saw a little bit that the I actually saw quite a high, like, seven after just having the infrared sauna with no, food intake. Like, before eating, my blood sugar was, like, seven after the infrared sauna, which both of us had, like, a small rise in there. Breakfast cereal time. Yes. I'm gonna have a bottle of, strawberry crunch, mostly, which is, yeah, like, very difficult commercial mislea with Carbs. Yeah. Carbs and added sugars as well. I'm, like, low key scared because I haven't had breakfast for years, and I haven't or, like, at least this kind of breakfast. I'm gonna add some berries to make it very healthy. Berry healthy. Yes. And almond milk. Let me measure the blood sugar first. Yeah. Almost forgot that one. So let's see what kind of response do I get for this one. Okay. So 5.41. Thank you. Done. Nice. Yes. Okay. This is one hour post muesli. And one thing that I'm surprised is that I was feel, I was expecting to feel like a sugar rush or something like that, because it's it was sugary misty, but I don't actually feel very energized. But let's see what my blood sugar says. 7.6 volts per meter and changing the smoke. 7.6. And it, I guess, still still rising. No. It's peaked. It's plateaued. This is actually one of the highest that I've gotten so far. K. This is the granola experiment. So we had granola at lunch or not lunch even, like, in the morning, like, 10AM. So it was a regular granola with some berries, and it spiked quite high. Yeah. It did spike. So I think I think anything with, sugar, because it it was this kind of commercial granola, so it had some added sugars as well. Anything with sugar in fasted state does spike it quite quite high. And then there is but I think even more significant is this post food crash that comes. It's so rapid how it lowers the blood sugar. But I was interested to find out or to notice here when I ate the granola that I actually didn't feel more energized or, like, I didn't feel good after the granola. I actually felt a bit fatigued, but my blood sugar was very high. So that was a surprise. I would have expected when the blood sugar goes up, also my energy levels go up. And there's the training effect Yeah. Lowers. Again, lowers blood sugar and then a cranberry juice. Regular cranberry, like, store bought cranberry juice. Yeah. That also, like but that was the before the dinner. Right? Yeah. And, that spiked the blood sugar also high. Mhmm. Then you had the cranberry juice before lunch, and it also spiked. Mhmm. But then I took it I tested after dinner Ah. At the same day. So it actually didn't spike it. Nice. So I had high protein, high fat dinner as usual and then the cranberry juice. So, like, protein intense, before the carbs lower the much of the response to that carbohydrate. Yeah. And I noticed this with in several cases that it did help to stabilize the post meal, like, fluctuation. Yeah. And this is my dinner. So before dinner, I was pretty, like, low, and I ate a bunch of carbs. So it spiked it, higher. It still didn't reach above nine. This is me doing cardio. That's what I did, like, forty minutes of, quite intense cardio, like zone two and zone three between there. And, yeah, that plummeted my blood sugar quite quite low. The lowest, it was 3.2. And, when I did come back, I I did it, like, semi fasted. I had only drinking, like, a one protein shake before the cardio. And, when I came back, then I, like, laid on the bed, and then I felt a bit, like, low blood sugar, but, nothing, like, super crazy. So that was the only time where I did notice that. But I think it's just because of the, you know, exercise itself as well, which, plummeted the blood sugar. Why do you think it drops so low at the end or so fast? Well, I think, like, initially, when you start to exercise, then your blood sugar stores or glycogen stores are still a bit full. And, during the second half of the exercise, you basically burn through that. And, it kinda drops that in that sense. Mhmm. So then you go, like, really fast. You plummet. But I didn't, like, eat anything until, maybe two hours after that either, and nothing was wrong. This is a very average day for you and me. So, your blood sugar is pretty stable all the time. I I did notice, like, even different things like walking a little bit or, let's say, doing some a cold shower. I usually took a cold shower in the morning. That does spike the blood sugar as well a little bit. And, even, like, some walking in the acute acute short term, like, if you do, like, a few jumping jacks or Mhmm. Let's say run after some chickens or something like that, then, that, raises the budget a little bit. And you you you can see, like, these different small blimps and, things are doing the daytime all the time. And that can be all, like, from the environment. It doesn't have to it it may have to do nothing with food. Yeah. And I think this is super important, to know that there are so many things that other than food Mhmm. That affects the blood blood glucose levels. And this is actually one of the, I think, the biggest and greatest insights that you get when you're wearing this continuous tracker. You see that, oh, actually, I have way bigger response to, I don't know, sauna than food or last chance to do flight trigger measurement before the sensor ends. Let's see if it takes you through the jacket. Will it work? Yes. Yeah? Five by nine. It's rising, actually. On the walk. On the walking. K. Do it. Let's go. Okay. In one hour, sixty minutes. Gone in sixty seconds. 4.5. Wow. I'm actually pretty low one day. And that's it. We used the CGM for, fourteen days, and, we did you know, it was fun. It was pretty interesting. You can definitely become, like, a bit OCD about it sometimes. But, fortunately, like, neither one of us actually did take it too seriously or, yeah. We weren't, like, afraid of the blood sugar rises, and it's perfectly natural to see some rises. And I kinda wanted to see, like, some crazy graphs. There's some did those creme I, like, I never eat cremeula in the morning, but I just did it for the experiment. I wanted to see, like, a huge spike. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's definitely, like, a fun thing to do. And I think doing it, like, you know, once Mhmm. At least it's gonna be good to identify, like, how does your lifestyle actually affect your blood sugar and, you know, may whether maybe you're prediabetic or maybe you have actually full diabetes. So, yeah, it's good to kind of know. One thing that I want to emphasize is that these responses are highly individual. So, like, there has been plenty of studies that show that the blood sugar with the same food, with the same, basically, lifestyle, but just two different people, their blood blood sugar in response to different activities or food can be very different. So that's why I think it's important to measure it from yourself and rather than just, like, trust on general principles as well. Where can people find you online? Well, you can go to my Instagram at Ingrid. I actually shared some of these graphs as well there, some of the blood glucose graphs. So Alright. Thanks for, watching.
