One of the biggest reasons why people do fasting is to activate autophagy, burn a bunch of fat, and boost stem cells and all those good stuff. Unfortunately, they do say that in order to reach those benefits, you have to be fasting for several days and starve. What if I told you that there's a way to speed up the fasting process and gain those benefits much faster? Well, in this video, I'm gonna tell you how to do that and speed up fasting. But when I say speed up fasting, then I mean achieving those same metabolic effects that you get from the fastest states and activating those faster instead of actually somehow traversing through time and speeding up the entire process and going through it much faster. The idea is to do certain things that mimic the fasting physiology, and thus, you don't have to fast that long. Yes. The fastest state is distinct from a failed one with many unique characteristics. It happens when you haven't consumed any calories for about four to six hours and you've digested the food you last ate. Here are some of the hallmark features of a fasted state. Blood glucose and insulin levels drop because there are no carbohydrates in the bloodstream. Fatty acid oxidation increases as the body starts mobilizing its own stored adipose tissue for energy. Ketone bodies begin to rise during the process of converting fatty acids into ketones by the liver. This will begin to substitute for the lack of glucose in the brain and other vital organs. Anabolic pathways like mTOR and IGF one are suppressed. The body doesn't have enough nutrients to trigger cell growth and thus maintains energy efficiency. Catabolic pathways like AMPK and autophagy are activated. AMPK gets activated under energy stress to promote fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and autophagy. Metabolic factors like PGC one alpha, sirtuins, phosphoproteins, and AMPK increase to promote mitochondrial fusion and biogenesis. Fasting makes the mitochondria more energy efficient and abundant. Antioxidant defense systems get activated like n r f two and glutathione. They promote detoxification and removal of free radicals. Fasting increases NAD plus, which is a coenzyme that helps with all molecular reactions like energy production, mitochondrial function, DNA repair, and lifespan. Generally, it takes at least twenty to twenty four hours of fasting to see a significant increase in the most powerful metabolic factors, such as autophagy, sirtuins, glutathione, etcetera. Shorter fasts, like fourteen to twenty hours, are more for just managing insulin and confining when you eat, which is more like a lifestyle thing for convenience. Now there are plenty of things and activities that activate those same pathways, and they mimic the same physiology as you would while fasting. Here are a few examples. Exercise. Physical activity lowers insulin and increases fat oxidation. It also promotes AMPK due to depleting liver glycogen, which leads to autophagy. Moderate intensity endurance exercise promotes PGC one alpha, which builds mitochondria and ketosis. Resistance training has been shown to activate autophagy and reduce a keratosis of muscle cells. The training itself doesn't activate mTOR or insulin, although it makes the mTOR complex translocate closer to the cell membrane, so it could be turned on after you break the fast and start eating. Even prolonged exercise for two hours at moderate intensity has been shown to stimulate the capacity of muscles to extract ketones from the blood. Heat exposure. Heat shock proteins promote autophagy and have neuroprotective effects. Saunas also improve cardiovascular health and reduce all cause mortality by thirteen to fifteen percent. Cold exposure, lower temperatures activate FOXO proteins that promote longevity. Dietary polyphenols, herbal teas, coffee, dark, vegan vegetables, dark chocolate, olive oil, chokeberries, blueberries, and others stimulate autophagy, protect against neurodegeneration, and support the body's antioxidant system. Medicinal mushrooms like chaga, cordyceps, and others activate the Nrf two pathway and can lower adrenal stress on the body. They also promote autophagy. The metabolic state of ketosis, whether through fasting or nutrition, increases PGC one alpha, AMPK, and SIRT one, which causes mitochondria biogenesis. Ketone bodies are modulated by PGC one alpha, and they have anti inflammatory effects on the body. The ketogenic diet mimics a lot of the aspects of fasting. These things that I just mentioned, they mimic fasting much more in a superficial way. They're not going to put you into a faster state and make you feel like you fasted for three days. Instead, they just shift your metabolic gears more towards a fasted physiology and, you know, put you into this experience where you are almost fasting. Wait a minute. But you still need to fast. The only unique characteristic of fasting that you can only get from fasting is the actual fasted state, and that can be characterized by this suspension in your metabolism, and you're not digesting food. Your body is at risk and is basically completely not stimulated by anything. That's a fasted state. That's a pure fasted state. That's why I believe everyone should practice some form of time restricted eating regardless of their diet or goals. Studies in mice show that fasting sixteen hours and eating within eight hours prevents them from getting obese and develop hypertension despite being fed a junk food diet. Human studies also show that eating within six hours improves blood glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, circadian gene activation, and cardiometabolic risk factors compared to the standard three meals a day. Fasting for at least sixteen hours every day and eating within eight hours or preferably less is optimal for digestion, circadian rhythms, and the body's chronobiology. A daily sixteen hour fast is definitely not enough to activate autophagy or these other longevity pathways if you're just fasting and you're not doing anything else for sixteen hours. In order to get, like, a significant amount of autophagy from that amount, they need to apply these hacks that I just mentioned and, quote, unquote, speed up the process so that you get into autophagy faster. Strategery. Now, of course, you still have to do these longer fasts every once in a while. It's just that I think that you shouldn't be trying to put more and more stress on your body and think that more fasting is always the best option. More autophagy and more fasting aren't necessarily always the better choice. And in those cases, you actually want to, quote, unquote, speed up the process and fast less while still being able to reap the benefits of the fastest state.
