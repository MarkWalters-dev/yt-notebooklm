Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, also called HBOT, is a popular regenerative treatment that's said to be good for longevity by increasing the length of your telomeres and increasing stem cell proliferation. I used HBOT for two months for about two to three times a week, and there are some pretty interesting results I wanna share with you. So in this video, I'm gonna share with you my results, some of the interesting things I saw in my blood work, and I'll also explain the science behind h bot. So how does h bot work? Hyperbaric oxygen therapy or HBOT is a medical treatment where you breathe pure oxygen inside a highly pressurized chamber. When we're in the regular world, we're in normoxia or normal oxygen levels with no effects on our antioxidant defense. When our bodies experience mild hyperoxia during hyperbaric oxygen therapy, your body experiences mild hermetic stress that reinforces antioxidant defense. However, if the oxygen levels are chronically high or if the stress is too high, then it can cause more harm than good. Excess oxygen isn't good, which is why the air you breathe outside isn't pure oxygen. The same applies to hypoxia or low oxygen levels, which you can experience during exercise. Chronic hypoxia suffocates your cells from oxygen, but mild hypoxia done occasionally when you exercise enhances antioxidant events and can extend lifespan. That's why hyperbaric oxygen therapy can have health enhancing effects if you do it at the right dose. The mechanism of action for hBot is the stimulation of stem cell proliferation, increase in angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels, suppression of cells and essence, and elevation of antioxidant activity. This can have anti inflammatory effects and tissue oxygenating effects. So what was my experience? I used HPOT at a local clinic in Tallinn called Body Therapy. They had a nice small clinic with two HPOT chambers. Each session lasted for sixty minutes and I used a barometric pressure of 1.5, which is low to moderate. In total, I did about 20 sessions over the course of two months. Subjectively speaking, h bot feels great. Whenever the session finished, I was always kind of with very good energy levels. It felt great. Like, it felt like you came out of a nap and it felt like you just slept like eight to nine hours. I didn't notice anything inside the chamber and the effect went away within a few hours. But immediately after getting out of the chamber, you know, for the next two to three hours I did feel kinda especially clear or energetic. Let's talk about my blood work. Because there was one specific reason why I was interested in doing this heat pot in the first place. And the reason for that was homocysteine. High homocysteine levels can be a risk factor for heart disease and Alzheimer's. My wife, Inka, also had used h spot and she had used it for a lot longer, up to three to four months, for recovering from mold illness. She saw in her blood work that her homocysteine levels dropped significantly, which is why I thought hbot might work for my homocysteine as well. I'll let her share her experience in more detail. Hi. I'm Inka and, yes, I use hbot as well. I got interested in after I had mold illness and I had this residue low level inflammation in my body. And so I used it about 15 times, and what I saw was quite a significant improvement in my homosustine levels. When When I started the treatments, my homocysteine was 10.9. And after the 15 times, I took another measure and it it had dropped to 5.9, which is an excellent result. So the healthy levels of homocysteine varies between five to 15. So that's very much on the lower end. And what was quite surprising for me was the benefits that I also got for my skin and my gut health. For example, this inflammation that I had had on my skin in one cheek almost completely disappeared. And also my gut health improved quite a lot. I felt like it really supported the immunity on gut in general. My homocysteine has been slightly elevated all my life whenever I've tested it. I had previously already decreased my homocysteine from 12, which is not crazy high but higher than optimal, to nine, which is in the normal range but not optimal. Optimal will be closer to five. I had already tried taking all the methyl donors like TMG, b vitamins, etcetera, but it didn't go lower than nine. Then two months after using cage pot, about fourteen, fifteen sessions in, I tested my homocysteine and it had dropped to 6.4, which is amazing. That's close to five which is optimal. I didn't change anything else about my supplements or diet during this time and hvod was the only thing I did. There are no clinical trials specifically showing that hvod reduces homocysteine, but in the example of myself and my wife Inka, both of our homocysteine levels decreased. Now the reason why our homocysteine levels were high is not clear, but one thing could be mold exposure. I was born in an old moldy house that's like 50 to 60 years old and I lived there for over two decades. I never experienced any signs or symptoms of mold illness and nothing in my health indicated that I was even exposed to mold. But my wife is very sensitive to mold and she got symptoms immediately when she moved in. That's also the reason we had to move out. Her health was getting worse because of the mold. So maybe although my body wasn't showing any symptoms, I had no health problems, I have zero allergies, I have zero, like, other signs of inflammation in my body. Maybe the mold was secretly increasing my homocysteine levels. And because I was living there for such a long time, my homocysteine was baseline elevated because of that reason. And HBOT just brought it down. That's just one theory that I have. Inka also made a video on her channel about her experience with hbot so you can check it out in the link in the description. One thing that gets people excited about hbot is increasing telomere length. Telomeres are these caps on chromosomes that protect your DNA. A 2020 study found that hbot for 60 daily exposures among 35 healthy adults increased telomere length by twenty percent and decreased senescent t cell helpers by thirty seven percent. I didn't measure my telomeres before and after getting hbot because my telomeres are already as long as they can be. Longer than ninety nine percent of people. My telomeres did shorten significantly when I got COVID, but that was one point five years ago and they had already recovered. But I will be doing a telomere test in a month from now to see if there are any additional changes. So what can you use hbot for? The medical conditions that are approved to be treated with hbot include carbon monoxide poisoning, central retinal artery occlusion, decompression sickness, skin grafts, thermal burns, diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy, crush injuries or compartment syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis or flesh eating disease and radiation injury. There are claims out there that h pod is going to cure cancer, autism, stroke, AIDS, diabetes and Alzheimer's but there's no evidence for that currently. So, overall, my experience with hbot was quite positive. But, there are a few side effects that I did experience and you wanna be also aware of. The biggest and most concerning side effect was my eyesight and vision was getting worse. About one month into doing h bot, I noticed in the evenings especially that my eyesight was a bit blurry, the computer screen was a bit, foggy as well. So I was thinking like, am I getting diabetes or something? I don't know. My blood sugar is generally, like, perfect. I have no, spikes in my blood sugar. My hemoglobin a one c and everything is very normal. So what was the reason why I was getting this blurry vision? Then I found papers showing that HBOT can indeed cause vision problems and even lead to myopia or cataracts. There's evidence that excessive HBOT use can accelerate the development of cataracts when used beyond 20 to 50 sessions. I used about 15 to 16 sessions, but I still had some problems with my vision. Fortunately, these changes with vision and blurry vision, they go away after you stop doing HBOT. So they're kind of a temporary phenomenon. The way you deliver the oxygen also matters. In this 2019 randomness control trial, they saw that the myopic shift associated with h bot is reduced when using a mask instead of a hood. The myopic shift also lasted significantly greater in people getting h bot with a hood versus the mask. The recovery to normal eyesight also took longer with the hood. During my h bot sessions, I was always using the mask, not the hood. So my eyesight was also able to recover faster. The frequency of how often I did a h bot also mattered. If I did h bot three times a week, so every other day, then I did notice much more blurry vision than if I did it only once a week. After I took a slightly longer break, so one to two weeks of break from HBOT, then the vision went back to normal. So yes, excessive HBOT can have damaging effects on your eyes, so so you shouldn't really do it every day. What about hearing? There is some research that HBOT might improve hearing in patients with acute idiopathic sudden sensory neural hearing loss. But there's no evidence for chronic hearing loss or tinnitus as shown by twenty twelve meta analysis of seven studies. One thing worth mentioning is that when you are going into HVOT in the first few minutes when the chamber is being pressurized, then you might hear or feel some tingling in your ears or some whistling in your ears. The pressure is building up and that can have some discomfort in your ears. I think that's one of the most uncomfortable aspects of doing HBOT but usually they last only for the first few minutes and afterwards it goes away. With HBOT, there's one contraindication that's dangerous and you need to be aware of. And that's untreated pneumothorax, which is a condition where your lung collapses. The compression and decompression during hBot can lead to tension pneumothorax. So you should get a medical examination first to be safe. Certain medications can also be a contraindication such as blomycin, which is a cancer medication, and desulfiram, which is a medication for alcoholism. If you're taking any medications, then consult with your doctor first to know if h bot is safe for you. Alright. Let's bring this video to a conclusion. My experience with hbot was quite positive. I felt quite fresh after each session and my homocysteine levels did improve. My eyesight did get worse and blurry whenever I did more than one session per week which was quite scary and concerning. But the eyesight problems went away after I took a longer break. My plans for the future is that I'm not gonna be doing a regular HBOT. I'm probably not gonna get a HBOT to my house because I'm not gonna use it that often. But I'll probably take a HBOT session a few times a year whenever there's the opportunity. Especially maybe after I've traveled somewhere or if I have some sort of a sickness or a flu, which doesn't happen that often but, at least I'll have kind of a trick up my sleeve. Let's also talk about the costs because the price of hbot is very different in different countries. The price here in Tallinn was very cheap, only €30 for one session, and you could get it for only €525 for 20 sessions. Whereas, hbot can cost anywhere between 150 to $250 per session in The US or Canada. So if you're ever in Estonia or if you wanna fly into Tallinn to do HBOT for a few sessions or a few weeks, then check out the link in the description for the clinic where I did it. Alright.
