Three years ago, I measured my biological age with the DNA methylation clock. The results show that my epigenetic DNA methylation age was 16 compared to my actual chronological age, which was 25 at the time, Which means based on this test, I was younger than ninety nine percent of people at that age. Now three years have passed and it's twenty twenty three. I did a test again. In this video, I'm gonna take a look at my results after three years. Do it. So the test I used was myDNAge, which uses the DNA methylation age clock that, is based on the Horvath's clock. The Horvath's clock is considered currently, like, the gold standard of epigenetic age and DNA methylation age and the DNA methylation age of blood can predict all cause mortality in later life. Studies on over 41,000 participants have found that each five year increase in DNA methylation age was associated with an eight to fifteen percent increased risk of mortality. I took the second test in April 2023 so it's been three years since the first test and my results now still show that based on the methylation value of my sample, my DNH is 16 which is the same as in the first test but the difference is that my chronological age has increased by three years. So basically over the course of the last three years, my DNA methylation age which is slightly I wouldn't consider it actual biological age. So my DNA methylation age has stayed the same. So it's still 16. Winning. And I'm still in the ninety ninth percentile of my age which means I'm younger than 99% of people at my age of 28. So from this graph, you can see the kind of progression or the differences. First test 01/24/2020 around 16 and the second test 04/12/2023, three years difference and it's still 16. And I don't know, like, based on this graph, it's actually slightly lower than that. The first test was like 16.1, 16.2 and this one is like 15.8. But but I guess it's still like, insignificant difference. So 16 on both tests. And my chronological age has increased from 25 to 28. I'm actually, like, 28, so I'm almost 29. So based on this test, my DNH, my DNA methylation age, the aging rate is 0.56, which, yeah, is like the ninety ninth percentile of the speed of aging which means I'm, every year, every calendar year, I'm actually aging only 0.5 years. So, like, half a year. I'm not aging at least the DNA methylation age. So it's again it's I don't I'm gonna talk about later or like what's the difference between those things and the DNA methylation age is only like one of the hallmarks of aging. It's not going to tell you your complete picture. There's other factors as well that you need to consider, obviously, which we'll talk about. But, at least this one specific hallmark of aging, I'm doing excellent in. I'm 99 percentile of people and I'm only aging at, like, 0.5, rate. You son of a If you are interested in slowing down your biological age, then I'm looking for more people who want to reverse their biological clock and increase their health span. If you're interested, then email me the word health to info@seamlann.com and I'll send you the details. So does this test actually tell me my actual biological age? Well, it does tell you, like, a fraction of your biological age. And, I do think that it's worthwhile to consider that. It's worthwhile to pay attention to that. But, you have to, yeah, still realize that this is only one of the hallmarks of aging. It's not going to tell you like your entire biological age. Of course, it's better to have it lower than your chronological age. It would mean that, yeah, you're heading in the right direction and you are improving but even if it's slightly higher it doesn't necessarily mean that everything is wrong. Because the issue with these kind of tests is also that they can be very variable and they can be very sensitive to things like stress, inflammation and infections. So if you are sick for example then your age, your biological age will increase based on the test and once you recover it lowers down. So actually the same author, Horwath, Steve Horwath actually has done a study where they have shown that, the biological age, the DNA methylation clock, the DNA methylation age does increase during stress and infection. So if you had the virus or if you had something else, if you've just been the regular flu, the regular cold, then your age would probably increase. I didn't measure my age when I did get the virus but the point is that whenever you are doing like any of these kind of tests you need to, yeah, make sure that you haven't been sick, that you haven't had any recent infection and, a lot of the, let's say, the results that you see just reflect some aspects of, yeah, like your health status and your inflammation status. It doesn't really tell you, like, you know, you're you're still I personally I'm still 28 years old. It's just my body is, the inflammation levels, the DNA methylation patterns that test measures, that is associated with an age of 16. Of course, I could still die to various diseases. I could still get chronic diseases based on, like, some genetic factors or whatever, but my health status is generally, yeah, much healthier, 99 in the ninety nine percentile of my population. Is this the only thing that matters? You take the test and it's gonna pretty much predict your mortality? No. There's of course other things that you need to consider and I think that actually some of the other factors are more important than this test such as your blood work, what is your blood sugar levels, what is your hemoglobin a one c, what is your lipid profile, cholesterol, triglycerides. Actually, they are a lot more, you know, like, important in terms of predicting your mortality risk. Now, of course, if you have excellent blood work, if you have good blood work, then chances are your DNA methylation age will also be much lower than your chronological age. But if the DNA methylation test tells you that you're much younger than your chronological age but you still have poor blood work, you still have poor lipid profile, you still have bad liver enzymes, etcetera, then I would much rather base my, like, presumptions and predictions on the blood work because the blood work is gonna be more important. So what I think is that you should always focus more on the, like, trying to improve your blood work and optimize the blood work and then taking a test can be, like, an additional, like, a benefit to know some DNA methylation patterns as well. But the blood work is, first of all, is much cheaper. It's more easily accessible. You can do it, like, at your doctor. You can get the results immediately. The test, this is what I did. It takes, like, six to eight weeks to get the results. So the blood work is certainly much more important, more convenient and cheaper. Other important factors for assessing your longevity are the parameters of physical performance. So such as your gait speed, your grip strength, your overall body strength, your VO2 max and muscle mass, your body composition, like, if you are overweight, then that's certainly, like, a huge thing that accelerates your biological aging and at the same time, it also is a bigger predictor of mortality and getting different kinds of chronic diseases. Chill out. Overall, I think that the DNA methylation clock is certainly interesting. It does tell you some interesting data but because it's so sensitive, because it can change your lot if you have a recent infection, if you had some stress or whatever, you can easily skew the results and you can get a bad result when in reality you just need to recover from the stress. And this is coming from me who got the result with twelve years younger than my chronological age and I haven't like based on this taste, I haven't aged biologically over the last three years. I've stayed the same biological age which is a pretty remarkable achievement and even even me still I'm saying that you shouldn't like hyperfocus on this particular DNA methylation test.
