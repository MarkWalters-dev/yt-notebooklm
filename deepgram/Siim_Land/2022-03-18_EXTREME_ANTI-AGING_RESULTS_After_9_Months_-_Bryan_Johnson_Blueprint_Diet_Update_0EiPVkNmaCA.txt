Welcome back to the channel. My name is Siim Lund, and in this video, we're gonna talk about Brian Johnson again. So this is this, CEO who created his own anti aging protocol called The Blueprint that he's been following for nine months now. And I also made a video about him two two months ago in January where I, you know, go went through his initial routine and you can check it out. But now he basically published this recent blog post where he reveals his results after nine months of following this particular, blueprint. And we're gonna talk about the results that he's got and, yeah, just give my additional comments on it. Make sure to click like and subscribe as well for future videos about optimizing your health and performance. Do it. You should definitely watch the first part as well where, I basically go through his daily routine in a in a video that he made. But, yeah, it's like a plant based vegan, intermittent fasting, calorie restricted diet. And this again is one of the transformation that he's gone through. This was in 2017 and 2021 right now. And obviously, he has, you know, he wasn't obese before that, but he has lost a little bit of weight and, yeah, maybe he looks a bit more younger. Feel how soft my skin is. Alright. So let's check out his results after nine months of following this blueprint. And he has made this graph basically here or a table. His chronological age is 44 and but his biological age apparently is much lower. In the previous video that I made, his biological age was five years younger. And as you can see, he's also used these different markers to assess the biological age of his current situation after nine months and when he began initially. So NAD levels, NAD is important for aging. You do see a reduction in NAD levels when you get older and, basically, those adults or elderly who are healthier, they also have higher energy levels. So there is some association between there. And things like calorie restriction does increase NAD as well. So exercise as well. So healthy lifestyle increases NAD levels and his result has it's it's actually, you know, result already decreased from the biological age of 42 to 16. So he has the NAD levels of a 16 year old, which is quite nice. Because you know when you're 16 you do have like a ton of energy and you're able to do a lot of things. So 26 years younger are his NAD levels. And, yeah, he also does take nicotinamide driver's side, which we discussed in the previous video, which is an energy booster. But a lot of the, you know, things that raise energy levels are, you know, calorie restriction, fasting, not overeating, not being inflamed, exercising and sleep, and circadian rhythm optimization also raise energy. And I would argue that those are actually more much more powerful, for raising the NAD levels. I don't know what his, nicotinamide riboside dosage is right now. But, previously, she took if I'm not mistaken, he took, a few hundred milligrams the last time. So I think, yeah, the NAD boosters do help, but the most biggest factor for improving your ND levels come from the, the, circadian side exercise, calorie restriction, and immunoplastics because those, activities govern the recycling of NAD. So even if you take the NAD boosters, but your recycling pathways are offline, then you're not gonna have, like, a sustained level of elevation of, the NAD levels. So that's why, like, the, yeah, the foundations are most important for NAD levels. The boosters can be, like, a good thing. Heart health, if I'm not mistaken, then maximum heart rate. He had the heart rate of a 60 year old, but now he's 37, which is good. 23 years younger. White blood cell Initially he had the white blood cell age of 54 and now he's 33. Funny enough like you know fasting and exercise and saunas those all improve. The heart rate as well as the white blood cell basically function. Heart HRV, heart rate variability, same trend from the age of 55 to the age of 39. So things that boost HRV, saunas, cold exercise, fasting, not overeating, not being stressed out. Basically, those kind of things. Skin age went from the age of 40 to the age of 28, twelve years younger. I don't know how you would like assess the skin age. But, yeah, oral health gums from the age of 40 to the age of 35, five years health gums from the age of 40 to the age of 35, five years younger, nice. Epigenetics, multi clock average, so 40 from 47 to 43, a reduction, which is good. Inflammation from the age of 14 to the age of 10. So he already had inflammation levels in of a 14 year old and now it's, basically 10. A fitness score from 20 to 18 and epigenetics remained the same, 18. So that's the result. Winning. Snaps of he also took some sort of, like, a colon test. So he swallowed this pill that traveled through his intestinal tract and took 33,000 intestinal tract and they found no lymphoma, no Crohn's, no cancer pull ups or anything. Which is obviously good to know. I would imagine like most people wouldn't be able to take this kind of a test, but still. Okay. This is NAD increased from 26 to 36. So ten micromole increase dosing based upon measurement with nicotinamide riboside. Heart input includes max heart rate improved from 169 to 183. We have only done one echocardiogram, so that's a good improvement as well in the cardiovascular fitness. HRV raised from 37 to 54 with the Whoop. I don't use the Whoop. I have the Oura ring which also measures with HR V. Well the HR V, yeah, like, it's a very like subjective thing. Different numbers. I personally have a HRV with the o ring. I have, like, a 100. My a 100 is my average. And the maximum, if I, like, really recovered and rested, then I get, like, a 150, 180 sometimes. So I don't know, like, you know I haven't used the WHOOP, so I can't tell you, like, what is the difference between them. Maybe they have, like, a different system, but, yeah. Most important thing is to just pay attention to the trend of is your HRV improving or is it getting worse? And then base your, like, decisions upon that. Inflammation, so high sensitive CRP, 0.8 to 0.18, 80% reduction, which is pretty huge. Like, you already had pretty low inflammation. 0.8 is not is not, you know, unhealthy necessarily, but going to 0.18 is pretty good, like, pretty substantial reduction, 80 reduction, over the course of nine months. And what are the best things to lower CRP? I think fasting, calorie restriction, exercise, the diet obviously plays a huge part. He doesn't eat any like, you know, processed food or let's say, ultra processed food. He eats pretty, like, just, you know, plant based vegan diet, and, those are foods generally very anti inflammatory as well. So that's a good thing. My own personal HIV or not HIV, CRP is 0.1 as well, but I do eat, like, meat. Like, that's the main difference between my diet and his would be that I still eat, like, substantial amount of meat. And my protein intake is, like, you know, maybe two times bigger than his. I don't restrict carbs either. I do tons of good eating. I eat mostly once a day. I do exercise a lot. And, yeah. Maybe like maybe it's kind of for me it proves that I can get away with almost anything because of doing one meal a day. That's what my own personal opinion. Like even I can eat like a pretty suboptimal diet and I can still maintain an inflammation level of 0.1 and HRV of, you know, 100 and and a lower biological age of nine years younger even though I would be I could eat, let's say, not so healthy food sometimes or something like that. And that's mostly because of obviously color restriction. I'm still maintaining color restriction, but I'm also doing one meal a day. I'm having my sleep optimized and circadian rhythms optimized and those kind of things. But, yeah, just just just known comments about my own experience with this. Obviously, I don't know yet. Like, I haven't done this thorough assessment of the biology of the age as he has and other people, but, yeah, just that's what what I noticed myself. Disappointed. Overall, I think it's, you know, very awesome to see someone doing so thorough self quantification and tracking everything and actually sharing it with, the world. He does basically follow almost like the optimal lifestyle in terms of antiaging. I agree. Like, time machine eating, calorie restriction exercise, more like a plant based intake, I think is more beneficial for reducing the biological age and the markers of that. And, yes, interesting to see, okay, he has done this for nine months. How how low can he go? Or what's the end result? How far can he take this? Maybe he can, you know, reach the biological age of, you know, 20 or something. And more so like what's more interesting would be like how long can he maintain it. Like even let's say he plateaus at the biological age of 30, how long could he maintain it while his chronological age goes up? So can he still maintain the biological age of 30 while being chronologically 50 years old? That would be interesting to see. But, yeah. Definitely check out the first video that I made where he goes through his daily routine and basically food intake and supplements and those kind of things. I'll give my comments in that video as well. But, yeah, on that, thanks for watching this video. Make sure to click like, subscribe, notification bell as well. My name is Siim. Stay optimized.
