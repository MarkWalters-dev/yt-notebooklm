You've probably heard Brian Johnson say this. I am the healthiest person on planet Earth. Yeah. I have the best comprehensive biomarkers of Anybody. Anybody. And I just that's 40 that's 47 year olds. Bro, you earned it. Anybody in the world. I have the best biomarkers of anybody on the planet. So if there were an Olympic sport for health, I would be the gold medalist. Every time he says it, I'm like, yeah. That's not true. There are hundreds of people out there who have better biomarkers than Brian Johnson. I analyzed Brian's most recent test results and compared them to my own. 44 of them I have better results. Nine of them Brian has better results. And 12 of them were equal. I think that's a very one-sided victory. In this video, I'm going to walk you through all of the biomarkers and talk about them. Because number one, you will learn a lot about analyzing your own biomarkers. Number two, you'll know what's optimal for over 65 biomarkers. Number three, you'll generally know how to improve those biomarkers. And number four, it's just good content. As a disclaimer, I'm not saying that I'm the healthiest person in the world but I have factually better biomarkers than Brian Johnson. Here's a quick summary of the differences between our biomarkers. Brian has good metabolic health, but I have slightly better. Brian has suboptimal kidney function. Mine is excellent. We have semi equal liver values and the same liver fat percentage, but I have significantly lower visceral fat. We also have semi equal lipids, but mine are natural without medication. Brian's fitness, like strength and VO2max, are good for his age, but not elite by any means. Mine is significantly better and in the elite category. We both have normal hormone levels, but I have slightly better. Brian's pheno age, which is biological age based on blood markers, is 8.81 lower than his chronological age, but mine is eighteen point five years lower. That's a ten plus year gap. Now I know what you're thinking, CME is 31, Brian is 47, of course he has better biomarkers. Well that's exactly the point. Brian says he has the best biomarkers of anyone in the world no matter their age. That's just, that's 47 year olds. Bro, you earned it. Anybody in the world. I think it's obvious that the healthiest person in the world will always be someone who's like 16, 18 or 20 years old with all things being equal. Of course, some 47 year olds are healthier than some 18 year olds, but there are tens of thousands of 18 year olds that have better biomarkers than Brian Johnson. Now that this is out of the way, let's get started. So this all started a few weeks ago or a few months ago even when Brian Johnson says I have the best biomarkers in the world, I'm the healthiest person in the world and if anyone has better bar markers then they should post it. So here I am and let's get started with the fitness markers. So things related to physical fitness. VO2max. So Brian Johnson's VO2max is 54.2 which is good for his age. It's not elite even for 18 year olds or, you know, VO2max peaks when you're 18 years old. That's naturally when your VO2max should be the highest and that's not really an elite level for 18 year olds. Now it's good for 47 year olds but it's not elite for 47 year olds either. I know actually some people in their early 40s who don't do any cardio and their VO2 max is 51 or 52 or something like that so 54 isn't that big of a like a, you know, flex 54 VO2 Max. It's good. It's, what you would want to get at least over 50 is a good optimal range for VO2 Max, but it's definitely not in the elite category. And there's a few reasons why Brian's VO2 is a little bit lower, I'll talk about it later, but the short story, or long story short it's because of lower iron status and some of the sepsuedo anemia that he might have. I'll share about that a bit later. So, you you know, hemoglobin and blood oxygenation status, that plays a huge role in VO2max which essentially describes maximal oxygen consumption. So, yeah, my VO2max is 66. Now the test was done one and a half years ago when I got the result of 66, but I, right now it's probably still around like low sixties. My last test was low sixties. So it's still significantly higher than Brian Johnson and 60 a VO2 Max of 60 can be considered elite category for 18 year olds. Grip strength, so, this is just a dynamometer where you squeeze it and grip strength is a good general biomarker for overall health and overall muscle mass and muscle strength, especially for upper body strength. Now the thing is that, it's not going to be the okay I'm just gonna train my grip and I'm gonna live longer. It's more about, yeah, just having good grip means that you're generally healthier and you have a better diet and you just have slightly more muscle mass. His result, one hundred and thirty two pounds in his graph that he shared, I'm not sure if it reflects the sum total of both arms. Usually you do this test where you measure both arms and then you sum it up and then you get a result. I don't know if he was one arm or both arms. If this was both arms together, one hundred and thirty two pounds, then it would be pretty low. But I think it's just one arm. He's the best arm. Maybe right arm or left arm, I'm sure. So, yeah, we'll just presume it's just one arm. My grip strength from the dynamometer highest is a 150 pounds, that's around 68 kilograms, and my combined arms is 298 pounds or 67, 68 kilograms for both, arms. Bench press, bronze bench press, 240 pounds, which is around a 110 kilograms. It's, not, let's say, elite category again. Someone who is 18 year old, if they bench 240 pounds then, that's impressive for an 18 year old, but the problem here is that muscle strength doesn't peak when you're 18 years old. Someone who is in the thirties and forties will always be muscularly stronger than an 18 year old. That because of muscle maturity and just age in men muscle mass peaks mid thirties early forties. So, comparing your bench press to an 18 year old is not impressive because, 18 year olds don't have high bench or high squat or something like that. But let's say for a 47 year old, a bench of two forty, a 110 kilos, it's, you know, well above average. It's much average much higher than an average person, but it's not some power lifting, level strength. Of course, that's not his goal, but, yeah. Still, my best result, 300 pounds so that's a 135 kilograms and, that's considered not elite either so it's not some something that would be super impressive. It's significantly well above average. It's, I guess you could call it in the more advanced tier, lower level of advanced tier but it's not elite category for let's say advanced strength trainees. Leg press. So this test. Now this refers to this kind of a quarter depth leg press that is a you know, it's a medical test where you do the leg press but you don't go all the way to the depth. You just do like some of even before the knees are parallel so it's kind of a quarter leg press. And, Brian's result for that is eight hundred and fifty pounds which is, something like three hundred and eighty kilograms or something. Now these numbers are big, 850 pounds for the average person it sounds a lot but if you've ever gone to the gym then, you know, you can bench press or you can leg press 200 kilograms even in your first week at the gym. So a leg press of eight fifty isn't super significant and the leg press isn't the best I guess it's, you know, useful test for just measuring leg press or leg strength in isolation but, yeah, most gym goers actually don't consider the leg press to be some gold standard strength metric. But, yeah, that's what he used, 850 pounds. If I were to guesstimate then, eight fifty pound leg press, quarter leg press, would be the equivalent of maybe a 115 kilogram squat. So, that's again above average especially for a 47 year old. It's not, you know, useful to compare it to an 18 year old, but for an average 30 year old male who is, you know, let's say decently fit they can, leg they can squat a 120 kilos maybe. So this is, kind of an average result for a general fitness enthusiast in their thirties. My leg press result for this would be over a thousand pounds and, you know, I've done parallel squats but with a barbell 160 kilograms so my leg strength is significantly higher. My squat is actually one of my best lifts. My all time best squat, it wasn't below parallel, but it was, let's say, yeah, you know, almost the parallel was a 180 kilograms as I did that a few years ago, but right now I can do a 160 kilograms with a parallel squat. Lung strength, so this is measuring with, this device that you just exhale as hard as possible. It, just measures your lung strength. And if yeah. By the way, if you wanna see the receipts, the actual test results, then you can just head over to my Twitter. I'll put the link in the description. I have all the test results as well down there. So, yeah, you don't have to take my word for any of this. Body composition markers, so these are just muscle mass and, fat mass. So visceral fat, Brian's visceral fat mass, which, is the fat around the organs, is around, 0.56 liters, whereas mine is 0.25 liters. And, the interesting thing about that is this was after I was bulking so I was actually two kilograms heavier than I am right now and what I'm normally so, plausibly my visceral fat right now as I've lost some of that extra weight after the mini bulk, could be even lower. So my visceral fat on a DEXA scan was, zero was 54 grams and on the MRI, it, could be something like, let's say, a 100 grams, a 150 grams. A 100, let's say, a hundred hundred milliliters. So that's, you know, twice two to three times lower than a Brian Johnson's, which is, you know, quite interesting. So a visceral fat of 0.56 liters isn't, like a bad result. It's what you would consider within the normal range and if it were to be higher than that then it could be considered more concerning. So visceral fat of over 600 liters would be something, yeah, you need to lose it. Five, six, 0.56 liters is acceptable still but optimally you would wanna have it closer to 300 milliliters rather than five sixty milliliters. Liver fat, liver fat, also MRI, both of ours is 1.5% so that's low and that's good, good result. Muscle mass. So I haven't done an MRI for muscle mass or the MRI that I did didn't measure muscle mass, specifically, but, yeah, Brian Johnson's, muscle mass based on MRI is 18.1 liters, but, you know, I'm around five to six, even up to eight kilograms heavier than Brian Johnson and, I have similar body fat percentage so I I could say that, yeah, I probably have more muscle mass than Brian Johnson as well based on just the visible output and based on the visceral fat and, and the other body composition markers. So I can say that, yeah, I have better muscle mass as well. Now of course, I am younger so muscle mass in males peaks around mid thirties so I'm not at the peak yet. I'm 31 right now so I'm not even at the peak of what naturally is considered the peak of muscle mass in males, but still. So, yeah. Just this comparing it again to 18 year olds is, kind of not accurate because, muscle mass doesn't peak in 18 year olds. A 30 year old male has more muscle than an 18 year old athlete almost unless that's a strength athlete. So, yeah, that's it. Next we have bone density. So this is kinda interesting. Both of our bone density is quite high and there's two ways to go about it. So one, you can just look at the total bone density, I guess bone mass, and here I have slightly higher bone mass, so I have 1.541 grams per square centimeters whereas Brian's is 1.477 grams per square centimeters. So I have total amount of more bone mass. But if you were to look at it relative to age, which is used with his t and z score, then he has a a bit higher 2.9 versus mine 1.3. So that's a standard deviations above normal. So Brian's bone density is 2.9 standard deviations higher than what is normal for his age. So what is normal for a 47 year old. So that's a very high, bone density for his age. And mine is a 1.3 standard deviations higher than what's normal for a 30 year old, a 31 year old. Or I was I was 30 when I did that test, the bone density test. So, it just means, yeah, that both of our bone densities several standard deviations higher than normal but I have relatively speaking, or not relatively, but objectively speaking higher bone density. He has relatively speaking a higher bone density for his age if we were to look at just the age difference. Now if your bone density is lower, let's say your bone density is below zero standard deviations what's normal so that's, that's considered osteopenia and osteoporosis the lower it goes the higher the risk of fractures and the lower the bone density is. So if your bone density is less than zero then that's a concern. You would want to address that with, in most cases it has to just involve dietary intervention and resistance training exercise. So the reason both of us have high bone density is because of increased resistance training. Alright, moving on with inflammation and immune markers starting with homocysteine. Brian's is seven micromoles per liter so that's a good result, but it could be slightly lower. It's nothing something that you would want to be concerned about and optimal homocysteine is pretty much five micromoles per liter and, you know, it's very rare that it will be five but if it's above ten then that can be considered something to, you know, be more deliberate about. Usually it's gonna involve taking B vitamin complex supplementation, people who have poor methylation will have higher homocysteine, so higher homocysteine can predict heart disease or can be a causal factor for heart disease, damages to the blood vessels, etcetera. So you don't want to have high homocysteine, you don't want to have homocysteine above 10 and especially above 15 micromoles per liter. Both of our results are kind of optimal, Mine is slightly, lower. And, I did actually some specific things to lower my homocysteine from from even nine to 5.9 and, it involved trimethoglycine supplementation, two grams a day, and also hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which Brian does as well quite a lot, I think he has made many posts about that he takes hyperbaric oxygen therapy pretty regularly, so those things can actually lower homocysteine levels. HSCRP, so inflammation, both of ours are very low, 0.3 versus 0.1. Now, it might be that the test that he used just capped out at 0.3 so his CRP might also be 0.1, we don't know, and, you know, mine could also be lower than 0.1 because the test capped out at 0.1. I've also got 0.01 on one of the tests for my CRP so, it just depends a lot on what kind of lab you use. So but regardless, both of our CRP levels are close to zero or virtually zero and the optimal CRP level for health and longevity is as close to zero as possible. Pretty much less than 0.1 is what you want to get with CRP and the higher the CRP, especially if it's above one milligram per liter then that's something to try to intervene with. And usually it involves improving metabolic health, improving sleep, losing weight in a lot of cases and supporting the body's antioxidant defense with, you know, some supplements or hyperbaric oxygen therapy or exercise or something like that. TNF, that's another inflammatory marker. Both of ours is, low, close to zero, zero point eight. Glutathione, so this is, the body's considered the body's master antioxidant and, both of our results are in the two hundreds. Mine is slightly higher, two forty versus two nineteen. And, you know, this is something that I think doesn't, I guess, matter that much because, it can probably fluctuate a lot. If you got some infection recently, it can be lower. If you take glucosamine precursors like glycine n a c in large doses, if you take, if you take intravenous glutathione, you can, you know, in short term increase your glutathione status quite a lot. So this is kind of those markers that, you know, can fluctuate a lot and wouldn't be something to really worry about. Uric acid, so a kidney marker and inflammation marker. Brian 4.2, mine 5.14. Now this is a marker that some people have different opinions about, some people think that it should be as low as possible, other people think that, it should be somewhere, you know, in the moderate around five. I personally think that, yeah, too low uric acid can be a problem and, as as we talk about Ryan's kidney markers a bit later then it makes sense why it's a bit lower. So yeah, I would, you know, personally I would say that yeah, 5.14 is better than 4.2 but, some people might have different opinions. But regardless, in the context of Ryan's kidney markers, as we'll show it, isn't like the more optimal range. White blood cells so Brian's white blood cells 3.1 which is, below the reference range, so these are, immune cells and mine was a 4.8 which, is, optimal. So it's a healthy immune system. Now it might be low because of some recent infection, you recently were sick, let's say a few weeks ago even you had minor colds, some cough or or whatever it is, that can just reduce the white blood cells and it can stay low for a few weeks. So again, it's not an indication of some systemic health. It's just a short term marker that fluctuates quite a lot. The same with lymphocyte percentage. Three 38% is, below their reference range and it's quite low. Mine is 49.6, so a much better result. Alright. Metabolic health markers, hemoglobin a one c average blood sugar levels, Brian's is a 5.1%, mine is 4.9% and, you know, they're pretty equal but the 4.9 is still better than 5.1 and interestingly, you know, Brian is taking metformin and a few other supplements that lower blood sugar, I'm not, so, yeah, it's just an indication of better metabolic health, from my part. Triglycerides both are in the optimal range although mine is significantly better, actually 39 mgdl compared to 55. So, triglycerides as well, if they're lower, that's better. If your triglycerides are above 150, even, like, over over a 100, then that can be an indication of more, poorer metabolic health and, even some aspects of insulin resistance. Obviously, Brian isn't that. He's 55, which is good but below 50 is even better than above 50. And triglycerides usually can rise because of increased carbohydrate intake or also increased stat intake or just poor clearance of these, I guess, nutrients from the bloodstream. And, Brian isn't eating some high carb diet. He's eating actually quite low carb, lowish carb. I'm eating a lot carbs. I'm eating, you know, 200 to 300 grams of carbs. So, yeah, my triglycerides are significantly lower despite me eating that many carbohydrates, which is it just illustrates my very good metabolic health. Insulin, both are optimal. Insulin, optimally should be at like two, three, four less than five and, the lower it's not always that the lower the better. If you have zero insulin then that's probably also not, healthy. If it's very high, if it's above 15 then that can be indication of insulin resistance or, some, diabetes. But, yeah, both of our insulin levels are very good. Mine is slightly better. Blood glucose, so this is a CGM based continuous glucose monitor and, just looking at the fluctuations of all the blood sugar across the entire day twenty four seven, so my average was 81 milligrams per deciliter when I did the test while eating 300 grams of carbohydrates per day and Brian's was 91 milligrams per deciliter. And, you know, the reason why I am able to eat that many carbohydrates and maintain insulin sensitivity is because of my increased fitness, increased muscle mass, physical activity, all those things. Although I'm exercising less than Brian Johnson, I exercise at least maybe a few hours less per week than Brian Johnson. So, yeah, I just, you know, maybe it's my younger age, whatever it is, but I also think that insulin is a muscle that if you don't train you lose it, similar to other functions in the body. So if you're on a low carb, zero carb diet then you will create this pseudo insulin resistance state where your body isn't, you know, just loses the muscle to, let's say produce insulin slightly. Now it's not pathological insulin resistance because, it's more self induced or it's a pseudo insulin resistance, it's, whenever you were to be eating carbohydrates then you would have a harder time to clear the bloodstream from the glucose. So if you never use insulin then your body loses the ability to use it essentially. And by introducing more carbohydrates to my diet my blood sugar actually lowers because of increased insulin sensitivity. So a lot of, let's say, carnivore dieters out there as well, they have pretty bad blood sugar levels despite eating zero carbohydrates, right? So some, carnivore influencers, you can see their blood work, they have pre diabetic blood work, work, pre diabetic blood sugar levels which is not, you know, a good sign given the fact that they're eating zero carbohydrates. Now maybe it's not a big concern, we don't know, but it's just illustrates the point that if you never use insulin, you never eat carbohydrates, then you lose the insulin sensitivity slightly. Fasting glucose, Brian's ninety seven milligrams, mine eighty milligrams. 97 is a bit high. If it's over a 100 then that's more worrisome. One hundred and fifteen is prediabetes, one hundred and twenty five is considered diabetes. Now, the ninety seven might be because of, I don't know, he had some bad sleep or he was stressed out or something like that. So the fasting glucose can fluctuate a lot, obviously, but, you know, given his, let's say body composition of being leaner, eating a low color diet, eating not many carbohydrates then 97 is a bit high, especially if he's taking metformin as well. Cardiovascular markers, so heart disease markers ApoB seventy milligrams for Brian, mine fifty eight and I'm not taking any lipid lowering medications or anything like that. My ApoB is low just through diet changes. So, I eat a lot of fiber, I probably eat like forty-fifty grams of fiber a day and the fiber helps with, yeah lipids, ApoB and cholesterol and I'm also eating less saturated fat, I'm eating more, let's say, you know, the only fats I eat is olive oil, fish, walnuts usually and, from meat, eggs as well. But I eat a lot of fiber that helps to bind to the lipids and lower them. And also triglycerides, the increased fiber can help with blood sugar and increased helps with lowering triglycerides as well. So ApoE, what's optimal, you know, 70 is already pretty optimal but 58 is better, like, if your ApoB is forty, fifty, 60 then your risk of atherosclerotic plaque accumulation is quite low. If your ApoB is over 120 then the risk of that is slightly higher. But, yeah, 58 is much better than 70 in this scenario. Apo a one, so that's another apolipoprotein. Both of our results are quite optimal. Now he has a a few different results, a 133, a 143 range. Mine is a 140 in my last test result. So I would say that they are kind of equal, in that regard. LDL as well, Brian has a few different results. His lowest has been 47. His last was 68. Mine last one was 58. So that's also both are, I would say, equal. But, yeah, he is taking some sort of lipid lowering drug if I'm not mistaken. I'm not sure exactly which one or if it's a 100% true, but I've I think I've seen some posts or heard that he is taking some lipid lowering drug, whereas I'm not, taking anything. Total cholesterol, both are quite optimal, both are quite equal, 125 to a 130. HDL cholesterol, Brian is 51. I'm 62 and, so, HDL cholesterol is a better marker of insulin sensitivity than it is of cardiovascular disease risk. So a low HDL is usually a sign of, insulin resistance and diabetes. So, it's not that the higher the better. Actually, excessively high HDL is, and is associated with increased heart disease risk as well so an HDL of fifty and sixty two, they're both optimal in that sense, 62 tends to be a bit better and it probably is because of my improved insulin sensitivity. LP little a, so this is a genetically influenced heart disease marker, lipoprotein. And, you know, obviously there's a genetics involved here so I have lower result. Now these are different units. Brian's is twenty three point eight nanomoles per liter minus three point one milligrams per deciliter. But if you were to convert this three point one milligram to nanomoles then it will be something like seven or eight nanomoles. So even if you were to do the conversion it would my my result would be lower. So, yeah, it doesn't matter which conversion you use. So, 23 is, is not bad. There are some people who have a hundred, hundred fifty, 300 even. So, those individuals are at a significantly higher risk of heart disease due to genetics. A result of 23.8 isn't, yeah, like, very bad but, my result of, let's say, seven nanomoles if you were to do the conversion is, significantly better. Now there's genetics involved here so, yeah, you can't, you know, you can't point at any specific lifestyle or dietary intervention here. Oxidized LDL, so thirty one nanograms per milliliter for Brian and for me my result was, below the reference range which means that I have almost non detectable oxidized LDL which is, you know, very good. That it means I have, you know, zero inflammation and zero oxidation of cholesterol in my body and a result of 31 isn't, yeah, it's, you know, it's not catastrophic or alarming but, yeah, it's higher than you would expect from someone who is following a very pristine lifestyle. BMP, so this is a cardiovascular marker. It reflects heart health, especially heart stress. I haven't measured this specific marker myself. I've tried to measure it. I looked at different labs even in Estonia, in India. None of the labs actually got the specific test of BMP but I got measured what's called NT Pro BMP which is not the same marker but it's a kind of a like a pseudo similar marker and you can't convert it. So you can't convert my result to the BMP of brands. So, if you were to, you know, do some sort of a conversion you can use like chattbd.gov. If you were to do the conversion, although it's not possible, what would it be like? So, you know, that will give you, like, a result of around three to twelve picograms per milliliter for me and 18 for Brian. So I would say, yeah, I think we're equal in that sense. And it's unlikely that I have some sort of cardiac stress given that I have much better heart markers than Brian. So, you know, case in point, resting heart rate. Brian's best result is 39 that he's had over the last few weeks. I've seen his average is 48. Mine best is 35. It's actually been, you know, 34 as well in the in the in the past, and on average is 39, 38, something like that. Now, of course, if your resting heart rate is zero, you're dead. So it's not that the lower the better, but there is a linear association between resting heart rate above 45 and increased risk of all causality in a meta analysis involving over 1,200,000 individuals. So a higher resting heart rate a resting heart rate that's above normal or above average, you know, the average person's resting heart rate is too high. The average person has poor fitness, poor cardiovascular health, and their average resting heart rate is also too high. So, a lower resting heart rate is generally better marker of better heart health. And, my result of 35, 39 is, yeah, better result than, than Brian's. And if it's if it were to be lower than that, I think 39, 35 is kind of the lowest you want to go. If your resting heart rate is 30 then, you know, it might be might be too low. HRV, heart rate variability, so this measures the interval between heartbeats. Brian's is, around fifties, mine is, over a 100, so yeah, it's significantly higher. Now there is some genetic differences in HRV as well. Some individuals just have their HRV capped at 60 or 70, whatever it is. But, generally speaking, a higher HRV, a 100 is better than 50, generally speaking. Blood pressure, both our blood pressure is quite optimal. You know, slightly lower than average is better so less than 100 and twentyeighty is slightly better but you also have to obviously look at all the other markers. If you have very low blood pressure, you're malnourished, you have poor grip strength, low bone density, low VO2 max then this low blood pressure can be a sign of just frailty and, increased risk of death because of that. But in the context of good fitness and good cardiovascular health a blood pressure of, you know, 110 is a a better result than a 120 in most cases. Now blood pressure also fluctuates. On some nights or some days it can be a 120, others a 125, others a 105, 110. So, yeah, just don't take each individual marker at face value. And how do you lower blood pressure? Just, you know, general fitness, general improved heart health with I like saunas, I take a lot of saunas. I've been taking saunas since I was, you know, two years old. So I've taken a sauna for, you know, thirty years of my life almost and, I think Brian has started to do some saunas over the last few weeks or months only. So, yeah, maybe his heart metrics will improve, maybe his HRV will also increase. I do think that the sauna has a pretty big effect on HRV, especially if you combine it with cold therapy, you do the hot and cold back and forth that just, you know, feels amazing and, helps with HRV and, resting heart rate as well. Omega-three index. So this should reflect the omega-three fats in your red blood cells and an omega-three index of over 6.5% is kind of the threshold for lower mortality risk compared to a lower score and, you wanna get it at least, like, eight percent is a little more like a sweet spot. He's, Brian's is nine point nine, mine is nine percent, so he has he has a slightly better result. And the way you increase this percentage is through, omega three supplementation, eating more omega three foods, or yeah. So there is some argument to me that omega-six fatty acids from nuts and seeds or something like that can also, let's say, downgrade your omega-three index but, I haven't seen like very clear proof of that. It's more about, yeah, just how much omega-3s are you eating. That's the biggest factor. RDW, red cell distribution width, both are optimal. His recent result was 12.1%, average 11.5%, mine, 11.9%. So I would say, yeah, we're pretty equal in that scenario. MCV, that's a mean corpuscular, volume. Brian's result is a 101, mine is 91, and, mine is better. Over 100 is too high. If it's over 98 even then that can be considered a bit, too high. Mine is actually in the end, like a sweet spot. Hemoglobin, so this is, yeah, just reflects blood oxygenation status and iron status, so Brian's is a bit low, 13.6 grams per deciliter and mine is 14.7 grams per deciliter. So I mentioned earlier that this is one of the limiting factors to his VO2max, which is my theory that, yeah, he has lower iron status, lower hemoglobin status because of his, plant based diet and apparently he's not supplementing iron either, So, his hemoglobin is a bit low and that limits his VO to max, so he just can't push himself as hard due to the low, oxygenation status. So that's actually below the reference range. So something like 14.5 would be quite good, minus four 14.7. But, if you were to really try to maximize VO two max, you would wanna get your hemoglobin to something like 15.5 even. Platelets. So this reflects blood clotting and, Brian's result of 165 is a bit too low. So you don't wanna have zero platelets because it means that your blood isn't clotting. That increases risk of bleeding. So you wanna have healthy amount of platelets. Of course, if your platelets are too high, if they're above three fifty then, that can be, concern for blood clots, thrombosis, things like that, but a result of 165 is a bit too low. So a sweet spot would be, like, 200 to two hundred fifty, two hundred to 300. It's kind of a sweet spot. MCH, so this is a mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and, Brian's is 32.8 picograms minus 29.4. I guess, yeah, I would consider them equal. Creatinine so this is a kidney marker and, this is quite interesting. Brian's creatinine levels are 1.21 milligrams per deciliter which is above the reference range. Mine is a zero point eight milligrams per deciliter. And, you know, the optimal range for creatinine is something like zero point six to 0.9, maybe one at the most, but if it's above one then I would consider that suboptimal. Now, it's interesting because usually what raises creatinine status or creatinine levels are muscle mass, physical exercise because, it reflects protein breakdown. Right? If you break down a lot of protein due to higher muscle mass or exercise, you will have higher creatinine in the blood or eating also higher protein, especially animal protein that tends to influence, creatinine levels. But for Brian, you know, he's not eating animal protein, he's, has less muscle mass than me, so he has five, six kilograms less muscle mass of lean tissue than me. And, the only thing that could explain his increased creatinine level, would be his exercise which he does a bit more than me but, you know, it's not like I don't exercise at all. I exercise almost every day. I exercise shorter than him and I in total I exercise maybe two hours less per week than him. So, it's quite interesting. And I have more muscle mass, I eat more protein, I eat more animal protein and I have significantly lower creatinine levels. Now he is taking creatine, I think he's taking like ten grams of creatine, but it shouldn't raise his creatinine levels that high, the creatinine creatine supplementation. I've taken also creatine in the past, I took, you know, twenty grams, you can check out my video, I took twenty grams of creatine and, and my creatinine levels were only like 0.94, 0.95 or something like that. So even at that case my creatinine levels never went that high. So I don't think he has, you know, kidney disease, but, his creatinine levels are surprisingly high, despite not eating any animal protein, despite having less muscle mass. You know, he doesn't have a ton of muscle mass, right, he is low body fat and he's, muscular but he's not he doesn't have mass, if that makes sense. So the only thing is, the very high amount of exercise that he does, which I think is, unnecessarily high amounts of exercise in the context of, creatinine levels. Cystatin c, this is a better kidney marker and he's at zero point eighty seven milligrams per deciliter minus 0.67, he's a bit, high. Now it's not kidney disease high. Right? But, optimally, it should be less than, 75 or less than seven even even better. And mine is, much better. Now EGR, so EGR, glomerular filtration rate, so it's a umbrella kidney health marker and, his, based on the creatinine calculation, was 74. And if you were to do the estimation of EGR from cis statin c, his result would be ninety nine. So less than 100 would indicate suboptimal kidney function less than 90 is first stage of kidney disease. Now based on creatinine status, yeah, he has kidney disease, but again I don't think he has actually kidney disease, it's, because of the increased creatinine due to excessive exercise. So, his yeah. Let's say his creatinine is 99. If we were to calculate it from cystatin c, it's still much lower than my 112 calculated from cystatin c. So mine 112 is, you know, peak kidney health in that sense. Albumin, so this, most abundant protein in the blood usually reflects a nutrition status, 4.5 for Brian, mine 4.6, now I have slightly higher. It's not a huge difference, but, yeah, if it were to be lower than that, so let's say 4.3, then he would probably just need to increase his calorie intake. So we both have slightly lower albumin compared to, let's say, someone who were to be eating a ton of calories because of, you know, we obviously don't eat insane amounts of calories to maintain lower body fat percentage. Now 4.6 is, I think, like a sweet spot, 4.6 to 4.8 is a sweet spot, 4.5 is something I think, yeah, just reflects nutrition intake. Total protein, so these are other proteins in the blood. Total protein at Brian's is 5.9 grams per deciliter. That's a bit low. Mine, 6.73. Globulin, another protein marker, Brian's is 1.4. Mine is 2.31. So, again, his globulin is a bit, too low. BUN blood urea nitrogen, the kidney marker, both are, optimal. Mine is slightly, lower. Vitamin b twelve and, this is in the kidney category because usually b twelve levels I put it here because, Brian's kidney so Brian's b 12 levels are above the reference range, they're actually quite high, it's twice as high as mine and, you know, higher b 12 isn't always a good sign because so your kidneys filter things including b vitamins and if you have elevated B12 levels then that could be indication that your kidneys aren't working optimally and they're not filtering out the excess. So he is taking obviously a B vitamin complex or B supplementation because he's not getting it from, from the plant foods so, his B12 is very high because of the supplementation plus the kidney is not filtering it out. That's my analysis of that situation. And, elevated B12 levels are actually associated with increased mortality because of the kidney component. So very high B12 levels isn't a good sign. The same with folate, so he's probably supplementing folate, he's over 20, that's also a bit too high above the reference range, -17.4, that's in the reference range and optimal. What will be some improvements for his kidney markers? As I said, there's probably some component of exercise, excessive exercise, raising his creatinine levels but, you know, it's beyond the creatinine. There's also the elevated B12, elevated folate, low protein status, so, I suspect there is something in his supplementation or pharmaceuticals that worsens his kidney health. Maybe lithium, maybe something else, maybe some other mystery, compound he's taking currently. So, yeah, these are the reasons why he has the kidney status, that he has. And, yeah, it could be better if his creatinine was lower and, this total protein would be also higher. Perhaps if we were to increase protein intake, he would actually see an improvement in kidney markers, which, has been documented to be possible. Liver markers, so, yeah, GGT, eight minuteus ten point seven, he has a little bit better but both are pretty optimal. GGT below 15 is optimal. Now if your liver enzymes are also zero then I don't think that's healthy either and with all these other liver enzymes lower isn't always better although some people, you know, would like to think that. So because there is a certain amount of, let's say physiological stress your body needs to maintain health and if you, let's say, have very low liver enzymes but you have poor VO2 max then a higher VO2 max is based on the evidence, much better indication of long term health than these very low liver markers. But, yeah, GGT, both of ours are optimal. Brian's eight to minus 10. AST, both are optimal for us. Mine is a little bit lower, 24 versus 23. ALT, Brian's is a little bit lower, 21, twenty two twenty two, so I guess, you know, there's no real difference significant difference. Brian's ALP result, so that's another liver enzyme that is also involved in inflammation. And, Brian's is 77 minuteus 51. So 77 is a bit high. At 51 you could consider it the sweet spot. I don't think an ALP of below 45 is actually that good because again if you have low ALP you probably also have low strength and low VO2max because you're not really doing anything that would raise liver enzymes. You know, exercise can raise ALP levels and liver enzymes and, if you were to look at the evidence then VO2max and grip strength are a better indication of long term health than ALP or some other liver enzyme. So yeah, 51 I think is actually the sweet spot in my opinion. 51 to 55, below 60 at least is a sweet spot. 45 to 45 to 60, let's say, for ALP is a sweet spot. 77 is a bit too high. Now again, it might be because of his, very high amounts of exercise, So, yeah, that could explain it. Because he's not, you know, drinking alcohol, his other liver enzymes are fine, so the only thing that explains it is, the exercise. Bilirubin, both optimal and, yeah, nothing to really add there. Now if people have elevated liver enzymes, the biggest reason for that is usually alcohol intake or excess sugar intake. If you improve your metabolic health, you, lower your blood sugar levels with diet, exercise, weight loss, those kind of things, then you will also see improvements in liver health. But, remember the visceral fat component, so, there's specific things that help with visceral fat loss, so dietary polyphenols, green tea, olive oil, vegetables, berries, those kind of things, a high polyphenol diet lowers, visceral fat and will help with liver enzymes by doing that as well and help with liver fat. Plus there's the component of glycine supplementation which I'll talk about later as well when I try to improve Brian's results, but, yeah, the component of glycine, higher amounts of glycine help with lowering liver fat and visceral fat compared to methionine. But Brian isn't taking the glycine that much. He takes only one gram of, glycine, which I think is a bit too low. Hormones. So testosterone, Brian seven twelve, see him as seven six seven. You know, they're both in the same ballpark. Mine is, slightly higher free testosterone. So this is the bioactive form of testosterone that's more important than regular testosterone. Bryon 8.8, CEMA 13.8. So I have significantly higher free testosterone. And the reason for that is SHBG. So SHBG, sex hormone binding globulin, is a binding protein that binds to testosterone and if you have high SHBG like Brian, 56.2 then, you end up with a lower free testosterone. So the optimal SHBG would be below 50 which mine is, 47 and, usually what raises SHBG is calorie restriction, carbohydrate restriction, iron accumulation, and, liver damage. So for Brian, he doesn't have high iron levels. He actually has low iron levels, and he doesn't have, you know, liver damage either per se so, the high SHBG is because of the severe calorie restriction that he has and the lower carbohydrate intake. So you can you know, I'm also not eating a ton of calories, I'm not in massive calorie surplus, otherwise I wouldn't maintain leanness that much, but the key here is, insulin signaling. So insulin is a pro anabolic hormone and insulin signals the body that there's abundance of nutrients. So, by being on a low carb diet you see an increase in the SHBG because of the carbohydrate restriction. So there's very well documented high protein, low carb diets raise SHBG levels and they lower testosterone levels in men, whereas even low protein, high carb diets tend to lower SHBG levels and they end up with higher testosterone levels as a result of that. Now I'm not eating low protein, I'm eating semi high protein but also high carb intake so that's why I have, you know, in the optimal range for SSBG and, increased free testosterone levels as well. LH, FSH, both are optimal and both are in the same ballpark. DHEA is a precursor to testosterone. They're, yeah, in the same ballpark, Brian's is slightly more increased, two thirty versus two fourteen, but, you know, I have better testosterone. So DHEA only matters to the extent of testosterone. You know, DHEA alone isn't that big of a concern, it's more about the actual testosterone. IGF-one, so, this is pretty relevant to longevity. Very high IGF-one levels are associated with cancer, very low IGF-one levels are associated with increased risk of neurodegeneration and dementia later in life because you need IGF-one, you need this growth for neurons, but very high IGF one levels can also be involved in, cancerous growth. Both our IGF one levels are on the lower end. Usually, yeah, around a 100. The lowest I've been has been like 94, Brian's is also something like 90, a 100, something like that so we're equal in that scenario. Now some people are okay is it good or bad for longevity? So the sweet spot for longevity is something like 110 to one hundred and twenty nanograms per milliliter of IG-one but both of ours is slightly lower and, you know, I'm okay with that, I think it's actually good because it reduces the risk of cancer and, I'm in no risk of frailty in that sense because I have high bone density, high bone muscle mass, good, nutrition status. You know, I don't think it's a concern for Brian either because his bone density is high, he has, you know, decent muscle mass, so he's not at risk of frailty, directly. So, I think personally I consider an IGF-one of one hundred ngmL to be, pretty good and, more optimal for longevity because of the reduced cancer risk. But if it were to be lower than that, let's say 50, then that could be that could be too low. And, you know, how do you increase IGF-one? You just eat more calories, more protein, more carbohydrates and the key part is also more frequently. What I've found is that how much protein or how much carbs I eat has no effect on my IGF-one levels. The, the way I achieve low IGF-one is, through intermittent fasting. Eating less often tends to result in lower IGF-one in my experience. And, you know, Brian does also some aspects of time restricted eating. Vitamin d, seventy seven nanograms per milliliter for Brian. Mine is a 56. Now 77 could be too high. You know, he's taking, vitamin d supplement probably and, you know, they could be too high. So very high vitamin D levels are associated with increased mortality as well but, it depends how you achieve it. If you were to achieve such high vitamin D levels through natural sunlight then it probably isn't gonna be a concern. But, in his case he's, achieving it with supplementation, he's not, you know, sunbathing or something like that so, in that case it might be too high but, yeah, depends on a lot of other biomarkers. T h a TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone, both are optimal for us. So Brian's is, lower but he's taking some thyroid medication, which improves his thyroid function. So, if he were to not take the thyroid medication, his, thyroid markers would be much lower and much worse. But, yeah, because of the calorie restriction. Mine is, slightly higher. It means that my body is signaling the production of thyroid hormones, but they're not very high. They're still in the normal range. Free t four, both in the same ballpark, 1.48 to 1.32. So in the hormone section, you know, the biggest takeaway would be that, yeah, the presence of nutrients, especially presence of carbohydrates and insulin, plays a big role in, sex hormones. So, carbohydrate restriction, calorie restriction, even protein restriction can result in low sex hormones. Alright, now let's move on with some of the experimental tests and, yeah, these involve some of these biological age tests and those kind of things do need in PACE, so this is the rejuvenation olympics test that measures your speed of aging or as it's called it's a speed of aging test, but I don't think it actually measures your biological age or your speed of aging, it's just a label that is attached to the test. In reality this test measures just acute inflammation. If you look at, you know, my own results, Brian's results, if you look at some of the studies on these tests then you can see that they fluctuate a ton. They can be higher in the morning, lower in the evening, they can fluctuate day by day. Immediately after exercise they're worse, before exercise they're better, whatever it is, like they just fluctuate a lot so you really can't make any conclusions about your biological aging with this test because of the fluctuation. And they're also unpredictable. You can follow the, you know, very healthy or very optimized lifestyle, you can sleep a lot, no stress, no exercise, whatever it is, and get a worse result just out of randomness. So, yeah, I've tasted a few of these maybe four times and they give quite a lot of different fluctuations. Matt Cabernain, who's a PhD in geroscience, longevity science, and he did tests, two of the tests at the same time with multiple different companies all gave different results. So how is it possible if you test at the same time and you get different results? So it doesn't make sense or it makes sense if the test is wrong, if the test isn't actually measuring what you think it's measuring. But result regardless, you know, Brian's best result for this test, 0.54, is average 0.67. So the so the interesting thing here is that Brian tests this test a lot, like several times a month. Here in the document he had he tests 25 times this test per year. So, obviously he's gonna get a lot of different results. And, if you test long enough you're gonna get a result like 0.54, you're gonna get a result of 0.45, 0.3, whatever it is. If you test long enough you're gonna get the result that you want. So, you know, I've taken, yeah, four times in my life this test. Brian tested 25 times a year and of course he gonna get whatever test result that he wishes. Yeah. My best result was 0.62, and, yeah. I just stopped doing the test because I think it's kind of useless and it doesn't really tell you what people think it does. Telomere length. So I haven't test tested this in, you know, more accurate way. I haven't done a specific telomere test. I got a telomere test result from the Dunedin, PACE test. It was part of the component, but I don't think it was an actual most accurate telomere test. But that test result gave me 7.9, but I haven't done yet, like, a proper telomere test, Branson 11.4. Now here as well, you could argue that very long telomeres can be actually not good. So telomerase, this enzyme that grows telomeres is also involved in cancer, so excessive telomere growth is a hallmark of cancer or you don't want to have super long telomeres. It's more about the speed of telomere attrition, how fast the telomeres, shorten is what, matters and what you want to pay attention to. Next, we have PhenoAge. So this is the biological age estimation based on 10 blood markers created by doctor Morgan Levin. And, yeah, it involves tests like creatinine, glucose, CRP, lymphocyte percentage, white blood cells, RDW, alkaline phosphatase and MCV. So you put these things into like a calculator, you can find it online, just Google pheno age calculator, you can do at the test and it estimates your biological age phenotypic age based on those blood markers. And you also need to put your chronological age because the chronological age actually has a huge influence on the test results because if you're 60 years old it's very unlikely you have a biological age of 15 as a phenotypic age, but if you're 35 or 30 like me, you can have a phenotypic age of 15 because the gap between 15 and 30 is much smaller than 65 and 15, if that makes sense. So yeah. Because of that reason, you know, Brian's as we said, he had very high creatinine, he had slightly high glucose, he had low white blood cells, low lymphocyte percentage, all those factors resulted in his, female age of 8.81 years lower than his chronological age. So his phenotypic age is, 39, something like that. Mine, 18.5 lower. So, it's 12. So, there's a eighteen year difference between my phenotypic age and my, chronological age and a eight point eight year difference in Brian's phenotypic age and his chronological age. Now if you were to put the same numbers that I had, my creatinine, my glucose, my lymphocyte percentage, my CRP and all those markers into Brian's calculator and you put his chronological chronological age of 47, then his pheno age would be twenty twenty years lower. He would be 27 phenotypically. So as you can see the chronological age plays a huge role in influencing the female age. If you are someone who is 45, 55, and you have very good creatinine levels, very good glucose levels, the delta or the gap between your female age and your chronological age can be much higher. Now it would be very hard for me as a 30 year old to have a pheno age that's 20 lower than my chronological age. It would be extremely hard for me to achieve a pheno age of 10. Right now, based on this this test result, the latest ones, it would be 12, which is possible as of just shown, but it would be much harder for me to have a pheno age of 10 with a gap of twenty years. But it is possible for Brian because, you know, my if you were to put my results to his chronological age, my creatinine, my glucose, my CRP, my lymphocytes, etc, then he would get a phenol age of 20 lower. And, interestingly there's this website longevityworldcup and, it just, is a kind of similar leaderboard as the rejuvenation Olympics but it's more crowdsourced or more independent and they use the pheno age based calculations and Brian's result wouldn't put him in the top 60 people in the longevity world cup. Meaning that there are at least 60 people who have enrolled in this competition who have better biomarkers than Brian. So, you know, Michael Osgarden, who's a friend of the channel, he's been on a podcast, his result is 23.9 lower. So he's, I think he's 55 chronologically, so his, PhenoAng is 40 sorry, 30, something like that. 32 is his PhenoAge and that's a significantly better result than Brian. But, yeah, Brian's PhenoAge score based on his latest result wouldn't put him in the top 60 of people in the Longevity World Cup which just means that there's a ton of people out there who have much better biomarkers than Brian. I have better biomarkers than Brian. Michael Lostgarden has better biomarkers than Brian and, 59 other people have better biomarkers based on the pheno age at least than Brian. Now they probably haven't measured as comprehensively as Brian yet Brian has measured, I don't know, a few 100 markers. These individuals probably have measured maybe a few dozen at most but the FeNOH which is a umbrella marker for overall it obviously has its flaws, you can have high blood sugar on one day, you can have low lymphocyte, low white blood cell because of infection or something like that, so it obviously fluctuates as well, similar to the Dunedin Paste Test, but it's a bit more practical because it includes 10 other biomarkers. It includes creatinine, it includes CRP, ALP, RDW, all those things that you can know what to focus on. Whereas with the Dunedin PACE test you don't really know what you need to focus on if you get a result because the test can obviously fluctuate quite a lot. Alright? So I went through all these markers, over 65 of them. My general consensus or analysis of his markers is that, you know, he doesn't have bad markers. A few of them are worse than others but he's not based on the blood markers in some sort of bad health. He has above average health compared to an average 45, 47 year old, even an average, you know, 40 year old, 35 year old, he has better markers than those individuals but they're not, you know, the best in the world. I've just factually shown you that I have, you know, significantly better markers, 44 versus nine. That's an overwhelming majority of markers I have better than him. And on top of that there's, you know, 59, 60 people on the longevity world cup that beat him on the pheno age test. So there we have it, there's like dozens of people who have better biomarkers than Ryan and, you know, the claim that he has the best biomarkers in the world is just I guess it's just marketing. There's the saying that if you repeat a lie long enough then it will become true. So I feel like that's the strategy here, you just repeat this long enough and eventually people will believe it. So, you know, for a layman, brand's markers sound very impressive and scientific. For someone who understands blood markers and understands what's optimal like me and many others like Michael Lustgarten, other PhDs, other doctors then for them, you know, they're not very impressive. They're better than average but they're not insanely amazing I reversed my age by twenty five years, ten, fifteen years. They're, yeah, better than average, but they're not insanely impressive. So there you have it. I just made this video because Brian repeatedly claimed I have the best biomarkers in the world. I'm the healthiest person in the world. I just, you know, someone had to put a stop to this and factually show that it's not the case. And like I said there's dozens, hundreds of people probably out there that have better biomarkers than him as well. If you want to know the full details of what I do for my longevity and overall health then I've got an evidence based longevity routine video that you can watch next.
