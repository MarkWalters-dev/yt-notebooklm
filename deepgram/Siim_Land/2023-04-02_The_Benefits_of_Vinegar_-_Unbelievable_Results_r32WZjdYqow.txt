Apple cider vinegar is quite popular and many people use it to improve weight loss and blood sugar management. But are those effects of apple cider vinegar actually real? In this video, I'm gonna talk about whether or not you should take apple cider vinegar every day and what are the benefits. Do it. I think a good place to start with is a 2020 meta analysis on vinegar consumption on glycemic control in, adults with type two diabetes. And they did find that among about three seventeen patients, using the, apple cider vinegar was beneficial for fasting blood sugar levels and hemoglobin a one c, which reflects the average blood glucose levels over the past few weeks. This meta analysis review extends the evidence on the beneficial effects of vinegar on glycemic control as measured by hemoglobin a one c and fasting blood glucose. Clinicians could incorporate vinegar consumption as part of their dietary advice for patients with diabetes. And that is the most powerful effect of apple cider vinegar or any kinds of vinegar, like white vinegar, etcetera, they all have beneficial effects on glycemic control and managing blood sugar levels as well as lipids. And, there are, like, multiple, you know, mechanisms why vinegar can lower your blood sugar levels. These mechanisms include, one, activation of the free fatty acid receptor, two, receptors localized in the antero endocrine l cells of the intestinal lumen leading to increased glucagon like peptide one GLP one secretion. So, yeah, like GLP one is this, incretin as it's called. It's like insulin analogous to insulin that helps with insulin secretion and helps with actually suppressing glucagon. So it lowers your glucose production by the liver and, with the increase of insulin it will also help to clear the bloodstream. So I mean, insulin isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's actually part of the reason why people who have diabetes stay with high blood sugar levels is that they don't produce enough insulin. And making your body produce insulin with these insulin sensitizing agents and mimetics or GLP one agonists, for example, like vinegar essentially, then that will have a positive effect on the blood glucose levels as well. Number two is AMPK activation which, is this, you know, is an energy sensor that promotes ketosis and fat burning as well. So you burn through fatty acids as well. And many people don't know actually that diabetes also results from elevated lipotoxicity. So too high free fatty acids in the blood pretty much suppress insulin, production and, damage the pancreatic beta cells as well, which is part of the reason why people develop diabetes like this lipotoxicity, so too high triglycerides in the blood. And, with apple cider vinegar you basically help to burn through those, triglycerides and fatty acids. Number three, lowering of free fat acid in circulation. So part of that reason potentially leading to improved insulin sensitivity. Number four, increased blood flow to the peripheral tissues. And number five, increased satiety leading to lower food intake. So obviously, calorie intake is also quite important when it comes to managing your blood sugar levels and risk of obesity and diabetes overall. And another two thousand seventeen meta analysis or clinical trials found that vinegar can be effective in reducing postprandial glucose and insulin levels. So postprandial means after a meal. So whenever you eat, then naturally your blood sugar levels would rise to a certain extent depending on the glycemic index and glycemic load of the meal as well as your particular insulin sensitivity. So if you eat, let's say, a lot of carbohydrates, then, yeah, your blood sugar levels are gonna be much higher after eating a meal. But there's also the things that your basal insulin sensitivity determines that. How much muscle you have, whether or not you're sedentary, whether or not you have exercised, or whether or not you take apple cider vinegar, for example, all those things, you know, determine the postprandial glucose levels. And having too high postprandial glucose levels for too long after a meal, it is associated with increased risk of diabetes and even coronary artery disease as well. So you don't wanna have like a very abnormal, chronically elevated blood sugar and insulin level after eating. So it's better to kind of lower it down as fast as possible. You don't need to like lower it immediately like taking like some sort of a drug or whatever, but, within a few hours your blood sugar level should be normalized even if you eat a relatively large meal. And there are actually studies showing that combining vinegar with a high carb meal like white bread or potatoes or cereal or whatever, ice cream, whatever it is, that's food that is gonna raise your blood sugar quite high with a high glycemic index and combining the vinegar with that meal actually lowers the the glucose response, the the postprandial glucose response by up to 50% in those meals. So as you can see from this image then, vinegar is this white square and it, pretty much lowers or results in much lower incident and glucose levels or or glucose area under the curve compared to a placebo. Vinegar or peanut ingestion reduced the 60 glucose response to both test meals by approximately 55%, but these reductions were significant only for the high glycemic load meal. So, yeah, combining even things like fiber, protein, nuts, and seeds has actually also been shown to lower the postprandial glucose response. So vinegar is usually added to, like, salad dressing and vegetables and things like that, like the Mediterranean diet. They eat olive oil, they eat vinegar as well, they combine it in their vinegar supplementation, lowers glucose and insulin responses and increases satiety after a bread meal in healthy subjects. So it does specifically work the most effective in lowering the glucose response if the meal is high glycemic. It's gonna have a less of an effect if it's low glycemic. If you eat already low carb and keto, which, that meal isn't gonna raise your blood sugar even that high, then, you're gonna see less of an effect. It might improve some aspects of the digestion even by boosting stomach acid, for example, but, you're gonna see the biggest response or the biggest benefit of taking apple cider vinegar if you eat, like, a high glycemic carbohydrate meal. Nice cream, an apple pie, and a bit less. Some of the bioactive compounds that mediate the benefits of the lowering of blood sugar and the cholesterol lowering effects, etcetera, in the vinegar, they are acetic acid primarily. Then there's things like gallic acid, catechin, epicatechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, coumaric acid, and ferulic acid. And when it comes to, like, weight loss and body fat loss, then there are some studies in humans showing that, it might help, with that by reducing triglycerides, reducing the glucose response and, yeah, helping to burn some of the visceral fat specifically around the organs. Of course, you still need to be in a calorie deficit but vinegar, if it suppresses your appetite, it reduces your food intake, then it enables you to achieve and reach calorie deficit much more easily and you're not gonna overeat either. People who take vinegar with meals typically end up eating 200 to 275 fewer calories for the rest of the day. Vinegars also have antibacterial properties that help to eliminate various pathogens such as e coli and candida. This can prevent the development of microbial dysbiosis that can have a negative effect on your weight loss and glucose tolerance. So as you can see, vinegar specifically is the best for lowering triglycerides, cholesterol, as well as lowering blood sugar levels and the benefits of insulin sensitivity and, lowering glucose specifically after a meal comes if you eat, like, a higher carb meal. But most people also take vinegar on an empty stomach in the fasted state and there are benefits to doing that as well by activating AMPK which then helps to speed up fat oxidation and helps you to go into deeper autophagy and these other, you know, longevity pathways that get activated from activation of AMPK. So I think taking a little bit of apple cider vinegar in empty stomach in the morning is pretty good and you definitely wanna combine it with meals by adding to your salad dressing and, take it maybe with water if you're not having salad, for example. To get the required amount of acetic acid for blood sugar regulation, you need about one to two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar, which if you don't add to salad as dressing, you should dilute in about eight ounces of water. Acetic acid can be harmful to your throat and teeth when you consume it it alone, so that's why you need to dilute it with water. Apple cider vinegar is five to 6% acetic acid, but the other types of vinegar like distilled vinegar and white vinegar are generally much higher. So in conclusion, apple cider vinegar is great. It's very beneficial for managing blood sugar levels and especially combining it with a high carb meal. But do you like carbs?
