All the available tools that we can use from nature, from science, from technology, from all kinds of possible ways that we can enhance our self consciousness. It's kinda sad that most people don't ever truly get to understand how amazing their bodies are and what they're capable of. We can live in the desert. We can live in the Arctic. We can live in the rainforest. So that's been, I think, one of the biggest reasons to our success as a species so far. Physiologically, we've been actually domesticating ourselves. We are basically looking at diversity and how that supports resilience and your health. Just to be able to feel good, you need to pay attention to several things at once. Eating better, sleeping better, moving constantly. Stressors and environmental disasters, they're not gonna go away. They're gonna keep happening, and we can't really avoid them. The only thing we can do is to keep ourselves more resilient, to keep ourselves more adaptable, and to prepare for those things in advance.
