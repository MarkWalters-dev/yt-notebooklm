Hey. Welcome back to the channel. My name is Sim Lund and today we talk about how I've been eating one meal a day for the last six years. Obviously, it's not been like a hundred percent one meal a day all the time. I've had, you know, days where I eat two meals. But, yeah, really I haven't eaten like three meals for the last maybe six years for sure. Even longer than like for the last eight years, I haven't eaten three meals a day. So, yeah. In this video, I'll do like an update because I've already made like an anniversary video about my one meal a day journey when I did it for four years, five years, and now six years. So, yeah, if you haven't checked those ones out, you can check that one as well. But, yeah, it's gonna be very similar. We'll just, you know, talk about how I do it and, yeah, what's been my progress.

That's what's my body composition been like. This on the left is me in the military when I was 19 years old, and, this is where I've been already been working out for maybe like maybe two or two years, three years something like that and, yeah, obviously the military is completely different from the gym or the training you do is completely different from like regular gym and bodybuilding type of things. You do a lot of cardio, you don't really, you know you do like, you know, if you're unfit you're gonna get fit, but if you're like a bodybuilder you're not necessarily gonna get more jacked or bigger. You may tend to shrink up a little bit because of doing a lot of cardio and not eating that much maybe. But yeah, like when I was in the military this was my physique, about sixty eight kilograms or something like that, and this was also like the end of the military. After that, this on the on the right is my last year's progress pick when I was 26 years old when I've been doing one meal a day for five years and I weighed about eighty four kilograms at that time. On the day left, this is where in the military, I wasn't doing like the I wasn't doing one meal a day. In the military, obviously, you can do that. I was doing more like, yeah, two meals or three meals something like that between those time frames. This was when I did switch to one meal a day. I was like 21 years old and I was in college at that time a bit heavier than in the military. A bit, you know, I had gained a little bit of my body weight but at that point I wasn't necessarily trying to build muscle either. I was, you know I've been always interested in calisthenics and bodyweight exercises like muscle ups and those kind of things. So I didn't never really want to like build mass in that sense. I never wanted to do that because it's obviously harder to train for muscle ups and those kind of things, if you're like super heavy weight. And I never really wanted to, you know, like gain a lot of weight. Maybe in on the left pick, when I'm 31 years old, I was maybe like, I don't know, maybe seventy one, seventy yeah, seventy one kilograms, something like that. And, on the right here is when I was 27 years old. It was a autumn twenty seven. So like a few months ago, maybe almost like six months ago actually. But I was 27 years old at that point. On the left, I had been already doing two meals a day. I was doing the sixteen minute method, and then I switched over into more like a one meal a day type of scenario. In this point, I wasn't doing again like a hundred percent one meal. I did have like some bulletproof coffee or something like that. I did have calories during the daytime as my first quote unquote meal, but then I had like the rest of the calories at dinner, where I would consume mostly like, yeah, the other protein and other micronutrients. This is like throughout this period what I've gone through in terms of my progress, on the left is where I was about maybe 22, 23 years old. On the right 24, 25 years old or something like that. And this was also when I was doing calisthenics. Most yeah. Like a 100% calisthenics. Throughout my time since the military actually, since this I was doing all only calisthenics. Calisthenics on the left, calisthenics only, calisthenics on the left. And then I started to implement more resistance training and gym workouts with barbells, the main compound lifts. And I think that that was a big change in terms of the, results I was getting because of yeah. The progressive overload is completely different when you're doing weight lifting, with, you know, barbells and dumbbells and that that kind of thing compared to progressive overload in calisthenics when you don't necessarily want to, you know, build muscle mass. But what I did realize was that, building muscle with one minute a day is very difficult. It's very slow, you know. There's different I'm not like super heavy like and I'm not like huge. If you were to see me in person, yeah, you would see that I work out, that I'm fit, and I'm, yeah, like much more muscular than the average person, but I'm not like, you know, a bodybuilder. You wouldn't like recognize me from the crowd that, okay, that guy lifts with my shirt like clothes on. Like if I take my shirt off maybe then you would recognize, but yeah, like, you know, I'm not massive by any means. I weigh only like, yeah, eighty three kilograms right now or something like that. And yeah, that's that's the reason for that is that, you know, the one meal a day isn't suitable for muscle mass. You're not gonna get super huge eating one meal a day. And that's why like, you know, for that, obviously three meals a day and even six meals a day day is obviously more superior. Although the research suggests that the natural athletes don't need to consume any more than four meals a day. You're not gonna see any additional benefits after that. But regardless, yeah, more more meals than one is good for muscle hypertrophy and that was a problem that I was also experiencing throughout my journey. Like there were periods where I ate strictly only one meal a day with no additional calories during daytime and that was yeah, where I didn't see like any progress in terms of muscle hypertrophy and even strength was like very slow to develop at that point and then I switched it up. I developed my own protocol which I call a targeted intermittent fasting and it's a form of basically one meal a day where you have you have basically this fast window, you fast the majority of the day. You still eat one meal a day with the majority of the calories there. I usually have, like, you know, one big main course and some some other smaller meals in the next to that. But during daytime, I do have, like, a protein shake during the, fasted window usually inter workout, or immediately before the workout. And the main idea is that because you're, you know, fasted, you're not gonna have, like, any, like, amino acids in your bloodstream, that does make it harder to build muscle and imposes additional muscle catabolism in your system. If you have the protein shake or some amino acids, in the fasted window, then that's just gonna reduce the muscle catabolism and still enables you to, like, progress in muscle hypertrophy and give you some muscles like these amino acids to repair and adapt to the training that you're doing. And this, I think, you know, is the best way to do one minute a day if you want to or it's the only way to do one minute a day if you want to build muscle. Like, yeah, just doing one meal a day without this thing, I don't think that you're gonna at least like if you're advanced. Maybe you're like a beginner or if you're overweight, you can still do it. But if you're advanced or even like intermediate, even then you're not gonna see any gains by eating just one meal a day. You need this additional surge of amino acids and protein shake. Something like something analogous even like a small meal whatever it is to facilitate the the muscle growth that you're trying to achieve. And yeah, what my schedule looks like is sometimes I may have like amino acids as well in the morning, which some people would argue that it breaks breaks fast, but there's actually evidence to suggest that essential amino acids may actually induce autophagy. So yeah, I don't. They're zero calories. I don't think that they actually raise like insulin. They do maybe activate some muscle anabolism, but in the absence of actual protein, the essential amino acids aren't going to turn on emptor either. They're only going to suppress muscle catabolism and prevent you from losing muscle mass, which is, you know, quite critical if you're only eating one meal a day. But then regardless, I'll still have, like, coffee that actually also stimulates the allergy. Then I have a protein shake during the workout. I'll wait a little bit as after the workout as well, and then I'll eat the rest of my calories. My daily calorie intake isn't that high. It's been relatively the same throughout this entire six year period. Maybe like a few years ago, I did eat a little bit less calories. Now I do eat more calories and that also, like, helps with muscle growth and recovery because I'm like I think I'm just, you know, burning more calories by being in a gym and that does, you know, I think that it, yeah, like makes me burn burn more calories, compared to just doing calisthenics, where the intensity is maybe a bit, lighter. And my total calorie intake is around, like, at least 2,000 up until 2,500. Some something mixed between there. On the rest days, I mean, like, 2,000 calories. And if I'm having a good, really good workout and I'm trying to build muscle mass or something, then I eat 2,500 calories. If I'm trying to cut down on body weight, I may, on some days, actually eat 1,800 calories, but, yeah, something, between that window is my calorie intake. And the foods I eat, I have many videos about that as well. I eat, you know, whole foods, carbs, protein. Right now, I'm actually eating more carbs. Like, my diet is significantly higher in carbs, than it is in fats. And I'm not really eating any, like added fats. The only fats I get are from whole foods. Mostly some protein sources that have fats on them. But, yeah, like higher carb intake that also helps with the gym workouts, helps helps with actually I I just think that higher carb intake is better for muscle growth as well because of the glycogen resynthesis. You hold more water in the muscles, so you look bigger because you have more water in the muscles and the more glycogen there as well. So, yeah, higher carb, higher protein, and lower fat is my diet actually right now. Time to carb a load. I also have my book, Metabolic Pathology, that talks about this entire structure about one meal a day and targeted interval of fasting, my entire theory and practice about it, my, like, similar meal plan that I follow myself with carb cycling and, you know, when you eat carbs, when you eat protein, when do you, structure the fasting window, that you can learn from my metabolic catology meal plan that is four weeks. It includes, a meal plan with all the calories, all the foods listed out, as well as the workout, structure for progressive overload in resistance training for developing muscle mass strength and also combining it with the anti aging benefits of time machine eating, calorie restriction, and, intermittent fasting.
