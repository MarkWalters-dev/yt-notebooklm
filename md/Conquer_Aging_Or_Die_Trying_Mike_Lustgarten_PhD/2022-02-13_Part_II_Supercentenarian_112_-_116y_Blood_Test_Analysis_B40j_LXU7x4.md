# 2022-02-13 Part II Supercentenarian 112 - 116y Blood Test Analysis

## Executive Summary

*   **Uric Acid:** Jarrahiman's average uric acid levels were close to the optimal range associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Total Protein & Globulin:** While total protein appeared youthful, the calculated globulin (gamma gap) was elevated, indicating a phenotype associated with shorter life expectancy.
*   **Liver Function Markers:** GOT (AST), gamma GTP (GGT), and cholinesterase levels were suboptimal and associated with increased all-cause mortality risk, suggesting potentially poor liver health. GPT (ALT) levels also indicated increased risk.
*   **Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Platelets, and Total Cholesterol:** These biomarkers were suboptimal and associated with increased all-cause mortality risk, indicating aged and unhealthy levels.
*   **Complex Biomarker Interactions:** Low total cholesterol, when combined with low albumin, indicated a higher risk of all-cause mortality, not necessarily a sign of youth.

## Biomarker Analysis

### Uric Acid

*   **Optimal Range for All-Cause Mortality:** 303 micromolar (5.09 mg/dL).
*   **Jarrahiman's Average Uric Acid:** 263.5 micromolar (4.43 mg/dL).
*   **Conclusion:** Jarrahiman's uric acid data was close to optimal, suggesting a low all-cause mortality risk associated with this biomarker.
*   **Note:** Suboptimal kidney function (indicated by elevated cystatin C and blood urea nitrogen) was noted in Part I, but uric acid levels were not correspondingly elevated. This may be due to low dietary precursor intake.

### Total Protein

*   **Age-Related Decline:** Total protein levels decline with age.
    *   20-year-olds: ~7.4 g/dL
    *   90+ year-olds: < 6.6 g/dL
*   **Jarrahiman's Average Total Protein:** 7.07 g/dL.
*   **Apparent Age:** Based on total protein, his levels resembled those of a ~60-year-old.
*   **Further Analysis (Total Protein = Albumin + Globulin):**
    *   Jarrahiman had aged and unhealthy albumin levels (from Part I).
    *   **Globulin (Gamma Gap) Calculation:**
        *   Test 1: 3.2 g/dL
        *   Test 2: 4.0 g/dL
        *   Test 3: 4.0 g/dL
    *   **Globulin and Survival (Average Age 94):**
        *   Gamma gap < 3.2 g/dL: Median survival of ~44 months.
        *   Gamma gap > 3.2 g/dL: Significantly shorter life expectancy.
    *   **Jarrahiman's Average Globulin (Gamma Gap):** 3.73 g/dL.
*   **Conclusion:** While total protein appeared youthful, the elevated globulin (gamma gap) indicated a phenotype associated with significantly shorter life expectancy. Low albumin and relatively high globulin reflect an unhealthy profile.

### Liver Function Markers

#### GOT (AST - Aspartate Aminotransferase)

*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:**
    *   Lowest risk: AST 21-23 (referent median 20).
    *   Jarrahiman's Average GOT: 29.
    *   **Conclusion:** Jarrahiman's GOT levels placed him in quartile 4 (median 27), indicating a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk. His GOT data was not good.

#### GPT (ALT - Alanine Aminotransferase)

*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:**
    *   Reference group (median 15) generally has lowest risk.
    *   However, ALT values of 18-22 (quartiles 2 and 3) showed reduced all-cause mortality risk compared to the reference.
    *   Jarrahiman's Average GPT: 14.7.
    *   **Conclusion:** Jarrahiman's GPT levels were in the reference group, but this group showed an increased all-cause mortality risk compared to slightly higher ALT values. His GPT levels were not optimal.

#### GOT/GPT Ratio (AST/ALT Ratio)

*   **Jarrahiman's Average AST/ALT Ratio:** 1.9 to 2.1.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:**
    *   Low AST/ALT ratio (1.02): Lower all-cause mortality risk.
    *   High AST/ALT ratio (1.83): Significantly increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Conclusion:** Jarrahiman's average AST/ALT ratio of 2.0 placed him in the high ratio group, indicating a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk. This data was not good.

#### Gamma GTP (GGT - Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase)

*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** Lower GGT is better.
    *   Lowest risk: Median GGT of 12.
    *   Risk increases significantly as GGT increases.
    *   Jarrahiman's Average Gamma GTP: 41.
*   **Conclusion:** Jarrahiman's average GGT level (41) fell between quartile 3 (median 32) and quartile 4 (median 58), both of which are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk. His GGT data was not good.

#### Cholinesterase

*   **Age-Related Decline:** Cholinesterase declines with age.
    *   Jarrahiman's Average Cholinesterase: ~199 IU/L, consistent with approximately 110-year-old data.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** Higher cholinesterase is associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Conclusion:** Jarrahiman had aged, not youthful levels of cholinesterase, placing him at an increased all-cause mortality risk.

**Overall Liver Function:** Collectively, these four markers indicated suboptimal and potentially poor liver health and function.

### Hemoglobin

*   **Jarrahiman's Average Hemoglobin:** 12.1 g/dL.
*   **Reference for Lowest Risk (Men):** Approximately 14-14.9 g/dL.
*   **Conclusion:** Jarrahiman's hemoglobin levels were associated with a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk. His levels were not good.

### Hematocrit

*   **Jarrahiman's Average Hematocrit:** 37.7%.
*   **Optimal for Lowest All-Cause Mortality:** 43.5%.
*   **Conclusion:** Jarrahiman's hematocrit was suboptimal and moving in the wrong direction compared to the optimal range.

### Platelets

*   **Age-Related Decline in Men:** Platelet counts decline with age, approaching <210 x 10^3/µL around 100 years old.
*   **Jarrahiman's Average Platelets:** 173,700 platelets/µL (approximately 17.3 x 10^3/µL in the study's units).
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:**
    *   Reference: 200-300 x 10^3/µL.
    *   100-200 x 10^3/µL (Jarrahiman's range): Significantly increased all-cause mortality risk (25% increase in crude model).
*   **Conclusion:** Jarrahiman's platelets were aged, not youthful, and unhealthy, associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.

### Total Cholesterol

*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk (Ages 75-99):**
    *   Lowest risk: Total cholesterol 200-229 mg/dL.
    *   Jarrahiman's Average Total Cholesterol: 153 mg/dL.
*   **Conclusion:** Jarrahiman's total cholesterol was associated with a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk.

*   **Total Cholesterol and Aging:**
    *   Increases until ~50 years old (e.g., 160 to 200 mg/dL in men).
    *   Declines after age 50.
*   **Interpretation:** Jarrahiman's low total cholesterol (153 mg/dL) may have been a decline from higher youthful levels. However, low total cholesterol itself can be indicative of health issues.

*   **Total Cholesterol < 160 mg/dL and Other Biomarkers:**
    *   **Reference (Low Total Cholesterol, Low Albumin, Low HDL):** Baseline risk.
    *   **Low Total Cholesterol, Low Albumin, High HDL:** Similar risk to reference.
    *   **Low Total Cholesterol, High Albumin, Low HDL:** ~32% reduced all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Low Total Cholesterol, High Albumin, High HDL:** ~62% reduced all-cause mortality risk.

*   **Jarrahiman's Data in Context (Low Total Cholesterol Group):**
    *   **Total Cholesterol:** 153 mg/dL (low).
    *   **Albumin:** 3.3 g/dL (low).
    *   **HDL:** (Presumed high from Part I analysis, though not explicitly stated here in comparison).
*   **Conclusion:** Jarrahiman's relatively low total cholesterol, combined with low albumin, indicated a higher risk for all-cause mortality, rather than being indicative of youth.

## Summary of Findings (Part II)

*   **Potentially Good Biomarker:** Uric acid was close to optimal.
*   **Biomarkers Going in the Wrong Direction:** Most other analyzed biomarkers (total protein/globulin, GOT, GPT, GGT, cholinesterase, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, total cholesterol) were suboptimal or unhealthy, and associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Importance of Other Biomarkers:** When considering the "good" biomarkers from Part I (glucose, HbA1c, HDL, triglycerides, white blood cells, CRP), their favorable status highlights their potential role in longevity, especially given the multitude of "not good" biomarkers related to kidney, liver, red blood cells, and cardiovascular health.
