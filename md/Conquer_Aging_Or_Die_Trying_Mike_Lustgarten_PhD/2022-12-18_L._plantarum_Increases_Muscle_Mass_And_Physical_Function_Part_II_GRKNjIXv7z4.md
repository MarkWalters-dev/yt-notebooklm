# 2022-12-18 L. plantarum Increases Muscle Mass And Physical Function Part II

## Executive Summary

*   L. plantarum, isolated from Taiwanese pickled cabbage, significantly improved muscle strength in both young and aged mice, although it did not impact muscle mass.
*   In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving healthy young adults, high-dose L. plantarum supplementation increased muscle mass and aerobic exercise capacity, and reduced body fat percentage, independent of diet or body weight changes.
*   Another RCT in frail older adults demonstrated that high-dose L. plantarum led to small but significant increases in muscle mass and improved various physical functions, including lower body strength, endurance, and mobility.
*   Dose-dependent effects were observed, with different outcomes regarding body fat changes between young and older adult cohorts.

## Introduction

This study investigates whether different strains of L. plantarum can improve muscle mass and physical function. Building on previous research where L. plantarum isolated from an Olympic weightlifter increased muscle mass and physical function in young mice, this video explores a strain derived from Taiwanese pickled cabbage. The research addresses its impact on young and aged mice, as well as its effects in human randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

## Mouse Data

**Study Methodology:**
L. plantarum was isolated from Taiwanese pickled cabbage and transplanted into both young and aged mice. This was an eight-week study.

**Muscle Strength (Grip Strength):**
Aged mice at baseline exhibited worse grip strength compared to young mice, consistent with age-related decline in muscle strength. Following L. plantarum transplantation, grip strength improved in both young and aged mice at both the four and eight-week time points.

**Muscle Mass (Relative Muscle Weight):**
L. plantarum supplementation did not affect relative muscle weight (muscle mass divided by body weight) in either young or aged mice.

**Summary of Mouse Findings:**
L. plantarum supplementation in mice resulted in improved muscle strength, but not an increase in muscle mass, in both young and aged groups.

## Human Evidence: Healthy Young Adults

**Study Methodology (RCT 1):**
*   **Participants:** Healthy men and women, with nine subjects per group (18 total per dose arm).
*   **Supplementation Doses:**
    *   Low Dose: 3 x 10^10 colony forming units (CFUs) of L. plantarum per day.
    *   High Dose: 9 x 10^10 CFUs of L. plantarum per day.
    *   *(Note: These doses were higher than those used in mouse studies.)*
*   **Participant Characteristics:**
    *   Age: Young adults, average 21-23 years old.
    *   BMI: Relatively lean (BMI < 25 kg/m^2) across all groups, except for a slightly higher average in the high-dose L. plantarum group.
    *   Cardiovascular Fitness: Relatively fit, indicated by average VO2 max values (approaching 50 for men, around 45 for women).
*   **Study Duration:** Six weeks of supplementation.

**Muscle Mass and Body Composition:**
*   **Muscle Mass (Bioelectric Impedance Analysis - BIA):** Muscle weight significantly increased only for the highest dose of L. plantarum.
*   **Body Fat Percentage:** A reduction in body fat percentage was observed with the highest dose of L. plantarum supplementation.
*   **Confounding Factors:** Calorie, protein, fat, and carbohydrate intake did not differ from baseline in any group. Body weight also remained unchanged compared to baseline for all groups. This indicates a potential direct role for L. plantarum in increasing muscle mass and decreasing body fat percentage.

**Physical Function:**
*   **Aerobic Exercise Capacity (Treadmill Exhaustion Time):** Treadmill exhaustion time was significantly longer for both the low and high dose L. plantarum supplemented groups compared to the placebo group.

**Summary for Healthy Young Adults:**
L. plantarum supplementation in young adults led to an increase in muscle mass and aerobic exercise capacity, along with a reduction in body fat percentage.

## Human Evidence: Frail Older Adults

**Study Methodology (RCT 2):**
*   **Participants:** Frail older adults.
*   **Supplementation Doses:**
    *   Low Dose: 2 x 10^10 CFUs of L. plantarum per day.
    *   High Dose: 6 x 10^10 CFUs of L. plantarum per day.
    *   *(Note: Both doses were lower than those used in the young adult study; low dose was 50% lower, high dose was 33% lower.)*
*   **Participant Characteristics:**
    *   Age: Average ages within the 75-81 year old range.
    *   Frailty Score: Average frailty score of approximately 3 on the Clinical Frailty Scale (1-4 range), indicating subjects were "managing well" (medical problems controlled but sedentary beyond routine walking).
*   **Study Duration:** Eighteen weeks of supplementation.

**Muscle Mass:**
*   **Absolute Muscle Mass:** The low dose of L. plantarum did not affect muscle mass. However, the high-dose group showed small but significant increases (approximately 1-3%) at 6, 12, and 18 weeks compared to baseline.
*   **Relative Muscle Weight Percentage:** The low dose L. plantarum group showed no significant change. The high-dose group showed a significant increase of approximately 3% only at 18 weeks. Changes at 6 and 12 weeks were not significant when accounting for body weight.
*   **Body Fat Percentage:** Unlike the study in young adults, body fat percentage was not significantly different for any L. plantarum supplemented group (low or high dose) in older adults.

**Physical Function:**

*   **Grip Strength:**
    *   Right Hand: No significant increase observed in either L. plantarum group.
    *   Left Hand: The low-dose group showed no significant improvement. The high-dose group showed a 13% significant increase at 18 weeks.
*   **Lower Body Strength/Endurance (30-Second Chair Stand Test):** The number of chair stands at 12 and 18 weeks was significantly increased for both low and high-dose L. plantarum groups.
*   **Mobility, Balance, Gait (3-Meter Timed Up and Go - 3m TUG):**
    *   Placebo group's performance significantly worsened over the study duration.
    *   Low-dose group showed no effect.
    *   High-dose group showed a significant improvement (faster time) at 18 weeks.
*   **Mobility (10-Meter Walk Test):**
    *   Placebo group's performance worsened over the study duration.
    *   Low-dose L. plantarum group achieved a faster 10-meter walk time at the 18-week time point.
    *   The high-dose L. plantarum group did not show an improvement in this test.

**Summary for Frail Older Adults:**
L. plantarum supplementation, specifically at the high dose, resulted in small but significant improvements in muscle mass and various physical functions, including lower body strength, endurance, and mobility in frail older adults.

## Overall Conclusion

*   L. plantarum transplantation from an Olympic weightlifter improved muscle mass and physical function in young mice (from previous research).
*   L. plantarum isolated from fermented cabbage showed:
    *   Improved muscle strength, but not muscle mass, in both young and aged mice.
    *   In young adults, an increase in muscle mass and aerobic exercise capacity, and a reduction in body fat percentage.
    *   In older adults, small but significant improvements in muscle mass and various physical functions.
