# 2024-04-10 Higher HRV Lower RHR - What s Contributing To Improvements Since 2018

### Executive Summary

*   Since 2018, heart rate variability (HRV) has increased by 43% (from 47 ms to 68 ms), and resting heart rate (RHR) has decreased by 17% (from 51 bpm to 42 bpm).
*   High average daily heart rate (ADHR), an index of daily physical activity, is significantly positively correlated with next-day RHR and inversely correlated with next-day HRV, indicating that excessive activity without adequate recovery can worsen these metrics.
*   An optimized training schedule balances active days with sufficient recovery, allowing RHR and HRV to improve.
*   Body weight shows a significant positive correlation with RHR and a significant inverse correlation with HRV, meaning lower body weight is associated with more youthful cardiovascular fitness metrics.

## Cardiovascular Fitness Improvements (2018-2024)

From 2018 to 2024, the following improvements have been observed:
*   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** Increased by 43%, from an average of 47 milliseconds to 68 milliseconds.
*   **Resting Heart Rate (RHR):** Decreased by 17%, from approximately 51 beats per minute to 42 beats per minute.

## Impact of Physical Activity

Average Daily Heart Rate (ADHR) is used as an index of daily physical activity. Data from March 2020 through March 2024 (nearly 1500 days) reveals the following correlations:

### Average Daily Heart Rate and Resting Heart Rate

There is a significant positive correlation (r = 0.72, p < 0.05) between the previous day's ADHR and the next day's RHR. This suggests that higher levels of daily activity are significantly correlated with higher resting heart rates.

### Average Daily Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability

There is a significant inverse correlation between the previous day's ADHR and the next day's HRV. This indicates that higher levels of daily activity are significantly correlated with lower heart rate variability.

### Implications for Recovery

Insufficient recovery between workouts can lead to chronically lower HRV and chronically higher RHR. A relatively high HRV in conjunction with a low RHR is characteristic of youthful cardiovascular data. Therefore, balancing active and rest days is crucial for optimizing these two variables.

### Personal Activity Protocol Example

An example of a weekly training schedule designed to optimize HRV and RHR:
*   **Day 1 (Active Day):** ADHR of 58 beats per minute (bpm).
*   **Days 2-3 (Recovery Days):** Purposefully titrate activity lower (e.g., ADHR of 56 bpm and 52 bpm) to allow for RHR and HRV recovery.
*   **Day 4 (Active Day):** Another workout, ADHR of 57 bpm. Workouts consist of 90-minute full-body circuits including strength training, calisthenics, stretching, and mobility. Recovery for RHR and HRV from these workouts typically takes at least two days.
*   **Days 5-6 (Recovery Days):** Purposefully titrate activity lower for at least two days after the second active day (e.g., ADHR of 56 bpm and 54 bpm).

## Relationship with Body Weight

Body weight has also been tracked daily (fasted, after using the bathroom) since August 2018, alongside HRV and RHR.

### Body Weight and Resting Heart Rate

Analysis of daily RHR versus body weight data from August 2018 through March 2024 (approximately 2100 days) shows:
*   **Observation:** Periods of reduced body weight generally coincide with declines in RHR, while periods of body weight gain coincide with increases in RHR.
*   **Correlation:** There is a significant positive correlation (r = 0.7, p < 0.05) between RHR and body weight. This means that as body weight increases, RHR is significantly correlated with higher values.
*   **Outcome:** As body weight approaches 139 pounds, RHR has approached 40 beats per minute.

### Body Weight and Heart Rate Variability

Analysis of average monthly HRV over the same period (August 2018 through March 2024) shows:
*   **Observation:** During periods of body weight reduction, HRV generally increased, particularly over the most recent three years where consistent weight reduction correlated with consistent HRV increases. Conversely, periods of body weight increase correlated with decreased HRV.
*   **Correlation:** There is a significant inverse correlation between body weight and HRV. This indicates that as body weight increases, HRV is significantly correlated with lower values.
*   **Outcome:** As body weight has been reduced, HRV has approached relatively youthful values (68 milliseconds).

### Conclusion on Body Weight

Based on these data, RHR and HRV approach more youthful values as body weight decreases.
