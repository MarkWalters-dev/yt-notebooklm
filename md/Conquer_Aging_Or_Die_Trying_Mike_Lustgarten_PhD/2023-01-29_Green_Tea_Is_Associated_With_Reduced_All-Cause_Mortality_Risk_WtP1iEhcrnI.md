# 2023-01-29 Green Tea Is Associated With Reduced All-Cause Mortality Risk

**Executive Summary**

*   A study of 165,000 individuals found green tea consumption greater than 6 grams/day was associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk. For never smokers, the lowest all-cause mortality risk was observed with 7-11 grams of green tea per day.
*   A 2015 meta-analysis, including 201,000 people across five studies, indicated that consuming up to five cups of green tea per day was significantly associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk.
*   A comprehensive 2019 meta-analysis, incorporating eight cohort studies with over 313,000 individuals (aged 40-103), demonstrated that consuming more than one cup of green tea per day significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk in both men and women, compared to consuming less than one cup per day.
*   Most of the data on green tea and all-cause mortality risk comes from Japanese cohorts.

## Initial Population Study

A study including approximately 165,000 people investigated the association between daily green tea consumption (in grams) and all-cause mortality risk (hazard ratio).

*   Statistical significance was determined when the 95% confidence interval was entirely below a hazard ratio of one (indicating reduced risk).
*   For the whole population, green tea consumption greater than about six grams per day was associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk.
*   Focusing on never smokers, green tea consumption above zero grams per day was associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk. The lowest all-cause mortality risk was observed with consumption between seven and eleven grams of green tea per day.

## 2015 Meta-analysis Findings

A 2015 meta-analysis, encompassing five studies and approximately 201,000 people, examined all-cause mortality risk in relation to green tea consumption (in cups per day).

*   Compared with a hazard ratio of one, consuming up to about five cups of green tea per day was significantly associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk.

## 2019 Meta-analysis Findings

A 2019 meta-analysis investigated green tea consumption and its association with all-cause mortality risk. This analysis included eight cohort studies with more than 313,000 individuals, aged 40 to 103 years, making it the largest study of its kind to date.

*   Green tea consumption was categorized into four groups: less than one cup, one to two cups, three to four cups, and greater than five cups per day.
*   All-cause mortality risk (Hazard Ratio, HR) and its 95% confidence interval were reported. A statistically significant association was indicated when the confidence interval was entirely below one.
*   Data for men (145,000 individuals) and women (169,000 individuals) was analyzed separately.
*   Results from the fully adjusted multivariate model (Model 2) were considered.
*   Compared with individuals who drank less than one cup of green tea per day:
    *   Consuming one to two cups per day was associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk.
    *   Consuming three to four cups per day was associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk.
    *   Consuming greater than five cups per day was associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk.
*   This meta-analysis concluded that consuming greater than one cup of green tea per day is associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk in both men and women.
*   Most of the green tea all-cause mortality data originates from Japanese cohorts.
