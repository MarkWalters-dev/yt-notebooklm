# 2024-03-27 What s The Lowest Niacin Dose That Impacts NAD

**Executive Summary**
*   Previous findings indicated that 60 milligrams per day of nicotinic acid increased intracellular NAD levels.
*   An attempt to increase NAD with a lower dose combination (45 mg/day nicotinic acid for one week, alongside 51 mg/day Trigonelline for one week) did not elevate NAD levels (26.3 micromolar) beyond the established baseline range (18.5-26.6 micromolar).
*   Based on these results, 60 milligrams per day of nicotinic acid remains the lowest dose identified so far to impact NAD levels for this individual.
*   A subsequent experiment is planned to investigate the effect of a significantly higher Trigonelline intake (approximately 150 mg/day from red clover sprouts) combined with a very low dose of nicotinic acid (only on exercise days).

## Current NAD Status and Nicotinic Acid / Trigonelline Dosing

To assess the lowest effective dose of nicotinic acid, blood was collected on March 4 for intracellular NAD analysis by GINFINITY.

**Nicotinic Acid Intake Prior to Testing:**
*   From the last test until the day before the March 4 test: Average daily nicotinic acid intake was 27 milligrams.
*   Two weeks before testing: Average daily nicotinic acid intake was 38 milligrams.
*   One week before testing: Average daily nicotinic acid intake was 45 milligrams.

**Trigonelline Intake Prior to Testing:**
*   For one week before testing, average Trigonelline intake was 51 milligrams per day, the highest to date. This was an intentional increase aiming to raise NAD levels.

## Experimental Results and Conclusion

The intracellular NAD level for the March 4 test was 26.3 micromolar. This level was not higher than the NAD levels observed without NAD precursors, which, based on seven previous tests, fall within the 18.5 to 26.6 micromolar range. In contrast, with effective NAD precursors, NAD levels have consistently been higher than 26.6 micromolar in seven tests. An exception was 300 milligrams per day of NMN, which resulted in 25.3 micromolar and did not increase NAD.

Therefore, the combination of 45 milligrams per day of nicotinic acid and 51 milligrams per day of Trigonelline did not increase NAD levels. The lowest dose of nicotinic acid found to increase NAD in this case remains 60 milligrams per day.

## Future Experiment Design

The next experiment aims to explore the impact of a significantly increased Trigonelline intake in combination with a very low dose of nicotinic acid.

**Background for Trigonelline Increase:**
*   Half of the 51 milligrams per day of Trigonelline from the previous week's testing came from consuming about 100 grams of alfalfa sprouts daily, which is a moderate source of Trigonelline.
*   Red clover seeds contain approximately five times more Trigonelline than alfalfa sprouts. While the Trigonelline content in red clover seed sprouts was not found in PubMed, the seeds themselves suggest a higher potential.

**Planned Protocol for Next NAD Experiment:**
*   Consume an equivalent amount (approximately 100 grams per day) of red clover sprouts.
*   This is projected to increase daily Trigonelline intake from about 50 mg to approximately 150 mg:
    *   125 mg from red clover sprouts (assuming 100g clover sprouts have 5x the Trigonelline of 100g alfalfa sprouts which provided 25mg).
    *   25 mg from background dietary sources (e.g., chickpeas).
*   Incorporate a very low dose of nicotinic acid, used only on exercise days, to potentially benefit heart rate variability and resting heart rate recovery.
*   Blood testing is planned within four days to measure the impact of this combination on NAD levels.
