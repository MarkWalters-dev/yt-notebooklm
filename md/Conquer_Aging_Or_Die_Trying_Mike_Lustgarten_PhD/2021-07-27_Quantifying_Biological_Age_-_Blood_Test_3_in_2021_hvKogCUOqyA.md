# 2021-07-27 Quantifying Biological Age - Blood Test 3 in 2021

## Executive Summary
*   The speaker's biological age, calculated using Morgan Levine's phenotypic age calculator, was 35.2 years, which is 13.2 years younger than their chronological age of 48.
*   Levine's phenotypic age test shows a very strong correlation with chronological age (0.94 in NHANES III; 0.96 in NHANES IV), comparable to the best epigenetic clocks like the Horvath clock (0.94 composite correlation).
*   An increase of one year in biological age, as measured by Levine's test, corresponds to a 9% increase in all-cause mortality risk (Hazard Ratio of 1.09).
*   Cardiovascular metrics (Resting Heart Rate of 47.1 bpm and Heart Rate Variability of 52.7 ms) align with metrics typically seen in younger individuals and are associated with lower all-cause mortality risk.
*   The aging.ai biological age calculation (which excludes chronological age) predicted an age of 29 years for the speaker.

## Phenotypic Age Assessment: Levine's Test

Levine's phenotypic age calculator utilizes a panel of nine well-established biomarkers to assess biological age.

### Correlation with Chronological Age
The test shows a strong linear correlation with chronological age in large population studies:
*   NHANES III: Correlation coefficient of **0.94**.
*   NHANES IV: Correlation coefficient of **0.96**.

### Comparison to Epigenetic Clocks
When compared to the Horvath epigenetic clock (a multi-tissue composite measurement across 16 cell/organ types), which correlates with chronological age at 0.94, Levine's test is argued to be similarly robust in its correlation with chronological age.

### Association with Mortality Risk
Levine's biological age is associated with all-cause mortality risk:
*   For every one-year increase in biological age, all-cause mortality risk increases by **9%** (Hazard Ratio = 1.09).
*   This association holds across age groups, showing increases of 13% (young), 10% (middle-aged), and 8% (older) risk per year of biological age.
*   Older biological age is associated with increased mortality risk from heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease, diabetes-related mortality, influenza/pneumonia, and kidney-related mortality (including nephritis/nephrosis).

## Alternative Biological Age Assessment: Aging.ai

The aging.ai test is another free, online blood-based biomarker panel that differs because it does not include chronological age in its model.

### Test Composition and Cost
*   **Biomarkers:** Includes 19 different blood-based biomarkers found on the standard chemistry panel and a Complete Blood Count (CBC).
*   **Cost Estimate (US):** ~$35 or less (as 8 of the 9 markers for Levine's test are covered, plus hs-CRP can be added for $40-$45 total).

### Correlation and Mortality Association
*   **Correlation with Chronological Age:** 0.8 for the 19-biomarker panel.
*   **Mortality Data:** Biological ages younger than chronological age are associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk.
    *   In a Canadian cohort, biological ages >5 years older than chronological age showed a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk (HR closer to 2).
    *   Conversely, biological ages $\ge$ 5 years younger than chronological age showed significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk.

### Speaker's Aging.ai Result
*   Predicted Age: **29 years** (nearly 20 years younger than chronological age).

## Contributing Factors to Lower Biological Age

The speaker analyzes factors contributing to their younger biological age (using Levine's and aging.ai tests).

### Supplementation
1.  **Levothyroxine:** $137.5 \mu g$ daily for hypothyroidism (taken for $\sim$20 years).
2.  **Methyl B12:** $1000 \mu g$ every other day for an 84-day period preceding the test.

### Body Composition and Fitness Stats (Averaged over 84 days)
*   **Average Body Weight:** 156.7 pounds.
*   **BMI:** 24.5 (within the normal range).
*   **Resting Heart Rate (RHR):** 47.1 beats per minute (bpm).
*   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** 52.7 milliseconds (ms).

### Cardiovascular Fitness Metrics Analysis

#### Resting Heart Rate (RHR)
*   **Age Trend (WHOOP Data, ages 20-50):** RHR increases with age, moving from $\sim$53 bpm (men) and $\sim$56 bpm (women) at age 20 to higher values at age 50.
*   **Mortality Association (Meta-analysis of 46 studies):** The lowest relative risk for all-cause mortality was found at an RHR of 45 bpm. Risk significantly increases above 45 bpm.
*   **Conclusion:** The speaker's RHR of 47.1 bpm is youthful compared to age-matched peers and is near the lowest mortality risk threshold. *Caveat:* RHR begins to decrease again after age 50 (as shown by Fitbit data up to age 85).

#### Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
*   **Definition:** HRV is the millisecond variation in time between successive heartbeats.
    *   *Example:* For successive inter-beat times of 859 ms, 793 ms, and 726 ms, the resulting HRV is 67 ms.
*   **Age Trend (WHOOP Data, ages 20-65):** Higher HRV is found in youth, declining during aging (e.g., dropping from $\sim$80 ms at age 20 to $\sim$35-40 ms at age 65).
*   **Speaker's HRV:** 52.7 ms.
    *   This places the speaker at the high end of the range for their age group (48) or potentially at the low end of the range for someone in their early twenties.
*   **Conclusion:** The combination of relatively low RHR and high HRV (compared to the median for age) suggests cardiovascular fitness is contributing to a younger biological age, indicating a state closer to youthfulness rather than poor fitness sometimes indicated by low RHR combined with low HRV.
