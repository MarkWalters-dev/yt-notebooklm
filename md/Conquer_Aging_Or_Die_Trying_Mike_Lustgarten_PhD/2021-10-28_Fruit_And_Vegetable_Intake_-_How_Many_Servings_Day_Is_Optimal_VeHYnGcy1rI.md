# 2021-10-28 Fruit And Vegetable Intake - How Many Servings Day Is Optimal

## Executive Summary

*   A meta-analysis of 1.9 million subjects found that consuming less than two servings of fruits and vegetables daily is associated with a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality.
*   All-cause mortality risk is significantly reduced with fruit and vegetable intake up to 10 servings per day, with the lowest risk observed in this range.
*   Optimal fruit intake appears to be around three servings per day for the lowest all-cause mortality risk, although intakes up to six servings per day still show reduced risk.
*   Optimal vegetable intake appears to be around 1.8 servings per day and above, with significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk observed up to eight servings per day.
*   Individual data suggests that combined fruit and vegetable intake, and potentially higher intakes than indicated by the meta-analysis, may have a positive net effect on key blood biomarkers, though further investigation into specific fruit and vegetable contributions is ongoing.

## Human Evidence: Meta-Analysis of Fruit and Vegetable Intake

A meta-analysis of 26 studies involving 1,900,000 subjects examined the association between fruit and vegetable intake and all-cause mortality risk. One serving was defined as 80 grams.

*   **Total Fruit and Vegetable Intake:**
    *   **< 2 servings/day:** Associated with a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **2 - 10 servings/day:** All-cause mortality risk is significantly reduced as intake increases within this range. The lowest all-cause mortality risk is observed up to 10 servings per day.

*   **Fruit Intake:**
    *   **< 0.5 servings/day (40 grams):** Associated with a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Up to 3 servings/day:** Associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Up to 6 servings/day:** Still significantly associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk, though risk may begin to increase at higher intakes.

*   **Vegetable Intake:**
    *   **< 1.8 servings/day:** Associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **≥ 1.8 servings/day:** Significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk observed up to eight servings per day.

Based on this meta-analysis, an intake of approximately 10 servings of fruits and vegetables per day may be optimal for overall health.

## Individual Data: High Fruit and Vegetable Intake and Biomarker Correlation

Individual data from a three-year period (July 2018 - September 2021) tracked average daily fruit and vegetable intake alongside blood test results. The average daily intake over this period was approximately 2,800 grams, equating to 35 servings per day, with a range from 27 to 40 servings per day.

*   **Average Daily Intake:**
    *   **Total Fruits and Vegetables:** 35 servings/day
    *   **Fruit:** 15 servings/day (range: 10-19 servings/day)
    *   **Vegetables:** 20 servings/day (range: 14-28 servings/day)

This individual intake is higher than the optimal ranges suggested by the meta-analysis for both combined fruits/vegetables, fruit alone, and vegetables alone.

### Correlation of Combined Fruit and Vegetable Intake with Biomarkers

The correlation between average daily fruit and vegetable intake (35 servings/day) and 22 key blood biomarkers was assessed.

*   **Biomarkers Showing Positive Correlation (Improved Health Markers):**
    *   Lower Glucose
    *   Lower Neutrophils
    *   Lower Creatinine
    *   Higher Lymphocyte Percentage

*   **Biomarkers Showing Negative Correlation (Worsened Health Markers):**
    *   Higher ALT (liver enzyme)
    *   Lower Red Blood Cells

*   **Net Correlative Effect:** +2 (4 biomarkers in the right direction, 2 in the wrong direction).
*   **Adjusted Net Effect (accounting for potential false positives):** Potentially +1 to +3.

This positive net score suggests that a higher intake of fruits and vegetables, potentially within the range of 35 to 40 servings per day, may be beneficial for systemic health.

### Correlation of Fruit Intake with Biomarkers

The correlation between average daily fruit intake (15 servings/day) and the same key blood biomarkers was assessed.

*   **Biomarkers Showing Positive Correlation:**
    *   Lower Glucose
    *   Lower Neutrophils
    *   Higher Lymphocyte Percentage

*   **Biomarkers Showing Negative Correlation:**
    *   Lower Platelets
    *   Lower Red Blood Cells

*   **Net Correlative Effect:** +1 (3 biomarkers in the right direction, 2 in the wrong direction).
*   **Adjusted Net Effect:** Potentially 0 to +2.

This suggests that an intake of approximately 15 to 17 servings of fruit per day might be optimal based on these data.

### Correlation of Vegetable Intake with Biomarkers

The correlation between average daily vegetable intake (20 servings/day) and the same key blood biomarkers was assessed.

*   **Biomarkers Showing Positive Correlation:**
    *   Lower LDL (low-density lipoprotein)

*   **Biomarkers Showing Negative Correlation:**
    *   Higher VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein)

*   **Net Correlative Effect:** 0 (1 biomarker in the right direction, 1 in the wrong direction).
*   **Adjusted Net Effect:** Potentially -1 to +1.

This suggests that an intake of approximately 19 to 21 servings of vegetables per day may have a net neutral effect on these biomarkers.
