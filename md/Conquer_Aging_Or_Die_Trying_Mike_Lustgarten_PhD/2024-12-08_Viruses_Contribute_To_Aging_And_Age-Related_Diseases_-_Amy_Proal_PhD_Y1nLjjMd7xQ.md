# 2024-12-08 Viruses Contribute To Aging And Age-Related Diseases - Amy Proal PhD

## Executive Summary

*   Persistent viral infections (the human virome) contribute significantly to aging processes by driving mitochondrial dysfunction, chronic inflammation (inflammaging), and distorting longevity-associated gene signaling.
*   Viruses, bacteria, and fungi can directly induce amyloid plaque formation in the brain, suggesting these plaques may function as antimicrobial peptides rather than just pathological aggregates in Alzheimer's disease.
*   Low-dose rapamycin shows promise in improving immune control over persistent viruses by enhancing interferon-induced antiviral gene expression, boosting vaccine responses, and reducing T-cell exhaustion, potentially offering longevity benefits.
*   SARS-CoV-2 can persist in tissues (e.g., gut), contributing to long COVID symptoms and driving fibrin microclot formation, which can be addressed by anti-fibrinolytic enzymes like lumbrokinase or nattokinase.
*   Accurate diagnosis and understanding of persistent pathogens require tissue sampling (e.g., gut biopsies) rather than relying solely on blood tests, as pathogens often reside in tissue reservoirs, evading systemic immune detection.

Viruses affect many processes that directly impact human aging. These effects can be categorized into three main areas: mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and cognitive decline. While the focus is on viruses, other pathogens like bacteria, fungi, and parasites, especially those that can persist in humans, can drive similar aging processes.

## The Human Virome

Humans accumulate viruses throughout their lives that persist chronically. These viruses collectively form the human virome. Viruses can be inherited from mothers in the womb and acquired through environmental exposures (e.g., drinking water, social interaction). Common members of the human virome include herpesviruses (e.g., Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus), papillomaviruses, and increasingly, RNA viruses like certain coronaviruses and even SARS-CoV-2.

A study in Japan analyzed tissue samples (brain, pituitary, thyroid, heart, breast, lung) from healthy individuals who died suddenly. Using advanced technologies for both DNA and RNA viruses, the study identified dozens of different viruses, including herpesviruses (Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus) and coronaviruses (e.g., hCoV-229E), confirming a wide range of chronic viral passengers in human tissues.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the cause of mononucleosis, persists in the body for life after initial infection. Under conditions of a robust immune system, viruses like EBV are kept in a latent or dormant state, unable to significantly interfere with human biology. However, if the immune system is disturbed by factors such as other infections, chemical exposures, pollutants, or stress, these viruses can reactivate, leading to various disease processes.

## Viruses and Mitochondrial Dysfunction

Viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens, meaning they require host cell substrates, often supplied by mitochondria, for their replication. Chronic viral infections, especially when active, can detrimentally impact mitochondrial function by hijacking these substrates.

**Mechanism of Mitochondrial Hijacking:**
Viruses interfere with the Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle within mitochondria. Substrates normally produced for host energy metabolism and cellular pathways are instead diverted by viral proteins to support viral replication. This direct manipulation of mitochondrial metabolism by persistent pathogens over time can contribute to aging processes.

## Viruses and Inflammation (Inflammaging)

Aging is often associated with unproductive, over-exuberant inflammation, known as "inflammaging," which is a key contributor to age-related diseases and impacts longevity. Inflammatory molecules called cytokines, such as IL-11, contribute to perpetuating this chronic inflammation. Inhibiting IL-11 signaling has been shown to extend mammalian lifespan and healthspan.

Viruses and other pathogens are significant drivers of cytokine activation, including IL-11. A study demonstrated that respiratory viruses could stimulate IL-11 activity both *in vivo* (animal models) and *in vitro* (lab). This indicates that even common viruses can be root causes of inflammatory processes.

## Viruses and Human Gene Signaling / Longevity Networks

Beyond driving inflammation, viruses can directly distort human signaling pathways crucial for longevity, such as those controlling cellular senescence (the ability of cells to replicate and remain healthy).

A network-based analysis identified dozens of viruses that encode proteins experimentally shown to interact with human proteins from pathways associated with aging, including senescence signaling. Herpesviruses and papillomaviruses were prominent among those viruses creating "age-distorter" proteins, exhibiting thousands of interactions with human gene networks. This suggests that the locus of aging should be expanded to include genetic entities like viruses that interact with human species.

Many viruses have evolved to create proteins similar in size and shape to human proteins, a phenomenon called molecular mimicry. For example, some Epstein-Barr virus proteins structurally resemble human proteins important for immune system regulation. This allows viral proteins to bind into and modulate human signaling pathways in the virus's favor, rather than the host's.

## Viruses and Cognitive Decline (Alzheimer's Disease)

Research provides clear evidence linking viruses to cognitive decline, including dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

**Alzheimer's Plaque as an Antimicrobial Peptide:**
*   **Methodology:** Neuron-in-a-dish models (mini-brains) were infected with herpesviruses.
*   **Findings:** The amyloid plaque, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, formed in response to these infections. The plaque was shown to function as an antimicrobial peptide, a basic part of the human immune response. This suggests that amyloid plaque accumulation in Alzheimer's patients may be a functional response to pathogens (viruses, bacteria, or fungi) that gradually infiltrate brain tissue, potentially via pathways like the vagus nerve.
*   **Process Visualization:**
    Pathogen (Virus/Bacteria/Fungi) enters Brain Tissue (e.g., via Vagus Nerve)
    -> Pathogen presence in brain
    -> Amyloid Plaque formation (as Antimicrobial Peptide)
    -> Inflammation and Neurofibrillary Tangles
    -> Alzheimer's Disease Progression

Cytomegalovirus (CMV), another herpesvirus, has been observed concentrated within the amyloid plaques of brain tissue from Alzheimer's patients. This accumulation is associated with detrimental glial immune cell activation, a significant driver of the Alzheimer's disease process.

## Therapeutic and Diagnostic Approaches

There are existing drugs, antivirals, antibiotics, and natural supplements with antimicrobial activity that could be utilized to prevent pathogen activity contributing to aging and disease.

### Antivirals for Dementia Risk

Herpesvirus antivirals are a readily available option.
*   **Study:** A team in Taiwan analyzed medical records from thousands of people.
*   **Findings:** Individuals frequently taking common anti-herpesvirus medications (e.g., Valcyte, Famvir) had a significantly lower risk (almost 10 times lower) of developing dementia over time compared to those not taking them.
*   **Clinical Trial:** A clinical trial is underway to test valganciclovir (a herpes antiviral) in patients with pre-dementia to assess its ability to prevent progression to Alzheimer's disease.

### SARS-CoV-2 Persistence and Long COVID

SARS-CoV-2 can persist in at least some individuals, acting as a chronic virus that accumulates in tissues and causes disease, potentially becoming another member of the human virome.

**Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 Persistence:**
*   **Methodology:** Gut tissue samples were collected via endoscopy from patients after COVID infection.
*   **Findings:** Genetic material of SARS-CoV-2, including double-stranded RNA indicative of active viral replication, was detected in gut tissue up to two years post-infection. The virus was observed clustered within immune cells, seemingly downregulating the immune response and preventing effective targeting.
*   Multiple studies have found SARS-CoV-2 RNA or protein in tissue samples (e.g., gut, lung) or host cells (e.g., platelets, monocytes) months or years after initial infection.

### Rapamycin for Long COVID

A clinical trial is currently running at Mount Sinai to investigate low-dose rapamycin (2-4 mg once weekly) for long COVID patients, given its potential longevity benefits and immune modulating effects.

**Observed Effects of Rapalog Dosing (Rapamycin Analogs):**
*   **Increased Antiviral Gene Expression:** Six weeks of rapalog dosing led to an increase in interferon-induced antiviral gene expression. Interferons are crucial for controlling viruses and maintaining latency.
*   **Enhanced Vaccine Response:** Patients taking rapalogs showed a more robust antibody response to influenza vaccination, suggesting strengthened immune function against infections.
*   **Reduced Infection Rate:** Participants on rapamycin reported a lower rate of respiratory and UTI infections for up to a year after a short course of treatment.
*   **Improved T-Cell Exhaustion:** Rapalog use was associated with improvements in T-cell exhaustion, a common phenomenon in chronic viral infections where T-cells become less effective due to persistent activation.

The Long COVID trial is measuring interferon gene expression, T-cell exhaustion, immune response parameters, and specific viral activity to determine if rapamycin helps control viral activity, potentially linking to its longevity effects.

### Lumbrokinase/Nattokinase for Fibrin Deposition

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein directly drives fibrin formation, leading to the seeding of blood clots. Many long COVID patients exhibit fibrin amyloid microclots in their blood, likely driven by the spike protein. These microclots can accumulate in capillaries, impairing blood flow to organs and the nervous system.

**Anti-fibrinolytic Enzyme Action:**
*   Lumbrokinase (an enzyme extracted from earthworms) and nattokinase (from soybeans) possess anti-fibrinolytic activity, meaning they break down fibrin.
*   **Clinical Trial:** Lumbrokinase is being tested in a clinical trial for long COVID to break up fibrin deposition and microclots.
*   **Broader Application:** Fibrin formation is also seeded by a wide range of bacterial and fungal pathogens. Bacteria often form biofilms with fibrin as a matrix to persist against the host immune response. Therefore, these enzymes could address pathogen-driven fibrin deposition and biofilm structures beyond just SARS-CoV-2.

## The Importance of Tissue Samples for Diagnostics

To understand viral activity in aging and chronic disease, studying blood samples alone is insufficient because persistent pathogens often reside in tissues, not circulating blood.

**Rationale for Tissue Sampling:**
*   **Pathogen Evasion:** Persistent pathogens (reservoirs) tend to move out of the bloodstream and into tissues or nerves, where the immune system is less likely to recognize and clear them.
*   **Diagnostic Gap:** Traditional blood analysis, while convenient, frequently misses these tissue-resident pathogens, contributing to the underestimation of their role in aging and chronic disease.
*   **Methodology:** The PolyBio Research Foundation extensively collects tissue samples from patients with long COVID, Alzheimer's, and cardiovascular disease. This involves:
    *   Working with surgeons to obtain samples during surgery.
    *   Patients undergoing biopsy procedures (e.g., lymph nodes, gut tissue, peripheral nervous system).
    *   Stabilizing and preparing samples for advanced research.
    *   Analyzing unique tissue types for viruses and other pathogens via sequencing.

## Q&A Insights

### Autoimmunity and Microbial Burden
Autoimmune diseases, traditionally defined by self-destruction, are increasingly understood to have a large component driven by undiagnosed intracellular infections. For example, EBV is strongly implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS) through molecular mimicry, where an EBV protein structurally resembles a human glialcam protein, leading the immune system to cross-react and attack human tissue. Chronic diseases are often polymicrobial, not necessarily a "one pathogen, one disease" situation, as different pathogens can induce similar detrimental outcomes.

### Limitations of Current Diagnostics
Current clinical diagnostics for persistent pathogens are limited compared to research capabilities:
*   **Blood Markers:** While IgG/IgM levels can indicate immune recognition of pathogens and may be elevated in aging, they provide a blunt measure, not detailing pathogen activity, specific proteins, or recent encounters.
*   **Advanced T-cell Diagnostics:** In research labs, T-cell activity can be precisely analyzed to identify specific pathogens and even particular viral proteins they are responding to, indicating active infection. These "biosensor" T-cells can offer insights into the recency of pathogen encounters.
*   **Tissue-Based Diagnostics:**
    *   **Gut Biopsies:** Procedures like flexible sigmoidoscopy can obtain gut tissue. This tissue can then be analyzed using sequencing tools to identify resident viruses and pathogens. The gut is often an initial site of viral accumulation, with evidence suggesting pathogens may ascend from the gut (e.g., via the vagus nerve) to the brain, contributing to conditions like Alzheimer's.
    *   **Metabolomics:** Analyzing plasma metabolome shifts (e.g., increases in indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate, which are dysbiotic bacterial metabolites) can provide readouts of infectious burden and gut health. Depletion of host metabolites like glutathione could also signal microbial infection.

### Gut Microbiome and Viral Persistence
The relationship between the gut microbiome and persistent viral infection is bidirectional:
*   **Pathogen Influence on Microbiome:** A persistent pathogen in the gut lining can downregulate the local immune system, creating an environment where the microbiome can become dysbiotic. This dysbiosis, characterized by problematic bacterial activity, can further perpetuate chronic disease.
*   **Microbiome Influence on Pathogen:** A pre-existing dysbiotic microbiome with inflammation may create a more favorable environment for viruses to persist, hindering their clearance.
*   **Consequences:** Both viral persistence and microbiome dysbiosis can lead to chronic inflammation, increased gut permeability ("leaky gut"), and the translocation of pathogens or their products (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, bacterial endotoxins) into the bloodstream, triggering systemic issues like clotting problems.
*   **Gut-Lung Axis:** Short-chain fatty acids produced by gut bacteria (e.g., from inulin) can enhance survival after viral infections, indicating a connection between gut health and systemic immune response.

### Senescence and Antiviral Mechanisms
Cellular senescence can act as an antiviral mechanism, but senescent cells can also release pro-inflammatory factors, creating a vicious cycle of immune dysregulation and inflammation in infected tissues.

### Strategies for Supporting Gut Health
Microbiome-based approaches are considered important for chronic conditions associated with viruses. Probiotics that convert lactic acid into short-chain fatty acids, like butyrate, could improve the gut environment and disrupt the vicious cycle of pathogen persistence and inflammation.

### Plaque Disruption
Once amyloid plaques form in response to infection, they remain problematic. Emerging strategies for plaque disruption include:
*   **Ultrasound Frequencies:** Disrupting plaques in the brain using ultrasound frequencies is an area of experimental research.
*   **Lymphatic System Flushing:** Procedures to enhance lymphatic drainage in the brain, potentially flushing out amyloid, have shown anecdotal benefits in Alzheimer's patients. Maintaining a healthy lymphatic system through good sleep and drainage techniques is broadly beneficial for detoxification.
*   **Magnetic Protocols:** Low-frequency magnetic fields are being explored for their potential to rejuvenate mitochondria and reduce neuroinflammation.
