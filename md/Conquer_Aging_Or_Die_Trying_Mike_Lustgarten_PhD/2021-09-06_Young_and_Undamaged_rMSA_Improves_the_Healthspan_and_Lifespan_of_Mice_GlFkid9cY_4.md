# 2021-09-06 Young and Undamaged rMSA Improves the Healthspan and Lifespan of Mice

## Executive Summary

*   Recombinant mouse serum albumin (rMSA) injections significantly extended the average lifespan of C57BL/6 mice by approximately 19%.
*   rMSA treatment improved healthspan markers in mice, including increased muscle strength and enhanced spatial learning and memory.
*   rMSA injections led to reduced levels of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in the brains of treated mice, a protein associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology.
*   The rMSA used in the study was characterized as "young and less damaged" compared to endogenous albumin from aged mice, exhibiting fewer signs of oxidation and glycation.
*   The study suggests that the quality and damage level of circulating albumin may significantly impact healthspan and lifespan, with younger, less damaged albumin conferring benefits.

## Methodology

*   **Recombinant Mouse Serum Albumin (rMSA) Production:**
    *   Mouse isoform of albumin was expressed and purified from *Pichia pastoris* yeast.
*   **Animal Model:**
    *   C57BL/6 mice, starting at 12 months of age.
*   **Treatment Protocol:**
    *   Mice were injected with either rMSA or saline (control) every three weeks until death.
    *   The study duration for healthspan measures was eight months (from 12 to 20 months of age).
*   **Outcome Measures:**
    *   Lifespan
    *   Muscle mass and strength (grip strength, gastrocnemius muscle mass)
    *   Cognitive ability (Barnes Maze for spatial learning and memory)
    *   Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) levels in the brain
    *   Fur quality
    *   Body weight
    *   Blood albumin levels
    *   Albumin damage markers (free thiols, protein carbonyls, homocysteine, advanced glycation end products)

## Mouse Data

### Lifespan Extension

*   **Female and Male Mice:**
    *   Saline-injected control mice had an average lifespan of approximately 19 months.
    *   Albumin-injected mice showed a significant extension in average lifespan.
*   **Individual Sex Data:**
    *   Both female and male mice demonstrated a significant increase in average lifespan following albumin injections compared to saline controls.
*   **Magnitude of Increase:**
    *   The average lifespan increase was approximately 19%. This translates to a potential gain of about 15 years for an individual with an average human lifespan of 80 years.

### Healthspan Improvements

*   **Muscle Strength:**
    *   **Female Mice:** Higher grip strength observed in albumin-injected mice compared to saline controls.
    *   **Male Mice:** Higher grip strength observed in albumin-injected mice compared to saline controls.
*   **Muscle Mass:**
    *   **Initial Observation (Female & Male):** Trends for higher gastrocnemius muscle mass in albumin-injected mice were observed but were not statistically significant, potentially due to sample size limitations.
    *   **Combined Data (Male & Female):** When combining data for both sexes, a statistically significant increase in muscle mass was detected in albumin-injected mice compared to saline controls.
*   **Cognitive Ability (Spatial Learning and Memory - Barnes Maze):**
    *   **Escape Success:** A significantly higher fraction of albumin-injected mice were able to find the escape hole in the Barnes Maze compared to saline controls.
    *   **Time to Escape:** Albumin-injected mice took a shorter time to find the escape hole compared to saline-injected controls.
    *   **Conclusion:** Albumin treatment improved spatial learning and memory.
*   **Phosphorylated Tau (p-tau) Levels in the Brain:**
    *   **Pathophysiology:** Hyperphosphorylated tau destabilizes microtubules, leading to aggregation, neuronal death, and progressive neuronal damage, as seen in Alzheimer's disease.
    *   **Male Mice:** Saline-treated male mice had significantly lower levels of p-tau compared to a control group (data not explicitly detailed but implied comparison).
    *   **Combined Data (Male & Female):** Albumin-injected mice showed significantly reduced levels of phosphorylated tau in the brain compared to saline-injected controls. (Note: A trend was observed in female mice, but it was not statistically significant, potentially due to small sample size).
*   **Fur Quality:**
    *   Albumin-treated mice exhibited glossier and thicker fur with less hair loss compared to saline-treated mice, which showed signs of poor hair quality and some hair loss.

## Mechanism of Action: Albumin Quality and Damage

### Body Weight and Caloric Intake

*   **Body Weight:** No significant difference in body weight was observed between albumin-injected and saline-injected mice. This suggests that the observed healthspan and lifespan benefits are unlikely due to calorie restriction.
*   **Food Intake:** Food intake was not reported, but the stable body weight suggests no substantial difference in caloric intake between groups.

### Albumin Levels and Aging

*   **Human Data:** Albumin levels in humans show a clear decrease with age, from youth to approximately 100 years.
*   **Mouse Data (Albumin Levels):** Albumin injections maintained stable blood albumin levels in mice throughout the 21-day injection cycle. The injections did not reverse the age-related decline in endogenous albumin levels.

### Albumin Damage Metrics

The rMSA injected into the mice was characterized as "young and less damaged" compared to endogenous albumin from aged mice.

*   **Free Thiols (Index of Oxidative Stress):**
    *   **Trend in Aging Mice:** Free thiol levels in endogenous albumin decreased with age in mice, consistent with increased oxidative stress.
    *   **Injected rMSA:** The injected rMSA had higher levels of free thiols, indicating lower levels of oxidatively damaged albumin.
*   **Protein Carbonyls (Index of Oxidative Stress):**
    *   **Trend in Aging Mice:** Protein carbonyl levels in endogenous albumin increased with age in mice, correlating with rising oxidative stress.
    *   **Injected rMSA:** The injected rMSA had levels of protein carbonyls similar to those found in young endogenous albumin, suggesting low oxidative damage.
*   **Homocysteine Bound to Albumin (S-homocysteinylation):**
    *   **Trend in Aging Mice:** The amount of homocysteine bound to albumin increased with age in mice.
    *   **Injected rMSA:** The injected rMSA had even lower levels of bound homocysteine compared to albumin in very young mice (1.5 months old), indicating less homocysteine modification.
*   **Age Product Adducts (Advanced Glycation End Products - AGEs):**
    *   **Trend in Aging Mice:** AGEs in endogenous albumin increased with age in mice.
    *   **Injected rMSA:** The injected rMSA had lower levels of glycation (AGEs) compared to endogenous albumin, indicating less glycation damage.

### Albumin Damage in Treated vs. Control Mice

Comparing albumin from 20-month-old mice that received either rMSA or saline injections:

*   **Albumin in rMSA-injected mice showed:**
    *   Lower levels of carbonyls.
    *   Lower levels of glycation.
    *   Lower levels of homocysteine bound to albumin.
*   **Free thiols:** Not significantly different between the albumin in rMSA-injected mice and the albumin in saline-injected mice.

**Conclusion from Damage Metrics:** The study suggests that the magnitude of damage to albumin by oxidants, sugars, and homocysteine is associated with healthspan and lifespan.

## Future Directions and Considerations

*   The observed positive effects of albumin injections raise the question of whether similar interventions could be beneficial for human Alzheimer's disease pathology.
*   The authors suggest that this approach could be extended to other less abundant blood proteins like immunoglobulins or fibrinogen, aiming to inject young, less damaged versions into aged animals to promote healthspan and longevity.
*   **Caveat:** The control group (saline-injected) in this study exhibited a lower average lifespan (19 months) than typically observed for C57BL/6 mice (around 30 months). This raises a potential question about whether the observed benefits were partly due to a lifespan-reducing effect of the saline injections. Further studies are needed to confirm the effects independently.
