# 2020-07-12 Blood testing for total cholesterol - What's optimal

## Executive Summary

*   Total cholesterol levels generally increase with age until approximately 50-56 years, after which they decline.
*   A U-shaped association exists between total cholesterol levels and all-cause mortality risk across a large population study.
*   For older adults (65+), the lowest risk of all-cause mortality is observed with total cholesterol levels between 210-249 mg/dL.
*   For younger adults (35-44), optimal cholesterol ranges shift, with different optimal ranges for men and women and less pronounced increased risk at lower levels.
*   For the youngest women (18-34), cholesterol levels below 160 mg/dL were not associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality.

## Total Cholesterol Levels and Aging

*   In 18-year-olds, total cholesterol levels are approximately 170 mg/dL for women and 160 mg/dL for men.
*   Cholesterol levels increase with age:
    *   Women: Increase from ~170 mg/dL to ~210 mg/dL around age 50, peaking at approximately 56 years.
    *   Men: Increase from ~160 mg/dL to ~200 mg/dL around age 48-50.
*   After these peak ages, total cholesterol levels tend to decline towards the end of life.

## Total Cholesterol and All-Cause Mortality Risk

### Overall Population (All Ages)

*   A U-shaped association is observed between total cholesterol levels and all-cause mortality risk.
*   The lowest risk of death for all causes is found for total cholesterol levels between 210-249 mg/dL.
*   Risk of death increases at levels below this range.
*   Risk of death for all causes increases above 249 mg/dL.
*   Levels less than approximately 140 mg/dL in women and 150 mg/dL in men are associated with higher all-cause mortality risk than very high levels (up to 300 mg/dL). This suggests lower cholesterol is not always better.

### Age-Specific Mortality Risk

#### Adults 75-99 Years

*   The range of 210-249 mg/dL is associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality.
*   Lower cholesterol levels (below ~140 mg/dL) show a higher risk of all-cause mortality compared to very high levels (~280-300 mg/dL).
*   The mortality risk curve in this age group is relatively flat.

#### Adults 65-74 Years

*   Similar trend to the 75-99 age group, with 210-249 mg/dL associated with the lowest risk.
*   Increasing risk of all-cause mortality is observed with both lower and higher cholesterol levels relative to the 210-249 mg/dL range.

#### Adults 45-64 Years

*   The trend remains similar, with 210-249 mg/dL generally considered optimal.
*   Lower cholesterol levels appear to have a higher risk than higher cholesterol levels, but risk is elevated at both low and high levels relative to the 210-249 mg/dL range.

#### Adults 35-44 Years

*   **Women:**
    *   180-220 mg/dL is associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality.
    *   Risk increases significantly for levels 130-139 mg/dL and below 120 mg/dL.
    *   Risk also increases for levels greater than 280 mg/dL.
    *   Lower levels (<140 mg/dL) do not appear to impart a higher risk compared to levels >280 mg/dL in this group.
*   **Men:**
    *   210-229 mg/dL is associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality.
    *   Risk increases for levels less than 210 mg/dL.
    *   Risk also increases for levels between 230-239 mg/dL and greater than 250 mg/dL.

#### Women 18-34 Years

*   160-200 mg/dL is associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality.
*   There is no significant increase in all-cause mortality risk for cholesterol levels lower than 160 mg/dL. This contrasts with other age groups.
*   Very high values (>280 mg/dL) are associated with higher risk.

#### Men 18-34 Years

*   180-220 mg/dL is associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality.
*   Risk increases at total cholesterol levels less than 150 mg/dL.
*   Risk also increases at levels greater than 260 mg/dL.
*   This age group exhibits a U-shaped curve with different optimal values compared to older age groups.
