# 2024-07-07 What s Optimal For Grip Strength During Aging

## Executive Summary

*   Grip strength generally peaks between 35-45 years old (men: ~35-40 years, women: ~40-45 years) before declining with age.
*   Higher grip strength is significantly associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk. The highest grip strength categories correlate with up to a 65% reduction in risk of death for all causes.
*   Optimal grip strength for longevity is defined as greater than 50 kg for men and at least greater than 33 kg for women.
*   The Jamar Dynamometer is the clinical gold standard for measuring grip strength, but the Camry EH101 Dynamometer offers a strongly correlated, more affordable alternative.
*   For optimal accuracy when using the Camry EH101, it is recommended to take an average or maximal value over six measurements.

## Grip Strength Decline with Aging

Grip strength peaks around 35-40 years for men, reaching approximately 50 kilograms. For women, it peaks slightly later, around 40-45 years, at approximately 33 kilograms. Following these peaks, grip strength consistently declines during aging for both men and women.

## Grip Strength and All-Cause Mortality Risk

A meta-analysis of 42 studies, including over 3,000,000 people, explored the relationship between grip strength and all-cause mortality risk. The findings indicate that:

*   A relatively higher grip strength is significantly associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk.
*   This significant association holds for all levels of grip strength greater than approximately 9 kilograms.
*   The maximal effect of this association is observed at grip strengths greater than 54 kilograms.
*   The highest grip strength measured was significantly associated with a 65% reduced risk of death for all causes.

Based on these findings, optimal grip strength levels for longevity are defined as:
*   **Men:** Greater than 50 kg
*   **Women:** At least greater than 33 kg

Avoiding age-related decline in grip strength is crucial for maintaining these optimal levels.

## Measuring Grip Strength

Grip strength can be tracked and potentially optimized.

### Measurement Devices

*   **Jamar Dynamometer:** Considered the gold standard for clinical grip strength measurement, typically costing $300 or more.
*   **Camry EH101 Dynamometer:** A more affordable alternative that has been shown to be strongly correlated with the Jamar dynamometer.

### Correlation Between Jamar and Camry Dynamometers

**1. Study in Younger Adults (Average Age 42 Years Old):**
A significant positive correlation (correlation coefficient of 0.94) exists between the Camry and Jamar grip strength meters. This indicates the Camry is a highly reliable alternative to the gold standard in younger populations.

**2. Study in Older Adults (Average Age 66 Years Old):**
A study combining measurements from both Jamar and Camry devices in older adults also demonstrated strong correlations:

*   **Dominant Hand (Average Value):** Correlation coefficient of 0.821
*   **Dominant Hand (Maximal Value):** Correlation coefficient of 0.81

### Protocol for Optimal Camry Use

To achieve the best accuracy when using the Camry dynamometer:

*   Take six measurements.
*   Calculate either the average value or the maximal value from these six measurements.

This method yielded even stronger correlations:

*   Correlation for average value: 0.855
*   Correlation for maximal value: 0.852

Both studies confirm that the Camry grip strength meter is significantly correlated with the gold standard Jamar grip strength meter in both young and older adults.
