# 2025-08-03 Can Dietary Sodium Reduce Grey Hair

## Executive Summary

*   Resiniferatoxin (RTX) induces hair graying in mice, correlating with a significant increase in plasma norepinephrine levels.
*   Treatment with Buprenorphine (BUP) reverses RTX-induced hair graying in mice and decreases plasma norepinephrine levels.
*   Plasma norepinephrine levels increase with age in humans, mirroring the age-related increase in hair graying.
*   Dietary sodium intake appears to inversely affect plasma norepinephrine levels; lower sodium intake correlates with higher norepinephrine, while higher sodium intake correlates with lower norepinephrine.
*   Increasing dietary sodium intake may be associated with lower plasma norepinephrine levels, potentially influencing hair graying, but also with increased blood pressure.

## Mouse Data

### RTX-Induced Hair Graying and Norepinephrine Increase

*   Treatment with Resiniferatoxin (RTX) causes hair graying in mice.
*   This hair graying occurs alongside a more than 10-fold increase in plasma norepinephrine (noradrenaline) levels.

### Buprenorphine (BUP) Reverses Hair Graying and Decreases Norepinephrine

*   When RTX-treated mice (with gray hair) are subsequently treated with Buprenorphine (BUP), hair graying is reversed.
*   This reversal of gray hair is accompanied by a decrease in plasma norepinephrine levels to those observed in control (saline-treated) mice.
*   These findings support the hypothesis that plasma norepinephrine levels are involved in the mechanisms of hair graying.

## Human Evidence

### Norepinephrine and Aging

*   Plasma norepinephrine levels increase significantly with age in both men and women.
*   The correlation coefficient (r) for this age-related increase is approximately 0.5 (p < 0.05).
*   Average plasma norepinephrine levels in 20-year-olds are around 150 pg/mL, doubling to approximately 300-350 pg/mL in 70-year-olds.
*   This age-related increase in norepinephrine parallels the general increase in hair graying with aging.

### Dietary Sodium and Plasma Norepinephrine

#### Study 1: Sodium Intake and Plasma Norepinephrine (18-46 year olds)

*   **Low Sodium Intake (460 mg/day):** Resulted in plasma norepinephrine levels approximating those of 70-year-olds (300-350 pg/mL). This suggests that sodium restriction can induce a biochemical phenotype similar to aging.
*   **Normal Sodium Intake (2760 mg/day):** Led to a significant decrease in plasma norepinephrine levels (around 250 pg/mL), although still relatively high.
*   **High Sodium Intake (4600 mg/day):** Caused the largest reduction in plasma norepinephrine, bringing levels close to youthful levels (around 150 pg/mL).
*   This study indicates a potential inverse relationship between dietary sodium intake and plasma norepinephrine levels, with higher intake leading to lower norepinephrine.

#### Study 2: Urine Sodium Excretion and Plasma Norepinephrine (20-45 year olds)

*   This study utilized urine sodium levels to approximate dietary sodium intake, with conversions noting 1 mEq = 23 mg sodium, and urine sodium ≈ 90% of dietary intake.
    *   Urine Sodium 100-200 mEq -> Approximate Dietary Intake ~1300-2600 mg/day
    *   Urine Sodium 200-300 mEq -> Approximate Dietary Intake ~2600-3900 mg/day
    *   Urine Sodium 300+ mEq -> Approximate Dietary Intake ~3900+ mg/day

*   **Lowest Dietary Sodium Intake (~1300 mg/day):** Associated with the highest plasma norepinephrine levels (more than double average values from the previous study, around 600 pg/mL), exceeding typical levels even in older adults.
*   **Increasing Dietary Sodium Intake (~2600 mg/day to ~3900 mg/day):** Correlated with decreasing plasma norepinephrine levels, reaching close to youthful levels (~200 pg/mL).
*   **Higher Dietary Sodium Intake (~3900 mg/day to ~6400 mg/day):** This range showed a potential U-shaped association, with plasma norepinephrine levels around 400 pg/mL at ~3900 mg/day and increasing again to ~400 pg/mL at ~6400 mg/day, still above youthful levels but lower than extremely low sodium intake.
*   This study suggests a U-shaped relationship may exist between sodium intake and plasma norepinephrine, where both very low and potentially very high intakes could be detrimental, with intermediate higher intakes being associated with lower norepinephrine.

## Conundrum: Sodium Intake, Hair Graying, and Blood Pressure

### Sodium Intake and Blood Pressure (Meta-analysis of 11 studies)

*   **Sodium Intake < 2 grams/day:** Associated with a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP), though the effect size is small (approx. 3 mmHg).
*   **Sodium Intake > 2 grams/day:** Significantly associated with higher SBP.
*   Increasing sodium intake is generally associated with higher blood pressure, a risk factor for heart disease.

### The Dilemma

*   **High Sodium Intake:** May lower plasma norepinephrine, potentially reversing or slowing hair graying. However, it is associated with increased blood pressure.
*   **Low Sodium Intake:** May lead to lower blood pressure, reducing cardiovascular disease risk. However, it may result in higher plasma norepinephrine levels, potentially exacerbating hair graying.

## Biomarker Considerations

### Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Resting Heart Rate (RHR)

*   HRV and RHR are influenced by the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.
*   Norepinephrine, released by sympathetic nerves, can impact HRV and RHR.
*   Optimizing sodium intake may involve considering its effects on HRV and RHR alongside blood pressure and hair graying.

## Personal Observations and Experimentation

*   The speaker tracks dietary intake meticulously, including sodium.
*   **Low Sodium Diet (1600 mg/day):** Associated with relatively youthful blood pressure (115/69 mmHg) but potentially high plasma norepinephrine.
*   **Hypothesis Testing for Workout Days:** To investigate the impact of higher sodium on recovery from exercise-induced sympathetic activation, the speaker plans to increase sodium intake to 2800-3000 mg/day on workout days.
*   **Non-Workout Days:** The speaker aims for lower sodium intake, around 2000-2400 mg/day, expecting less plasma norepinephrine due to reduced sympathetic activation.
*   The goal is to find an optimal dietary sodium intake that balances effects on blood pressure, HRV, RHR, and potentially hair graying.
