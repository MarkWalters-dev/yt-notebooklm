# 2022-04-10 Calcium Intake Affects The Association For Dietary Oxalate With CVD-Event Risk

## Executive Summary

*   High dietary oxalate intake is significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events.
*   The association between dietary oxalate and CVD risk is mitigated by higher calcium intake.
*   In individuals consuming low calcium diets, high oxalate intake was linked to a substantial increase in CVD event risk.
*   In individuals consuming medium to high calcium diets, the significant association between high oxalate intake and CVD events was lost.
*   Adequate calcium intake appears to reduce the absorption of dietary oxalate, thereby mitigating its potential adverse effects on cardiovascular health.

## Study Overview

This study investigated the association between dietary oxalate intake and the incidence of cardiovascular events, examining the potential modulating role of dietary calcium. The study followed an Asian population for ten years.

### Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Related Events Definition

CVD-related events included:

*   Probable and definite myocardial infarction (heart attack).
*   Unstable angina pectoris.
*   Angiographic confirmed coronary heart disease (atherosclerosis).
*   Any cardiovascular death (including fatal heart attack, coronary heart disease, or stroke).

## Dietary Oxalate Intake and CVD Event Risk

Dietary oxalate intake was categorized into three tertiles:

*   **Low Oxalate Intake:** Median value of 120 mg/day.
*   **Medium Oxalate Intake:** Median value of 181 mg/day.
*   **High Oxalate Intake:** Median value of 277 mg/day.

### Unadjusted Association

*   Compared to the lowest oxalate intake tertile, tertiles 2 and 3 showed a statistically significant increase in CVD event risk. This indicates a crude association between higher oxalate intake and increased CVD risk.

### Adjusted Associations

*   **Model 1 (Age, Total Cholesterol, HDL, Systolic Blood Pressure, Hypertension Treatment, Smoking, Type 2 Diabetes):** After adjusting for these factors, a statistically significant association remained for the highest oxalate intake group (tertile 3) with increased CVD event risk. The intermediate group (tertile 2) was no longer significantly associated.
*   **Model 2 (Model 1 + Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)):** After further adjustment for kidney function, the highest oxalate intake group still showed a significant association with a 60% increased risk for CVD events. The intermediate group remained not statistically significant.
*   **Model 3 (Model 1 + Model 2 + Calorie, Fat, and Fiber Intake):** In this model, statistical significance was lost. However, the confidence interval for the highest oxalate intake group remained above one, suggesting a potential increased risk (a 47% increase was observed), though not statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level.

**Conclusion from adjusted models:** Higher dietary oxalate intake is significantly associated with an increased CVD event risk, particularly in the highest intake group, even after adjusting for several important confounding factors.

## Factors Associated with CVD Events

Individuals who experienced a CVD-related event (compared to those who did not) were generally:

*   Older.
*   More likely to be male.
*   More likely to be smokers.
*   Had a higher BMI.
*   Had a greater waist circumference.
*   Had higher blood pressure (systolic and diastolic).
*   Had higher glucose levels.
*   Had higher triglycerides.
*   Had lower HDL cholesterol.
*   Had worse kidney function (higher serum creatinine, lower eGFR).

## The Role of Dietary Calcium in Oxalate Absorption

Dietary calcium can significantly impact the absorption of dietary oxalate from the intestinal tract into the systemic circulation.

### Mechanism of Calcium Action

1.  **Free Oxalate:** Free oxalate anions (Ox²⁻) in the intestine can be absorbed into the bloodstream.
2.  **Calcium Binding:** In the presence of dietary calcium, calcium binds to oxalate.
3.  **Targeted Excretion:** This calcium-oxalate complex is less readily absorbed and is primarily targeted for excretion in feces.

**Therefore, higher dietary calcium intake is expected to lead to reduced absorption of dietary oxalate, consequently reducing its accumulation in the body and potentially lowering its adverse health effects.**

### Other Oxalate Elimination Pathways

*   **Urinary Excretion:** Free oxalate in the blood can be filtered and excreted by the kidneys in urine. This pathway is efficient when kidney function is good.
*   **Hepatic Production:** The liver can produce oxalate via glycolate metabolism.
*   **Red Blood Cell Release:** Oxalate can also be released from red blood cells.

## Impact of Dietary Calcium on Oxalate-CVD Association

The study analyzed CVD event risk versus dietary oxalate intake across different calcium consumption levels (low, medium, and high).

*   **Low Calcium Diet (Median intake: 760 mg/day):**
    *   A statistically significant association was found between dietary oxalate intake and CVD event risk.
    *   Compared to individuals on a low oxalate, low calcium diet, those on a higher oxalate, low calcium diet showed significantly increased risk:
        *   Tertile 2 (181 mg/day oxalate): 92% increased risk.
        *   Tertile 3 (277 mg/day oxalate): 142% increased risk.

*   **Medium Calcium Diet (Median intake: 1180 mg/day):**
    *   No significant associations were found between dietary oxalate intake and CVD event risk.
    *   Confidence intervals for tertiles 2 and 3 overlapped with one, indicating no statistically significant difference compared to the lowest oxalate intake group.

*   **High Calcium Diet (Median intake: 1760 mg/day):**
    *   Similar to the medium calcium diet, no significant associations were found between dietary oxalate intake and CVD event risk.
    *   Confidence intervals for tertiles 2 and 3 overlapped with one.

**Key Finding:** While high dietary oxalate intake is associated with increased CVD risk in individuals consuming low amounts of calcium, this association is not observed in individuals consuming medium to high amounts of calcium (around 1180 mg/day or more).

## Personal Context Analysis

The speaker's estimated daily oxalate intake was approximately 1400 mg/day, placing them in the highest oxalate intake tertile (median 277 mg/day). Their average daily calcium intake was 1219 mg/day, placing them in the medium calcium diet group.

Based on the study's findings, the speaker's high oxalate intake in conjunction with their medium calcium intake did *not* show a significantly increased CVD event risk when compared to lower oxalate intakes on a similar medium calcium diet. This suggests that their relatively high calcium intake may be mitigating the potential cardiovascular risks associated with their high oxalate consumption.
