# 2021-04-25 C-Reactive Protein - What s Optimal A Comprehensive Review

## Executive Summary

*   C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase reactant produced by the liver in response to infection (via PAMPs and NF-κB signaling) and by adipose tissue during sterile inflammation (via DAMPs and inflammasome activation).
*   High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels generally increase with age, rising significantly in individuals over 70 and continuing to climb in centenarians and supercentenarians.
*   Numerous studies consistently demonstrate that lower hs-CRP levels are associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk. Optimal ranges identified generally fall below 1 mg/L, with strong evidence suggesting even lower levels, such as 0.3 mg/L or less, are ideal for health and longevity.
*   Among a range of common clinical biomarkers, CRP shows the strongest correlation with an older epigenetic age, as measured by both PhenoAge and GRIMAge epigenetic clocks. This suggests that maintaining lower CRP levels may be linked to a younger biological age.

## C-Reactive Protein Production

CRP is produced in the body through two primary pathways:

### In Response to Infection (Acute Phase Response)

1.  **Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs)** on bacterial cell surfaces bind to TLR receptors on macrophages.
2.  This induces **NF-κB signaling** within the macrophages.
3.  Macrophages release pro-inflammatory cytokines, including **IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α**.
4.  These cytokines travel to the liver.
5.  The liver is induced to produce **C-Reactive Protein**.

### In the Absence of Infection (Sterile Inflammation)

1.  **Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs)**, resulting from tissue injury, bind to receptors on macrophages.
2.  This activates **inflammasomes** within the macrophages.
3.  Macrophages release pro-inflammatory cytokines, including **IL-1β and IL-18**.
4.  These cytokines travel to fat cells (adipose tissue).
5.  Adipose tissue is induced to release **C-Reactive Protein**.

## C-Reactive Protein Measures

There are two main measures of C-reactive protein:

*   **Standard CRP test:** Measures CRP levels from 10 to 1000 milligrams per liter (mg/L).
*   **High-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) test:** Measures CRP levels from 0.2 to 10 mg/L, providing greater detail in the lower range relevant to chronic inflammation.

## CRP Levels and Aging

Studies show that hs-CRP levels tend to increase with age.

*   **Youth (<40 years old):** hs-CRP values are typically less than 1 mg/L.
*   **Aging (40s, 50s, 60s, 70s):** hs-CRP levels progressively increase.
*   **Extreme Longevity:**
    *   **70-year-olds (offspring/spouses of centenarians):** Average hs-CRP of 0.7 mg/L.
    *   **85-99 year-olds (average age 87):** Average hs-CRP increased to 0.9 mg/L.
    *   **Centenarians (average age 101):** Average hs-CRP increased to 1.6 mg/L.
    *   **Semicentenarians (average age 107):** Average hs-CRP reached 2.5 mg/L.
    *   **Supercentenarians (110+ years old, average age 111):** Average hs-CRP was 2.1 mg/L.
    This represents a threefold increase in hs-CRP from 70-year-olds to supercentenarians.

## CRP and All-Cause Mortality Risk

Numerous studies investigating the correlation between hs-CRP levels and all-cause mortality consistently suggest that lower levels are associated with better survival and reduced risk of death.

*   **Initial Findings (Comparison to <1 mg/L):**
    *   A study in over 6,100 subjects, after full adjustment for demographics and risk factors, found that individuals with hs-CRP >3 mg/L had a 54% increased risk of all-cause mortality compared to those with hs-CRP <1 mg/L.
*   **Consistently Lower Risk with <1 mg/L:**
    *   A study of approximately 3,600 individuals (58 years old at onset, followed for 13 years) demonstrated that those with hs-CRP levels <1 mg/L had the best cumulative survival. Levels of 1-3 mg/L and >3 mg/L were associated with 35% and 88% increased risks of all-cause mortality, respectively.
    *   Another study identified hs-CRP >3 mg/L with a 41% increased risk of all-cause mortality compared to <1 mg/L.
*   **Lowering the Optimal Threshold:**
    *   In a study of over 7,000 subjects, the lowest all-cause mortality risk was observed for hs-CRP between 0.5 and 0.9 mg/L, with significantly increased risk for levels >5 mg/L.
    *   Further analysis in a fully adjusted model indicated that hs-CRP levels ≤0.9 mg/L had the lowest all-cause mortality risk. Levels >3.39 mg/L were associated with a 40-46% higher risk of death.
*   **Seeking Even Lower Optimal Levels:**
    *   A study of over 14,000 subjects (52 years old at baseline, followed for 10 years) found the lowest risk of all-cause mortality for hs-CRP levels <0.7 mg/L, with all values above this threshold associated with significantly increased risk.
    *   A smaller study in men (53 years old, followed for 15 years) identified hs-CRP levels averaging 0.6 mg/L with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality.
    *   In a study involving individuals 59 years old (followed for 4 years), the best survival was found in those with hs-CRP <0.55 mg/L.
    *   A study of approximately 7,500 men indicated the lowest risk for hs-CRP between 0.1 and 0.5 mg/L, with levels >3.1 mg/L linked to increased all-cause mortality risk (similar findings were noted for women with hs-CRP >4 mg/L).
*   **Lowest Thresholds Identified:**
    *   Data from approximately 5,000 subjects (men and women) revealed that the group with hs-CRP in the 0.03 to 0.33 mg/L range experienced the lowest mortality. All-cause mortality was significantly higher for hs-CRP >0.85 mg/L.
    *   Another study similarly identified 0.33 mg/L as associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality, with levels >0.86 mg/L showing an increased risk.
    *   A study including subjects 64 years old (followed for 4 years) indicated the best survival for hs-CRP levels <0.3 mg/L.
    *   A large study of almost 166,000 subjects (40 years old at baseline, followed for 9 years) confirmed that hs-CRP levels of 0.3 mg/L or lower were associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality. Levels >1.1 mg/L were linked to a 40% increased risk of death.
*   **Pushing the Limits (<0.2 mg/L):**
    *   In a study of approximately 2,600 subjects, the lowest all-cause mortality risk was found in individuals with hs-CRP levels <0.21 mg/L. Subjects with hs-CRP >0.44 mg/L had a 41% increased risk, and those with hs-CRP >1.02 mg/L had an 85% increased risk.

Collectively, these studies suggest that as low as possible for hs-CRP may be optimal for health and reduced all-cause mortality risk.

## CRP and Epigenetic Aging

Higher CRP levels are correlated with an older epigenetic age among clinically relevant biomarkers.

*   **PhenoAge:** CRP showed a positive correlation with PhenoAge acceleration, meaning higher CRP levels were associated with an older epigenetic age. Among common clinical biomarkers (insulin, glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol, creatinine, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, waist-to-hip ratio, BMI), CRP exhibited the strongest correlation (0.18) with PhenoAge acceleration.
*   **GRIMAge:** Similar findings were observed with the GRIMAge epigenetic clock. Higher CRP levels were positively correlated with an older epigenetic age, and conversely, lower CRP levels correlated with a younger epigenetic age. Again, CRP demonstrated the strongest correlation with the GRIMAge epigenetic clock when compared to the same list of clinically relevant biomarkers.
