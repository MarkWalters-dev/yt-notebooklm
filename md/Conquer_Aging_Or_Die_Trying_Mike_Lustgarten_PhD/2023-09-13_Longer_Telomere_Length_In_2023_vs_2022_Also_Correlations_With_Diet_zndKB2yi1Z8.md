# 2023-09-13 Longer Telomere Length In 2023 vs 2022 Also Correlations With Diet

## Executive Summary

*   Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) declines with age, and shorter telomeres are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   Personal data shows an increase in average telomere length from 7.04 kb in 2022 to 7.14 kb in 2023, a statistically significant improvement.
*   Calorie intake is inversely correlated with telomere length; lower calorie intake is associated with longer telomeres.
*   After adjusting for calorie intake, higher intake of flaxseed is significantly associated with longer telomere length, while higher intake of Parmesan cheese and cacao beans are significantly associated with shorter telomere length.
*   Certain macronutrients and micronutrients (omega-3, omega-6 to omega-3 ratio, vitamin B1, and copper) showed initial correlations with telomere length but lost statistical significance after adjusting for calorie intake.

## Introduction to Telomeres

*   Telomere length declines during aging in both men and women.
*   **Leukocyte Telomere Length (LTL):** Telomere length measured in white blood cells.
*   **Age-Related Decline:**
    *   Youth telomere length: 7.75 kilobases (kb)
    *   Advanced age telomere length: approximately 5 kb
*   **Significance of Shorter Telomeres:** Associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   A study showed individuals with the longest telomeres had a significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk compared to those with the shortest telomeres over a 14-year follow-up period.

## Key Questions Addressed

1.  Can telomere shortening be slowed during aging?
2.  Which factors may impact telomere length?
3.  What does personal data illustrate regarding these questions?

## Personal Telomere Data

*   **Data Collection:** Blood samples sent to True Diagnostic for telomere length measurement.
*   **Most Recent Data:** July 5, 2023.
*   **Telomere Length (July 2023):** 7.1 kilobases.
    *   This indicates room for improvement compared to youth telomere length (7.75 kb).

## Telomere Length Comparison: 2023 vs. 2022

*   **2022 Average Telomere Length (over three tests):** 7.04 kilobases.
*   **2023 Average Telomere Length:** 7.14 kilobases.
*   **Statistical Significance:** A two-sample t-test confirmed that the 2023 data is significantly better than the 2022 data (p-value < 0.05).

## Factors Impacting Telomere Length: Diet Analysis

### Calorie Intake

*   **Methodology:** Average daily calorie intake tracked from the previous test date to the day before the most recent test.
*   **Correlation with Telomere Length:** Calorie intake is inversely associated with telomere length.
    *   Higher average daily calorie intake correlates with shorter telomere length.
    *   Lower average daily calorie intake correlates with longer telomere length.

### Diet Composition: Macro and Micronutrients

*   **Initial Analysis (p-value < 0.05):** Approximately 40 macros and micros were compared.
    *   Potential for false positives: With 40 comparisons, at least two could be false positives (5 per 100 comparisons).
*   **False Discovery Rate (FDR) Adjustment:** Only four nutrients remained statistically significant (p < 0.05 and FDR < 0.05).
    *   **Positively Correlated with Longer Telomeres:**
        *   Omega-3 intake
        *   Vitamin B1 intake
    *   **Inversely Correlated with Shorter Telomeres:**
        *   Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio (higher ratio correlated with shorter telomeres)
        *   Copper intake (higher intake correlated with shorter telomeres)
*   **Note:** The direction of correlation varied among these significant nutrients.

### Diet Composition: Foods

*   **Initial Analysis (p-value < 0.05):** Approximately 50 different foods were analyzed.
    *   Potential for false positives: Two to three could be false positives.
*   **FDR Adjustment:** Three foods remained statistically significant.
    *   **Positively Correlated with Longer Telomeres:**
        *   Flaxseed (higher intake correlated with longer telomeres)
    *   **Inversely Correlated with Shorter Telomeres:**
        *   Parmesan cheese (higher intake correlated with shorter telomeres)
        *   Cocoa beans/cacao (higher intake correlated with shorter telomeres)

## Multivariate Analysis (Adjusting for Calorie Intake)

*   **Purpose:** To assess if correlations with diet components remain significant after accounting for calorie intake.

### Foods Adjusted for Calorie Intake

*   **Parmesan Cheese:** Higher intake remains significantly associated with shorter telomere length after adjusting for calorie intake.
*   **Cacao Beans:** Higher intake remains significantly associated with shorter telomere length after adjusting for calorie intake.
*   **Flaxseed:** Higher intake remains significantly associated with longer telomere length after adjusting for calorie intake.

### Macros/Micros Adjusted for Calorie Intake

*   **Omega-3, Omega-6 to Omega-3 Ratio, Vitamin B1, Copper:** None of these four nutrients remained statistically significant after adjusting for calorie intake.

## Future Plans

*   **Dietary Intervention:**
    *   Reduce intake of Parmesan cheese.
    *   Reduce intake of cacao beans.
    *   Increase intake of flaxseeds.
*   **Next Measurement:** Test number six, planned for October 2023, will assess the impact of these dietary changes.
