# 2021-07-09 Use Of Machine Learning In Longevity Science - A Conversation With Dr. Michael Rose Part II

**Executive Summary:**
*   Machine learning (ML) is essential to navigate the inherent complexity of aging and interventions, as reductionist approaches are inadequate for chronic, complex disorders.
*   Even single-substance interventions have complicated effects, necessitating ML tools for proper characterization of supplements and pharmaceuticals.
*   Dr. Rose, who previously considered it, now believes direct individual access to ML tools for personalized supplement recommendations is unfeasible, requiring vast corporate resources.
*   An integrated healthcare model is proposed where ML-driven omic research companies collaborate with pharmaceutical companies and major healthcare providers to deliver advanced, personalized medicine.
*   As an intermediate, short-term strategy, Dr. Rose suggests focusing on the age and ancestry-appropriate tuning of diet and lifestyle.

The challenge is to go from machine learning characterization of the omics of extreme longevity (e.g., in Drosophila and future human studies) to actionable interventions that significantly increase lifespan. The current reductionist scientific era often restricts studies to single supplements, making multi-ingredient formulations difficult to get accepted.

## Complexity of Longevity Interventions
An intermediate step available in this decade involves using machine learning tools to properly characterize the effects of supplements and pharmaceuticals. There is no simplicity in interventions, even with a single substance, as their effects are always complicated, similar to the effects observed in experimental evolution. Evidence for this complexity has accumulated over the past two decades with advanced genomic tools.

## Limitations of Reductionist Biology
Historically, biology often avoided mathematics, except for fields like evolution and quantitative genetics. In the 20th century, reductionist biology excelled at simple experiments that yielded interpretable results, particularly for genetic diseases characterized by one or a few major, highly dysfunctional pathways. However, this approach fails when addressing the chronic aging-associated disorders and aging itself, which involve immense complexity.

## Machine Learning as the Path Forward
The advent of genomics at the turn of the 21st century profoundly altered the landscape for reductionists, demonstrating the complexity of biological systems beyond simple genetic diseases or pathogen responses. This has rendered traditional reductionist approaches scientifically and technologically obsolete for understanding complex phenomena like aging.
Despite resistance from some quarters, new genomic and transcriptomic publications consistently reveal this complexity, pushing the scientific community, including researchers like Dr. Michael Rose and Alex Chavarenko, to adopt machine learning tools to parse this complexity and identify new directions. This is where the future of biological discovery lies.

## Personalized Machine Learning for Interventions
Even with a machine learning-based approach applied to large studies (thousands or hundreds of thousands of people) to identify parameters for extending health and lifespan within a cohort, a critical challenge remains for the individual. People would still need a personalized machine learning approach, using computational tools, to predict whether findings from large studies would be effective for *them* based on their unique genetics and environment. Without this personalized layer, simply adopting population-level recommendations could potentially do more harm than good.

Machine learning interactions are already commonplace in daily life; individuals routinely interface with vast databases and powerful ML tools when using services like Google search or Amazon. The extension of these tools into biology is a natural progression, even if it meets resistance from some professional biologists trained before 2000 who were not exposed to quantitative genetics tools that underpin much of modern genomics (e.g., GWAS analytics). The future of biological and other technologies will be dominated by machine learning.

However, Dr. Rose cautions against individual self-medication based on small-scale, potentially flawed studies (e.g., a supplement tested on 12 inbred mice versus 8 controls). Such interventions have not shown substantial benefits and can carry risks.

## Evolving Views on Individual ML Interfaces
Dr. Rose recounted proposing, approximately ten years prior, an online interface for individuals to use machine learning to get personalized supplement recommendations based on omic data. However, with a decade of additional research and experience in machine learning, he no longer believes this direct individual interface is a viable good idea. He now understands that accurately transitioning from omic data to personalized supplement or pharmaceutical recommendations requires substantial corporate resources and expertise.

He views the current use of pharmaceuticals for aging-associated diseases as suboptimal due to the insufficient utilization of readily available genomic and transcriptomic information from patients. This area represents a crucial growth opportunity in medicine.

## Integrated Healthcare Model for Longevity
Dr. Rose's updated perspective is that the pathway for machine learning integration in longevity science is not direct from omic research companies to individuals. Instead, it involves a complex, integrated ecosystem:

Omic Research Companies (ML-aided)
-> Pharmaceutical Companies (Big or Moderate)
-> Major Healthcare Providers (e.g., NHS, Kaiser Permanente)
-> Biomedical Scientists (within healthcare providers) interacting with:
    *   Pharma Companies
    *   Big Omic Databases
    *   AI Servers
-> Personalized Medicine/Interventions

This collaborative arc of technologies will take significant time to develop. The questioner acknowledged the time required and raised concerns about the interpretation of ML outputs, the potential for multiple effective pathways, and the challenges of trusting a centralized healthcare system, particularly within a dysfunctional system, where individuals might not have direct control over their own data analysis and interpretation. The questioner expressed a preference for personal control over analysis and decision-making.

## Short-Term Bridge to Longevity
As a more immediate and accessible approach, Dr. Rose suggests focusing on the **age and ancestry-appropriate tuning of diet and lifestyle**. This serves as a practical short-term bridge while the more complex integrated machine learning-driven healthcare models are developed.
