# 2025-11-23 If We Escape All Major Diseases Neurodegeneration And Respiratory Failure Is Likely

## Executive Summary

*   Supercentenarian deaths, even without major age-related diseases, may be linked to respiratory failure due to age-related motor unit and phrenic motor neuron loss, leading to diaphragm muscle decay and reduced function.
*   Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) shares mechanisms with hallmarks of aging, and respiratory failure is the primary cause of death in ALS patients.
*   Neurofilament light chain (NFL), a biomarker of axonal injury and neurodegeneration, significantly increases with age in healthy individuals; extrapolated levels in supercentenarians (100+ years) could reach concentrations typically observed in ALS patients.
*   Specific diacylglycerides (DAGs), elevated 6-18 times in ALS patients compared to controls, strongly correlate with circulating NFL levels, suggesting a potential indirect biomarker for tracking neurodegeneration.
*   Tracking and potentially optimizing these ALS-associated DAGs, along with exercise training, may offer strategies to mitigate age-related neurodegeneration and preserve respiratory function in those pursuing extreme longevity.

## Supercentenarian Longevity and Cause of Death

Maria Brañas Morera lived to 117 years old, nearing the longevity world record of 122 years. She reportedly escaped major age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. This raises the question of her cause of death. A proposed hypothesis, also championed by Tony at the I'm Longevity channel, suggests death may involve respiratory failure due to a loss of motor units in the diaphragm.

## Motor Unit Loss and Respiratory Failure in Aging

Motor units are crucial for muscle contraction; their loss leads to sarcopenia, the age-related decline in muscle mass and function.

Motor unit numbers, when plotted against age from birth to approximately 100 years, are approximately stable until around 55 years old, after which there is a steep decline until 100 years old. Without motor units signaling muscles to contract, muscles decay.

The signal for muscle contraction follows a pathway:
Brain (Upper Motor Neurons)
-> Spinal Cord (Lower Motor Neurons)
-> Skeletal Muscle
-> Muscle Contraction

The diaphragm, a skeletal muscle attached to the rib cage, is the main muscle of inspiration. It is innervated by phrenic nerves originating from the spinal cord.

*   **Phrenic Motor Neuron Decline:** Phrenic motor neuron numbers decline during aging. Studies in rats show older rats have significantly lower levels of phrenic motor neurons compared to young rats.
*   **Diaphragm Muscle Mass Decline:** Diaphragm muscle mass, measured as mean cross-sectional area in mice (young: 6 months; old: 24 months), shows a significant reduction in older mice, specifically in the Type 2X/2B fast-twitch muscle fibers. While a trend for lower levels was observed in Type 1 and Type 2A fibers, these were not statistically significant.
*   **Diaphragm Muscle Function Decline:** Diaphragm muscle function, measured as specific force (force production normalized to muscle cross-sectional area), declines during aging. In both isometric (no movement) and tetanic (movement) force production tests, diaphragms from older mice (24 months old) showed significantly reduced force production relative to young mice.

These data suggest that diaphragm motor unit loss, leading to reduced diaphragm muscle mass and function, could contribute to respiratory failure and be a cause of death in supercentenarians.

## Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Aging

If individuals escape all major age-related diseases, neurodegeneration and respiratory failure may become a likely cause of death for the general population. Stephen Hawking, for example, lived with ALS for about 55 years, an exceptionally long duration for a generally rapid neurodegenerative process.

While the lifetime probability of contracting ALS is relatively low (1 in 347 men, 1 in 436 women), making it not an obvious age-related disease on its surface, many ALS mechanisms overlap with the hallmarks of aging:
*   Disruption of proteostasis
*   Mitochondrial dysfunction
*   Oxidative stress
*   Neuroinflammation

Respiratory failure is the top cause of death in ALS, surpassing other causes like cancer, type 2 diabetes, or cardiovascular events.

## Neurofilament Light Chain (NFL) as an Aging Biomarker

Neurofilament light chain (NFL) is a biomarker of axonal injury, an event that precedes neurodegeneration. When an axon is injured, neurofilaments are released and can be detected in the blood.

*   **NFL in ALS:** Serum levels of NFL are approximately twofold higher in ALS patients (average 40 picograms per mL) compared to controls (average 20 picograms per mL). The highest observed NFL levels in ALS patients can reach around 110 picograms per mL.
*   **NFL Increases with Aging:**
    *   **Study 1 (Age range up to 65 years):** Serum NFL levels increase with aging. In a study of generally healthy, non-ALS individuals, median NFL levels showed an age-related increase. In young people, NFL levels were generally low, with the upper range around 8 picograms per mL. In 65-year-olds, the highest levels reached approximately 25 picograms per mL, with a median of 10 picograms per mL.
        *   **Extrapolation for extreme longevity (speculative):** Using a linear regression equation from this study (trained on ages 20-65 years), predicted average NFL levels:
            *   For a 106-year-old: 40 picograms per mL (equivalent to the average ALS value).
            *   For a 148-year-old: 110 picograms per mL (close to the highest value found in ALS patients).
    *   **Study 2 (Age range up to 85 years):** This study also shows that NFL levels increase with age, with average values in 85-year-olds reaching approximately 25 picograms per mL.
        *   **Extrapolation for extreme longevity (speculative):** Using a regression equation from this study (trained on ages 20-85 years), predicted average NFL levels:
            *   For a 104-year-old: 40 picograms per mL (equivalent to the average ALS value).
            *   For a 135-year-old: 110 picograms per mL (equivalent to the highest value found in ALS patients).

These extrapolations, while speculative, suggest that even without an ALS diagnosis, if individuals escape all major diseases, increasing neurodegeneration (indicated by NFL) and subsequent respiratory failure may be a likely cause of death for those pursuing extreme longevity.

## Tracking Neurodegeneration: NFL and Diacylglycerides

Directly tracking NFL is possible but expensive. An alternative strategy involves tracking biomarkers correlated with NFL.

*   **Diacylglycerides (DAGs):** These are lipid molecules with a glycerol backbone bound to two fatty acids. Diacylglycerides have been shown to be significantly associated with circulating levels of NFL, particularly in ALS patients.
    *   The strongest association was observed for diacylglyceride 18:1 18:1 (containing oleic acid). Higher levels of this DAG were significantly correlated with higher levels of NFL in ALS patients, and lower levels corresponded to lower NFL. This is a correlation, not causation.
    *   Seven specific diacylglyceride species were identified as significantly higher in ALS patients compared to healthy controls (adjusted P < 0.05). Their log2-fold change values ranged from 2.62 to 4.2, indicating they were 6 to 18 times higher in ALS patients.
*   **Tracking DAGs:** Four of these seven ALS-associated diacylglycerides, including the 18:1 18:1 species with the strongest NFL correlation, can be tracked using metabolomics kits.
    *   Tracking the sum of these four DAGs year-to-year can help monitor trends. Lower levels are generally considered better, especially given their association with higher NFL and increased all-cause mortality risk.

## Interventions and Future Biomarkers

*   **Exercise Training:** Regular exercise is expected to maintain motor units or slow their age-related loss, thereby potentially mitigating neurodegeneration, lowering circulating NFL levels, and potentially reducing diacylglyceride levels.
*   **Other Biomarkers:** Beyond NFL, other biomarkers linked to neurodegeneration that can be tracked include:
    *   Cystatin C
    *   Kynurenine divided by tryptophan ratio
    *   Acylcarnitines
