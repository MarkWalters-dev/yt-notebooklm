# 2025-03-27 Traits That Predict Lifespan - Gary Churchill PhD Clip

## Executive Summary
*   Pheno delta (a calculated trait) demonstrated the strongest positive correlation with very long lifespan in mice.
*   Red cell distribution width (RDW) measured at 10 months of age was the trait most strongly associated with shorter lifespan.
*   Maintenance of body fat reserves is positively associated with increased lifespan, particularly when mice are on restrictive diets.
*   Immune cell populations, specifically myeloid and lymphoid counts, are among the traits that correlate with longevity outcomes.

## Mouse Data Analysis Methodology
Researchers at the Jackson Laboratory conducted extensive phenotyping across the lifespan of mice, measuring hundreds of individual traits over multiple time points (e.g., three or six time points).

*   **Data Collection:** Over 700 individual measurements were taken per mouse, in addition to weekly body weight measurements, resulting in thousands of data points per individual animal.
*   **Analysis Goal:** To calculate the diet-adjusted lifespan correlation for all measured traits, identifying which traits were associated with longer lifespan and which were associated with shorter lifespan.

## Key Correlating Traits

### Traits Associated with Longer Lifespan
*   **Pheno Delta:** This calculated trait exhibited the strongest correlation with very long lifespan among all measured parameters.
*   **Fat Maintenance:** The ability of mice to maintain body fat, especially while on restrictive diets, showed a positive association with lifespan.

### Traits Associated with Shorter Lifespan
*   **Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW):** RDW measured at 10 months of age was the trait most strongly associated with a shorter lifespan.

### Immune System Correlates
*   Myeloid and lymphoid cell populations (immune traits) showed measurable associations with lifespan outcomes.

**Metabolic/Fat Maintenance Pathway:**
$$\text{Restrictive Diet} \rightarrow \text{Challenge to Maintain Mass} \rightarrow \text{Maintaining Fat Reserves} \rightarrow \text{Positive Lifespan Association}$$
