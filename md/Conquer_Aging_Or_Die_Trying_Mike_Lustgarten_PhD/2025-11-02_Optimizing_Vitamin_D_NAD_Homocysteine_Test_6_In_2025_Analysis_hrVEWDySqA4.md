# 2025-11-02 Optimizing Vitamin D NAD Homocysteine Test 6 In 2025 Analysis

### Executive Summary

*   **Biological Age:** FenoAge calculated the biological age as 17 years younger than the chronological age.
*   **Vitamin D:** Circulating 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels reached 53 ng/mL after discontinuing supplementation and relying solely on 20 minutes/day of full-body sun exposure. Meta-analyses suggest optimal levels are greater than 30 ng/mL.
*   **NAD Levels:** Supplementing with nicotinamide (464 mg/day) resulted in an NAD level of 21.2 micromolar, a modest increase of about 6 micromolar from a previous test. This was significantly less effective than nicotinic acid or NMN at raising NAD.
*   **Homocysteine:** Current homocysteine levels are 8.8 micromolar, which is above the personal target of <5 micromolar and represents a consistent challenge despite efforts to mitigate age-related increases.
*   **Homocysteine Strategy:** Investigating the combination of betaine (1.4 g/day) with zinc (15 mg/day) to enhance BHMT activity, alongside existing methyl B12, methyl folate, and riboflavin supplementation. Past attempts with high-dose betaine or serine were ineffective without zinc.

## Biological Age

Biological age (FenoAge) was calculated as 17 years younger than chronological age for blood test number six in 2025.

## Prescription Medications

*   Levothyroxine (T4): 75 micrograms per day
*   Cytomel (T3): 20 micrograms per day
*   No other prescription medications (e.g., rapamycin).

## Vitamin D Optimization

*   **Previous Supplementation:** 1,000-2,000 IUs/day of supplemental vitamin D for at least nine months out of the year while living in the Northeast U.S.
*   **Current Protocol (Texas):** Supplemental vitamin D was completely removed.
    *   Intentional full-body sun exposure: 20 minutes per day, front and back.
*   **Current Circulating Level (25-hydroxy vitamin D):** 53 ng/mL.
*   **Optimal Range Considerations:**
    *   The lab's reference range is 30 to 100 ng/mL, with an "optimal" recommendation of greater than 30 ng/mL.
    *   Based on meta-analyses of published literature, greater than 30 ng/mL is generally considered optimal, aligning with the lab's recommendation, despite some individual studies suggesting benefits at higher levels.
*   **Future Research:** Vitamin D levels will be measured for at least the next five tests (through winter and early summer) to assess levels without supplementation and conduct biomarker-versus-biomarker analysis to personalize the optimal level.

## NAD Precursor Efficacy (Nicotinamide vs. Others)

*   **Goal:** Increase NAD levels using nicotinamide alone.
*   **Nicotinamide Supplementation Protocol:**
    *   Average dose: 464 mg/day of nicotinamide.
    *   Duration: July 31st through September 15th (part of the dietary period from Test 5 to Test 6).
    *   Rationale for timing: Initiated after receiving NAD test results from July 22nd to strategize for Test 6.
*   **NAD Testing:** Blood sent to Jinfiniti for NAD level measurement.
*   **Current NAD Level (Test 6):** 21.2 micromolar.
*   **Optimal Range Considerations:** This level is generally considered low. Values greater than 40 micromolar and up to 100 micromolar are often considered optimal. The personal optimal range is still being determined through biomarker-versus-biomarker analysis.
*   **Comparison of NAD Precursors (based on 30 tests over a three-year span):**
    *   **Nicotinic Acid (NA):**
        *   ~300 mg/day: Increased NAD to 60-67 micromolar (approximately 3x higher than nicotinamide at a lower dose).
        *   100 mg/day: Increased NAD to 42-48 micromolar.
    *   **NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide):**
        *   2 grams/day: Increased NAD to 61 micromolar.
        *   1,000 mg/day: Increased NAD to 39 micromolar.
        *   300 mg/day: Increased NAD to 25 micromolar.
    *   **Nicotinamide (NAm):**
        *   ~464 mg/day: Increased NAD to 21.2 micromolar.
*   **Conclusion on Nicotinamide Effectiveness:**
    *   Nicotinic acid appears to be more effective than nicotinamide for raising NAD.
    *   500 mg/day of nicotinamide was slightly less effective than 300 mg/day of NMN.
    *   A modest NAD increase of about 6 micromolar was observed (from 15 micromolar to 21 micromolar compared to the prior test), indicating nicotinamide may not be entirely ineffective but results in significantly lower levels compared to other precursors.

## Homocysteine Reduction Strategy

*   **Importance of Homocysteine:**
    *   Cardiovascular disease risk biomarker.
    *   Neurotoxic.
    *   Accelerates endothelial cell senescence.
*   **Current Homocysteine Level (Test 6):** 8.8 micromolar.
*   **Reference Range:** Less than 15.2 micromolar.
*   **Personal Optimal Target:** Less than 5 micromolar (a strict interpretation of literature to maximally reduce the risk of all-cause mortality).
*   **Historical Trend (49 tests over 20 years):**
    *   Initial period (average of six tests): 7.1 micromolar, with two tests close to 5 micromolar.
    *   Recent period (43 tests over the past seven years): Average increased to 10.3 micromolar. This indicates a failure to resist the age-related increase in homocysteine and a consistent inability to reach the 5 micromolar target. The current 8.8 micromolar is close to the lowest in the past two years but still above the target.
*   **Homocysteine Metabolism (Folate/B12 Pathway):**
    `Dietary Folic Acid -> (MTHFR gene, requires FAD/Riboflavin) -> Serum Folate`
    `Homocysteine + Serum Folate + Vitamin B12 -> (Methionine Synthase) -> Methionine`
*   **Current Supplementation Protocols (Folate/B12 Pathway):**
    *   **Riboflavin (Vitamin B2):**
        *   Protocol: Titrating upwards, currently at 9 mg/day, aiming closer to 30 mg/day (maximal small intestine absorption).
        *   Preparation: Self-made stock solution by dissolving 100 mg of 400 mg capsules in 1 liter of water (riboflavin's water solubility limit).
        *   Rationale: Riboflavin is essential for FAD synthesis, which is a cofactor for MTHFR activity, supporting the conversion of folic acid to serum folate.
    *   **Methyl B12, Methyl Folate, Vitamin B6:**
        *   Protocol: One daily pill containing 1,000 micrograms methyl B12, 400 micrograms methyl folate, and 1.5 mg vitamin B6.
        *   Rationale: These directly support the methionine synthase enzyme, which converts homocysteine to methionine.
        *   Effect: Vitamin B12 shows a significant correlation with lower homocysteine, but only an estimated 10% effect.
*   **Homocysteine Metabolism (Betaine Pathway):**
    `Homocysteine + Betaine -> (BHMT, requires Zinc) -> Methionine + Dimethylglycine`
*   **Current Supplementation Protocols (Betaine/Zinc):**
    *   **Past Attempts with Betaine:** High-dose betaine (4 grams/day) alone did not reduce homocysteine.
    *   **Current Protocol:**
        *   Betaine: Average 1.4 grams/day (from a stock solution).
        *   Zinc: 15 mg/day.
        *   Rationale: Zinc is a required cofactor for BHMT (Betaine-Homocysteine Methyltransferase) activity. Previous betaine failures may have been due to insufficient zinc levels, as dietary zinc intake was historically near the RDA.
*   **Serine + Vitamin B6 Pathway:**
    `Homocysteine + Serine + Vitamin B6 -> Cystathionine`
    *   **Past Attempts:** High-dose serine (up to 6 grams/day) combined with vitamin B6 did not reduce homocysteine.
*   **Future Plans (Test 7 Strategy for Homocysteine):**
    *   The B12 and folate supplementation will be removed for the next test.
    *   Betaine will be increased to 5-6 grams/day.
    *   Zinc supplementation will continue.
    *   This aims to isolate the effect of the betaine/zinc pathway on homocysteine reduction.
