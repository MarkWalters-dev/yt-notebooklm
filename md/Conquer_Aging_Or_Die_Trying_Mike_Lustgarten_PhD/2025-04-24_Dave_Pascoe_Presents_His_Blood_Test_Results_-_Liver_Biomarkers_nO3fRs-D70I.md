# 2025-04-24 Dave Pascoe Presents His Blood Test Results - Liver Biomarkers

**Executive Summary:**
*   Albumin, a highly concentrated blood protein, shows an optimal trend for Dave Pascoe, improving during aging, suggesting good liver health.
*   Bilirubin levels for Dave have decreased, which is interpreted as a positive indicator, suggesting a reduction in previous oxidative stress, despite centenarians often showing higher compensatory levels.
*   Liver transaminases (ALT and AST) have shown a positive trend towards lower, healthier levels, though AST remains somewhat elevated.
*   Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is identified as a superior marker for liver disease mortality risk; Dave's low GGT levels (below 12 U/L) indicate excellent liver health.
*   Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) levels, while previously low, have been trending upwards for Dave in recent years, moving in an unfavorable direction, possibly influenced by supplementation, exercise, or hormone regulation.

## Albumin
Albumin serves as a primary marker of liver health and function. Its concentration typically declines during aging, but Dave Pascoe's values, currently around 4.5 grams per deciliter (4,500 milligrams per deciliter), demonstrate an optimal trend, moving in the desired direction.

Albumin is considered an underrated biomarker due to its high concentration in the blood. For context:
*   Albumin: 4,500 mg/dL
*   Glucose (typical best): 80 mg/dL
*   Total Cholesterol (typical): 200 mg/dL

Based purely on concentration, albumin is approximately 56 times higher than glucose and 22.5 times higher than total cholesterol. Although it is a large protein, its significant concentration makes it a critical component of blood. Maintaining relatively high albumin levels and preventing age-related decline is considered a top-tier indicator of health.

## Bilirubin
Bilirubin levels are generally stable with aging, but Dave's data shows a decline. The interpretation of bilirubin is nuanced: lower levels are typically found in youth and tend to increase with aging. Notably, centenarians often exhibit relatively higher bilirubin levels, sometimes double Dave's current values.

Bilirubin can function as an antioxidant. In centenarians, higher levels are often a compensatory mechanism, particularly when their intrinsic antioxidant defense enzymes are compromised. This process can be visualized as:

Impaired Antioxidant Defense Enzymes -> Compensatory Mechanism -> Red Blood Cell Degradation -> Hemoglobin Degradation -> Increased Bilirubin (acting as an antioxidant)

In general, lower bilirubin levels are considered more favorable, with the aim to maintain them low and avoid the age-related increase. Dave's decrease is a positive development, suggesting a reduction in previous oxidative stress, as historically very high bilirubin levels could indicate such stress. Specifically, Dave's bilirubin decreased from the 1.7-2.0 U/L range in 2020 to 0.9 U/L by November 2020, consistently remaining lower thereafter.

## Liver Enzymes: AST, ALT, and GGT

### ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)
Dave's ALT levels are trending in a positive direction. Values in the high teens to low twenties are associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk.

### AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)
Dave's AST levels are also moving in the right direction, showing improvement from previously elevated ranges into the normal reference range. However, his most recent tests indicate values in the low to mid-thirties, which are still relatively high. Elevated AST can suggest a trigger for liver damage, with supplements being a potential factor.

### GGT (Gamma-glutamyl transferase)
A study comparing GGT against AST and ALT for liver disease-related mortality found GGT to be a more significant predictor. The highest 10% of GGT levels were associated with an eightfold higher risk of death from liver disease mortality, whereas the highest AST and ALT levels correlated with a fourfold higher risk. For GGT, levels less than 12 U/L are associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk, based on a large study of 16 million people. Dave's GGT data is consistently low and considered excellent, suggesting robust liver health, despite some lingering elevation in AST. Dave has been experimenting with Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), which is involved with cholestasis and may be contributing to these values.

## Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)
Studies on ALP and its association with aging are variable; levels generally remain flat, and large epidemiological studies are lacking for a definitive assessment of age-related changes. All-cause mortality risk is associated with ALP levels above 48 U/L.

Dave's ALP levels are moving in an unfavorable direction, increasing over time, although they are not far from the optimal range. Historically, Dave recorded remarkably low ALP levels (30-32 U/L), which is uncommon. The trend shows fluctuations: a period of very low levels around late 2020/early 2021, followed by a sustained increase through 2022-2024, and then a recent decrease in 2025.

## Potential Influencing Factors
Several factors are considered potential drivers for the observed changes in Dave's liver biomarkers:

*   **Supplementation:** Dave's life involves significant experimentation with various supplements. Periods of adding or removing specific supplements are considered a likely cause for fluctuations in liver biomarkers. Detailed tracking of supplement intake alongside test results could help pinpoint specific impacts.
*   **Marathon Training Volume:** High training volumes, such as those associated with marathon preparation, could potentially affect some biomarkers positively and others negatively. Correlating average daily heart rate data (e.g., from wearable devices like Whoop) from periods between tests with biomarker changes could help identify optimal training volumes.
*   **Dietary Changes:** Prior to 2020, Dave's diet was less controlled. Following 2020, he adopted cleaner eating practices, including grass-fed meats, and became more intentional with his supplementation. This shift is linked to initial improvements in some biomarkers.
*   **Hormone Regulation:** During periods of biomarker fluctuation (e.g., ALP increases post-2022), Dave was actively working on balancing his hormones, including adjustments to thyroid medication. These hormone-related interventions are acknowledged as confounding variables that could influence liver enzyme levels.
