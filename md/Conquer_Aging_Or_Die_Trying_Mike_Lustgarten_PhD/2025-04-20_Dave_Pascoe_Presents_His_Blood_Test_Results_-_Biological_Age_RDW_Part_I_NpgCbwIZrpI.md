# 2025-04-20 Dave Pascoe Presents His Blood Test Results - Biological Age RDW Part I

## Executive Summary

*   **PhenoAge Trajectory:** Dave Pascoe’s PhenoAge shows stability, tracking approximately 10 years younger than his chronological age since 2021, suggesting a successful slowing of the rate of aging despite natural annual increases in PhenoAge driven by chronological age.
*   **RDW Improvement:** Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) shows a significant, non-intentional downward trend between 2021 and 2023, moving from an average near 13.5 down toward the optimal range, which the speaker hypothesizes is a side effect of other health interventions.
*   **Data Consistency:** The analysis benefits from high data density, with approximately 11-12 blood tests performed monthly, providing a robust view of year-to-year changes compared to less frequent testing.
*   **Standardization Need:** The subject identified a lack of standardization in testing protocols (fasting window, pre-test hydration, and exercise timing), indicating a need for refinement to minimize variability in biomarker results.
*   **Optimal RDW Range:** The discussion highlighted that RDW optimal ranges are highly specific, with one reference range cited as 11.6 to 15.4 (LabCorp), while the perceived optimal for longevity analysis is narrower (e.g., 11.4 to 12.6).

## Biological Age Metrics (PhenoAge)

The analysis of Dave Pascoe's biological age metrics across multiple tests (approximately 12 per year) shows a generally stable trend relative to chronological age.

*   Since 2021, the PhenoAge has consistently tracked about 10 years younger than the chronological age.
*   The expected annual increase in PhenoAge (0.9 years per chronological year) has been successfully resisted, keeping the age estimate low (e.g., 48.65 in 2025 vs. expected 51-52).
*   **Period of Fluctuation (2024):** A noticeable spike in biological age indicators occurred from May through the end of 2024. The speaker attributed this increase to high stress related to home remodeling and filming for a documentary, followed by contracting COVID-19 in October, with results returning to baseline levels after the New Year.

## Testing Protocol and Data Integrity

A key area of focus was the necessity of standardizing blood test procedures to ensure data accuracy and comparability over time.

### Standardization Gaps Identified:

*   **Fasting Window:** Fasting duration varied (8 to 16 hours previously), introducing potential variability into results, as the diet composition the day prior was also inconsistent.
*   **Hydration:** Tests were sometimes taken immediately upon waking after driving, leading to potential dehydration. The speaker intends to standardize intake to approximately two cups of water beforehand to ensure better blood flow without causing rapid urination before the test.
*   **Exercise Timing:** There was no strict rule regarding the last workout relative to test time, although the current plan is to avoid exercise the day immediately preceding a test.

### Recommendation for Standardization:
The speaker plans to adopt a standardized pre-test routine, including fixing the fasting window and establishing a specific, consistent meal to be consumed the day before testing.

## RDW (Red Blood Cell Distribution Width) Deep Dive

RDW is highlighted as the largest predictor of the PhenoAge score.

### RDW Trends:

*   **Visual Trend:** The trend line for RDW is predominantly shown in red, indicating a mild upward trend (in the direction of aging). However, a significant period between 2021 and 2023 showed a strong downward trajectory, suggesting improvement, before recent results slightly moved upward again in early 2025.
*   **Optimal Range Discrepancy:**
    *   LabCorp reference range: 11.6 to 15.4.
    *   Speaker's self-determined optimal range: 8.1 to 12.5 (though the rationale for this specific setting was unclear in the data review).
    *   The presenter's preferred optimal range, based on all-cause mortality risk data, is **11.4 to 12.6**. It is noted that RDW values significantly below 11.4 also show an increase in all-cause mortality risk, though this is rare.
*   **Current Status:** The subject’s average RDW appears to be around 13.2, with recent 2025 results clustering between 12.4 and 12.9.

### Investigating the Downward Shift (2021–2023):

Despite RDW typically increasing with age, the subject experienced a substantial decrease in this marker across numerous tests during the 2021–2023 period. The subject was not intentionally targeting RDW through supplements or specific lifestyle changes during that time, suggesting the improvement was an unintended side effect of other ongoing protocols. This shift is considered highly significant for longevity given the marker’s strong association with aging.
