# 2024-01-24 Did High-Dose NMN Mess Up The Epigenetic Pace Of Aging

## Executive Summary

*   High-dose nicotinic acid (600 mg/day) correlated with a worse epigenetic pace of aging score (0.98).
*   High-dose NMN (2000 mg/day) did not negatively impact the epigenetic pace of aging, with a score of 0.74.
*   The study suggests that a high NAD+ level achieved via nicotinic acid, rather than just a high NAD+ level itself, might be detrimental to the epigenetic pace of aging.
*   High-dose NMN supplementation coincided with a potentially lower estimated telomere length.

## Background and Methodology

The study investigates the impact of high doses of nicotinic acid and NMN on NAD+ levels and the epigenetic pace of aging, as well as telomere length.

### Experiment 1: High-Dose Nicotinic Acid

*   **Intervention:** Supplementation with 600 mg of nicotinic acid per day.
*   **NAD+ Measurement:** Blood samples sent to Genfinity for NAD+ analysis.
    *   Result: NAD+ levels increased to 67.4 micromolar (2-3 times baseline of 20-25 micromolar).
*   **Epigenetic Pace of Aging Measurement:** Blood samples sent to True Diagnostic for epigenetic analysis.
    *   Result (on the same day as NAD+ test): Dunedin Pace score of 0.98, the worst score over 11 tests.

### Experiment 2: High-Dose NMN

*   **Intervention:** Supplementation with 2 grams (2000 mg) of NMN per day.
*   **NAD+ Measurement:** Blood samples sent to Genfinity for NAD+ analysis.
    *   Result: NAD+ levels increased to 61 micromolar.
*   **Epigenetic Pace of Aging Measurement:** Blood samples sent to True Diagnostic for epigenetic analysis.
    *   Result (on the same day as NAD+ test): Dunedin Pace score of 0.74, the lowest score over 11 tests.
*   **Telomere Length Measurement:** Blood samples sent to True Diagnostic for DNA methylation estimation of telomere length.
    *   Result: Estimated telomere length of 7.06 kilobases. This is the lowest value recorded in 2023 and falls within the range of the three worst telomere length measurements.

## Key Findings and Interpretations

### Impact on Epigenetic Pace of Aging

*   **Nicotinic Acid:** High-dose nicotinic acid (600 mg/day) was associated with a significantly worse epigenetic pace of aging score (0.98).
*   **NMN:** High-dose NMN (2000 mg/day) did not negatively affect the epigenetic pace of aging, and in fact, resulted in the best score recorded (0.74).
*   **Conclusion:** The data suggests that the negative impact on the epigenetic pace of aging observed with high-dose nicotinic acid may be specific to that precursor, rather than solely due to achieving high NAD+ levels above 60 micromolar. This indicates a potential issue with high-dose nicotinic acid itself.

### Potential Impact on Telomere Length

*   **NMN and Telomere Length:** The estimated telomere length of 7.06 kilobases, recorded on the same day as high-dose NMN supplementation, is the lowest value observed in 2023 and is similar to previous worst scores.
*   **Uncertainty:** It is unclear whether this represents a true negative impact of high-dose NMN on telomere length or is simply random fluctuation.

## Current Strategy

*   **Discontinuation:** High-dose nicotinic acid and high-dose NMN have been discontinued.
*   **Current Approach:**
    *   Sporadic use of low-dose nicotinic acid (60 mg/day or less) on workout days.
    *   Experimentation with trichonyl (1-methylnicotinic acid) and fenugreek seeds (high in 1-methylnicotinate) in low doses to impact NAD+.
