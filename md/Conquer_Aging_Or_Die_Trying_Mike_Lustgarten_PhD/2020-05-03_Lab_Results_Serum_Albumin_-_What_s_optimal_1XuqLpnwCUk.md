# 2020-05-03 Lab Results Serum Albumin - What s optimal

### Executive Summary

*   Higher serum albumin levels are associated with biological youth and tend to decrease with age in both sexes.
*   Lower albumin levels are linked to an increased risk of all-cause mortality across different age groups.
*   Optimal albumin levels for the lowest risk of all-cause death are identified as greater than 45 grams per liter (g/L) for men and greater than 44 g/L for women.
*   Albumin levels can be significantly optimized through lifestyle interventions, particularly diet, even against age-related decline.
*   A strong correlation exists between higher dietary beta-carotene intake and elevated serum albumin levels.

## Albumin and Age

The typical reference range for albumin is 35 to 50 grams per liter (g/L). Higher albumin levels are associated with biological youth.

*   **Age Trend:** Albumin levels generally decrease with age for both sexes.
*   **Sex Differences:** Males tend to exhibit higher albumin levels than females until approximately 60-65 years of age.

## Albumin and All-Cause Mortality

A large study involving 1.7 million subjects investigated the relationship between albumin levels and all-cause mortality risk.

*   **Risk Trend:** As albumin levels decrease, the risk of all-cause death increases for both men and women across all age groups (less than 50, 50-69, and greater than 70 years old).
*   **Optimal Levels:**
    *   For men, albumin levels greater than 45 g/L are associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality.
    *   For women, albumin levels greater than 44 g/L are associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality.

## Optimizing Albumin Levels

Personal tracking demonstrates that albumin levels can be optimized and age-related decline resisted through consistent dietary and blood monitoring.

### Tracking Methodology:

*   **Initial Phase (10 years in 30s):** Blood tested approximately once a year.
    *   Average albumin: 47 g/L.
*   **Intensified Phase (From 2015, 5 years):** Dietary tracking and blood testing 4-6 times a year, yielding 23 data points.
    *   Albumin levels increased from an average of 47 g/L to 49.3 g/L. This increase was statistically significant.

## Dietary Correlations: Beta-Carotene

Analysis of dietary intake alongside albumin levels revealed a moderately strong positive correlation (approximately 0.6) between beta-carotene intake and albumin levels.

*   **Target Intake:** To potentially achieve albumin levels associated with biological youth (around 50 g/L), an estimated intake of 60,000 micrograms (or 60 milligrams) of beta-carotene daily is suggested based on observed correlations.
*   **Primary Dietary Sources of Beta-Carotene:**
    *   Carrots
    *   Orange sweet potatoes
    *   Red bell peppers
    *   Spinach
    *   Parsley
