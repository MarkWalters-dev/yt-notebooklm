# 2024-12-24 Red Light Starvation Is A Public Health Problem - Glen Jeffery PhD

## Executive Summary
*   Red light starvation in the modern built environment is emerging as a public health problem, analogous to historical scurvy.
*   Mitochondrial failure, implicated in degenerative diseases like dementia, is linked to light exposure, driving the mitochondrial theory of aging.
*   Astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) exhibit signs of pre-diabetes and accelerated aging, likely due to prolonged exposure to short-wavelength, hard white LED lighting.
*   Geographic areas, such as the Arabian Peninsula, show high diabetes peaks, potentially linked to people staying indoors due to climate, exacerbating lack of natural light coupled with infrared-blocking architectural glass.
*   The solution requires engineering glass filters that partially block infrared light to allow beneficial wavelengths to enter buildings while maintaining thermal control.

## Red Light Starvation as a Public Health Crisis

The modern built environment leads to a deficit of long-wavelength light, specifically red light. This deficiency is termed "modern scurvy" because, like Vitamin C deficiency, a necessary component for health is missing and can lead to serious consequences.

### Impact on Aging and Mitochondria

The lack of red light directly impacts aging because mitochondria regulate blood sugar and degenerative processes.
*   Mitochondrial failure is associated with dementia and memory problems.
*   The **Mitochondrial Theory of Aging**, established in the 1950s, posits that mitochondrial function dictates lifespan, a theory that has remained scientifically robust.
*   Increasing exposure to deep red light, often missing indoors, is necessary. This can be achieved by going outside during daylight hours.

## Observational Evidence of Light Imbalance

### International Space Station (ISS) Findings
NASA published a study indicating adverse health effects in astronauts aboard the ISS:
1.  Astronauts are developing pre-diabetic conditions.
2.  Astronauts are experiencing accelerated aging.
These observations are correlated with the environment on the ISS, which is lit predominantly by hard white LEDs (short-wavelength light) for months at a time.

### Geographic Correlation with Diabetes
Diabetes rates peak significantly in regions like the Arabian Peninsula. Contributing factors include:
*   Individuals staying indoors due to extreme heat and discomfort, thus avoiding natural light.
*   Modern architectural trends utilizing large amounts of glass that incorporates **infrared (IR) blocking technology**.

This combination—indoor confinement plus IR-blocking windows—reduces exposure to both natural light and essential long-wavelength infrared light, while artificial LEDs dominate the internal lighting spectrum.

## Architectural and Engineering Solutions

The construction of new, health-focused buildings (e.g., the Mayo Clinic project) is beginning to address light quality as a health mandate alongside air quality.

The challenge is balancing environmental control (temperature) with biological health requirements (light exposure).

**Goal for Healthy Building Design:**
Develop specialized glass filters that:
1.  Partially block the infrared spectrum.
2.  Allow sufficient beneficial light wavelengths to enter the building.
3.  Maintain necessary thermal control within the structure.

My current work focuses on public health, shifting from my background in visual science to address these environmental impacts.
