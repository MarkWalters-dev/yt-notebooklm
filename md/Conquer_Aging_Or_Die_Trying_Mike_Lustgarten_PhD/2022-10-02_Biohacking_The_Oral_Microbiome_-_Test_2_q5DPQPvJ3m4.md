# 2022-10-02 Biohacking The Oral Microbiome - Test 2

**Executive Summary**

*   Adding potassium nitrate to the mouthwash did not increase nitrate-reducing bacteria, likely because existing dietary nitrate intake (1700 mg/day) was already 6-7 times higher than the acceptable daily intake, potentially saturating oral nitrate levels.
*   Analysis of oral health-related bacteria showed mixed results: decreased gum inflammation and primary endodontic infection bacteria, but unchanged beneficial bacteria, largely unchanged bad breath bacteria, and an increase in periodontal disease-linked bacteria. Dental caries remained at 0%.
*   Oral bacteria linked to adverse systemic health conditions showed minor, mixed changes, with a small overall reduction in the sum of these bacteria (4.3% to 3.4%).
*   *Fusobacterium nucleatum* and *Tannerella forsythia* were consistently identified as major contributors to various adverse oral and systemic health-linked bacterial categories.
*   *In vitro* studies suggest that beta-caryophyllene (found in clove oil) and clove oil itself can inhibit the growth and kill *T. forsythia* and *F. nucleatum*, leading to a planned modification of the mouthwash for the next test.

## Initial Mouthwash Composition and Rationale

The homemade mouthwash is designed as a prebiotic for the oral microbiome. Its components and their intended effects are:

*   **Xylitol (11 grams):** Inhibits the growth of *Streptococcus mutans*, a bacterium linked to cavity formation.
*   **Sodium Bicarbonate (11 grams):** Alkalinizes the mouth. Cavities form at an acidic pH, so bicarbonate helps remove acid.
*   **Peppermint Oil (3 drops):** Limits the growth of *P. gingivalis*.
*   **Potassium Nitrate (4 grams):** A recent addition, expected to increase nitrate-reducing bacteria. This increase may limit the growth of bacteria linked with poor oral and systemic health, and enhance health-associated oral bacteria like *Neisseria* and *Rothia*, while decreasing bacteria related to halitosis, periodontal disease, and caries.
*   **Water (1 liter):** Vehicle for the mixture.

## Oral Microbiome Analysis: Test 2 Results

A saliva sample was analyzed to assess changes in salivary microbiome composition relative to Test 1.

### Nitrate Reducing Bacteria

Seven bacterial species with known nitrate-reducing ability constituted 53.1% of the total bacteria in Test 1. Despite the addition of potassium nitrate to the mouthwash, this percentage decreased to 46% in Test 2.

Considering a broader set of up to 30 known nitrate-reducing bacteria, the sum was 78% for Test 1 and decreased to approximately 69% for Test 2. This indicates that nitrate-reducing bacteria did not increase, regardless of the calculation method, despite 4 grams per liter of potassium nitrate in the mouthwash.

### Dietary Nitrate Intake

The lack of increase in nitrate-reducing bacteria might be attributed to an already high dietary nitrate intake, which could have saturated oral nitrate levels, thus limiting further growth.

An analysis of common nitrate-containing foods consumed daily over the week before Test 2 showed:

| Food Item        | Nitrate Content (mg/100g) | Average Daily Intake (g) | Daily Nitrate Intake (mg) |
| :--------------- | :------------------------ | :----------------------- | :------------------------ |
| Spinach          | 300                       | 200                      | 600                       |
| Beets            | 150                       | 300                      | 450                       |
| Arugula          | 450                       | 100                      | 450                       |
| Celery           | 250                       | 100                      | 250                       |
| **Total Daily Nitrate Intake** |                           |                          | **1700 mg**               |

The acceptable daily intake (ADI) for nitrate is reported as 3.7 mg of nitrate per kilogram of body weight per day. For a body weight of 69.1 kg, the ADI is 256 mg/day. The calculated daily intake of 1700 mg/day is 6-7 times higher than the ADI, supporting the hypothesis of already saturated oral nitrate levels.

### Oral Health-Related Bacteria

#### Beneficial Bacteria

Bristol's definition of beneficial bacteria includes *Neisseria mucosa* among others. The relative abundance of these bacteria was 21.4% in Test 1 and 21.1% in Test 2, showing no increase.

#### Gum Inflammation

Bacteria linked with gum inflammation decreased from 3.8% in Test 1 to 1.8% in Test 2. The majority of the 1.8% in Test 2 was attributed to *Fusobacterium nucleatum* and *Tannerella forsythia*, collectively accounting for 1.5%.

#### Bad Breath (Halitosis)

Bacteria related to halitosis showed a minor reduction, from 5.5% in Test 1 to 5.2% in Test 2. *Fusobacterium nucleatum* and *Tannerella forsythia* were again significant contributors, accounting for 1.5% of the 5.2%.

#### Tooth Decay (Dental Caries)

Bacteria related to dental caries remained at approximately 0% for both tests, which is a positive outcome.

#### Primary Endodontic Infection

Bacteria linked to primary endodontic infection (infection of the dental root) decreased from 2.9% in Test 1 to 1.7% in Test 2. *Fusobacterium nucleatum* and *Tannerella forsythia* contributed 1.5% of the 1.7%.

#### Periodontal Disease (General)

Bacteria related to periodontal disease increased from 0.7% in Test 1 to 1.2% in Test 2. *Tannerella forsythia* alone accounted for 0.8% of the 1.2%.

### Summary of Oral Health-Related Bacteria

The overall effect of the mouthwash on intra-oral conditions was largely neutral or mixed:

*   **Decreased:** Nitrate reducing bacteria (undesired), gum inflammation-related bacteria, primary endodontic infection-related bacteria.
*   **Unchanged:** Beneficial bacteria, dental caries-related bacteria.
*   **Increased:** Halitosis-related bacteria (minor), periodontal disease-related bacteria.

## Systemic Health-Linked Oral Bacteria

The analysis also looked at salivary bacteria linked with adverse health conditions outside the mouth.

*   **Plaque:** Reduced from 2.3% in Test 1 to 0.9% in Test 2. *Tannerella forsythia* accounted for 0.8% of the 0.9%.
*   **Pneumonia:** Increased from 0.3% in Test 1 to 0.8% in Test 2.
*   **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** Unchanged at 0.8% for both tests. *Tannerella forsythia* accounted for all 0.8% in Test 2.
*   **Sjogren's Syndrome:** Unchanged at 0.2% for both tests.
*   **Lupus:** Increased from 0.7% in Test 1 to 2.3% in Test 2.

### Summary of Systemic Health-Linked Oral Bacteria

The sum of bacteria linked with adverse health conditions outside the mouth was 4.3% for Test 1, with a minor improvement to 3.4% for Test 2. These changes are very small for each respective condition.

Overall, the addition of 4 grams per liter of potassium nitrate to the prebiotic mouthwash did not appear to have a major impact on salivary bacterial composition.

## Future Strategy: Addressing Key Bacteria

Given the results, the potassium nitrate concentration in the mouthwash will be halved for Test 3, reducing it to 2 grams per liter, before considering complete removal.

### Identifying Target Bacteria

*Fusobacterium nucleatum* and *Tannerella forsythia* consistently appeared as major contributors to multiple adverse oral and systemic health conditions. Targeting these two bacteria is identified as a primary strategy for improving the salivary microbiome.

### Beta-Caryophyllene and Clove Oil Research

*   **Tannerella forsythia:** Beta-caryophyllene, a compound found in clove oil, has been shown to reduce *T. forsythia* growth *in vitro*. A relatively low concentration of beta-caryophyllene can lead to an 80% reduction in *T. forsythia* growth compared to controls.
*   **Fusobacterium nucleatum:** Beta-caryophyllene and clove oil have also been shown to reduce *F. nucleatum* growth and kill the bacteria *in vitro*.
    *   **Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC):** The minimum amount to inhibit growth.
    *   **Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC):** The minimum amount to completely kill the bacteria.
    *   Clove oil showed significantly lower MIC and MBC values (0.1% and 0.2%, respectively) compared to beta-caryophyllene for *F. nucleatum*, indicating greater potency.

These *in vitro* findings suggest that clove oil could be effective against both *T. forsythia* and *F. nucleatum*.

### Planned Mouthwash Modification for Test 3

For the next test, the mouthwash will be modified as follows:

*   Reduce **Potassium Nitrate** to 2 grams per liter (halving the previous amount).
*   Add **3 drops of Clove Oil**, an equivalent amount to the existing peppermint oil.

This modification will be tested, and the salivary microbiome will be re-evaluated to determine its effect.
