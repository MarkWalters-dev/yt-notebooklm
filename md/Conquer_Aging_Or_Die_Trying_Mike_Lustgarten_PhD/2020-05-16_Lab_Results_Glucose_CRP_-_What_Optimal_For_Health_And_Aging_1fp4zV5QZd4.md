# 2020-05-16 Lab Results Glucose CRP - What Optimal For Health And Aging

## Executive Summary

*   Aging is associated with increasing glucose levels, with optimal ranges for all-cause mortality risk found between 80-94 mg/dL.
*   Higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are linked to increased all-cause mortality, with levels below 0.33 mg/L appearing optimal.
*   Personal data suggests a strong correlation between higher fat and saturated fat intake and increased glucose levels.
*   Conversely, personal data indicates a correlation between higher fat and saturated fat intake and *lower* CRP levels.
*   Optimizing health biomarkers requires a process of trial and error, considering multiple factors rather than relying on a single metric.

## Glucose and Aging

### Age-Related Glucose Trends

*   Studies involving millions of subjects show that glucose levels generally increase with age.
*   In men, glucose levels increase until around age 60, then plateau with a slight increase in later life.
*   In women, glucose levels show a more linear increase from an earlier age through older adulthood.

### Optimal Glucose for Mortality Risk

*   Analysis of all-cause mortality risk versus circulating glucose concentration indicates a U-shaped curve.
*   The lowest risk for all-cause mortality is observed in the range of **80 to 94 mg/dL**.
*   Glucose levels **below 80 mg/dL** and **above 94 mg/dL** are associated with significantly increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   Therefore, maintaining glucose levels within the **80-94 mg/dL** range is suggested as optimal for health and aging.

### Personal Glucose Data and Diet Correlation

*   Personal average blood glucose levels have remained stable between 2005-2015 (89 mg/dL) and more recent tracking with diet monitoring (87.7 mg/dL), indicating resistance to age-related increases.
*   A strong positive correlation (0.75) exists between personal daily fat intake and blood glucose levels, suggesting that higher fat intake leads to higher glucose.
*   Within fat intake, saturated fat shows a moderately strong positive correlation with glucose levels, suggesting it may be a significant driver of this association.

## C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Aging

### Age-Related CRP Trends

*   C-reactive protein (CRP) levels also increase with aging.
*   For men, CRP levels can increase more than fivefold during aging.
*   For women, CRP levels can increase more than threefold during aging.

### Optimal CRP for Mortality Risk

*   The standard reference range for CRP is 0-3 mg/L, but this does not indicate optimal levels for aging.
*   Lower CRP levels are consistently associated with lower all-cause mortality risk.
*   Studies suggest progressively lower optimal thresholds:
    *   Less than 1 mg/L is associated with reduced all-cause mortality.
    *   Levels around 0.83-0.86 mg/L have been observed.
    *   The lowest risk of death from all causes is associated with CRP levels **less than 0.33 mg/L**.
*   The data suggests that lower CRP levels, as close to zero as possible, are optimal.

### Personal CRP Data and Diet Correlation

*   Personal data shows a negative correlation between average daily fat intake and CRP levels, meaning higher fat intake is associated with *lower* CRP.
*   Specifically, higher saturated fat intake is strongly correlated with *lower* CRP.
*   This suggests that increasing saturated fat intake (e.g., from coconut butter and cocoa beans) *could* lower CRP based on this personal data.

## Interplay and Optimization

*   The personal data highlights a conflict: higher fat intake is linked to increased glucose (undesirable) but lower CRP (desirable).
*   This illustrates that optimizing health is a process of continuous trial and error, requiring careful consideration of multiple biomarkers.
*   Claiming definitive dietary advice based on a single test is considered unreliable.
*   The goal is to find a dietary "sweet spot" that optimizes multiple health markers simultaneously.
