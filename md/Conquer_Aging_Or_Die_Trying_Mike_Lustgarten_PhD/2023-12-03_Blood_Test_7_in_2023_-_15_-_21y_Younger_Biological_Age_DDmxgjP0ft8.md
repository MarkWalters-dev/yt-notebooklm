# 2023-12-03 Blood Test 7 in 2023 - 15 - 21y Younger Biological Age

### Executive Summary

*   The speaker's biological age, as calculated by Dr. Morgan Levine's PhenoAge, is 35.6 years, which is 15.2 years younger than their chronological age. Using aging.ai, the biological age is 30 years, 20.8 years younger than chronological.
*   Both PhenoAge and aging.ai are strongly correlated with chronological age (0.96 and 0.8 respectively) and significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk.
*   Recent blood tests show improved HDL levels, consistently at or above 50 mg/dL, and neutrophil levels returning to the optimal 2,000-3,000 range.
*   Creatinine levels, a marker for kidney function, have shown a statistically significant increase from an average of 0.95 mg/dL to 1.01 mg/dL in recent tests, indicating a potential area for optimization.
*   Upcoming blood tests include measurements for free testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, NAD, epigenetic, telomere, and metabolomic data.

## Biological Age: PhenoAge (Levine's Test)

For the seventh blood test in 2023, Dr. Morgan Levine's phenotypic age calculator was used to determine biological age.

*   **Current Biological Age:** 35.6 years, which is 15.2 years younger than chronological age.
*   **CRP Measurement:** High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was less than 0.3 milligrams per liter, the lower limit of detection for the Quest lab. This suggests the biological age could be slightly lower if CRP were quantifiable below this threshold.

### Historical PhenoAge Data (29 Tests since 2018)

*   **2018-2019 (3 tests):** Average biological age of 36.1 years.
*   **2020-2021 (12 tests):** Average biological age of 35.6 years.
*   **2022 (multiple tests):** Average biological age of 33.8 years.
*   **2023 (7 tests):** Average biological age of 34.7 years.

A two-sample t-test comparing the 12 tests from 2020-2021 (average 35.6 years) to the last 14 tests from 2022-2023 showed a significantly lower biological age in the latter period (p < 0.05). This indicates a significant reduction in biological age over the past 14 tests relative to 2020-2021.

## PhenoAge Validation & Mortality Risk

PhenoAge (Levine's test) is a robust metric for biological age.

*   **Correlation with Chronological Age:**
    *   NHANES IV study (over 11,000 people, 20-90 year age range): PhenoAge showed a strong, almost perfectly linear correlation with chronological age at 0.96.
    *   NHANES III study (over 9,900 people): PhenoAge showed a similarly strong correlation with chronological age at 0.94.
    *   These correlations (0.94-0.96) are comparable to the best epigenetic clocks, such as the Horvath clock, for predicting chronological age.

*   **Association with All-Cause Mortality Risk:**
    *   For every one-year increase in PhenoAge, there is a significant 9% increase in the risk of death from all causes.

*   **Association with Cause-Specific Mortality:**
    *   **Cardiovascular Disease (CVD):** A one-year PhenoAge increase is associated with a 10% higher risk of death from CVD.
    *   **Cancer:** A one-year PhenoAge increase is associated with a 7% increase in cancer mortality.
    *   **Diabetes:** A one-year PhenoAge increase is associated with a 20% increase in diabetes-related mortality.
    *   **Chronic Lower Respiratory Diseases:** A one-year PhenoAge increase is associated with a 9% increase in mortality from these diseases.
    *   **Alzheimer's Disease:** PhenoAge is not significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease-related mortality (p > 0.05).
    *   All other associations had p-values less than 0.05, indicating statistical significance.

## Biological Age: Aging.ai

Aging.ai is another free and useful tool for biological age calculation.

*   **Correlation with Chronological Age:** Aging.ai shows a strong correlation coefficient of 0.8 with chronological age (a correlation higher than 0.7 is considered strong).

## Aging.ai Validation & Mortality Risk

Aging.ai is significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk.

*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:**
    *   Individuals with an aging.ai biological age at least five years younger than their chronological age had a significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk.
    *   Conversely, individuals with an aging.ai biological age at least five years older than their chronological age had a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk.

## Personal Biomarker Trends

### Current Aging.ai Data

*   **Current Biological Age:** For the recent test, using 19 component biomarkers with the North American dataset, the aging.ai age is 30 years, which is 20.8 years younger than chronological age.

### Historical Aging.ai Data (44 Tests since 2009)

*   **2009-2013 (3 tests):** Average aging.ai age was 32 years.
*   **2016-2022 (34 tests):** Average aging.ai age was 29.8 years.
*   **2023 (7 tests):** Average aging.ai age was 30 years.

Over the last eight years (2016-2023), the speaker's aging.ai age has remained stable at an average of 30 years.

### Key Biomarker Highlights from Latest Blood Test

*   **High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL):**
    *   Current: 56 mg/dL.
    *   Trend: For the last five tests, HDL has been consistently greater than or equal to 50 mg/dL. In contrast, for the 43 tests prior to that (since 2015), the average HDL was 45 mg/dL. This indicates significant progress in reaching the optimal 50-60 mg/dL range.
*   **High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP):**
    *   Current: Less than 0.3 mg/L (consistent with previous results and below the lab's detection limit).
*   **Creatinine (Kidney Function):**
    *   **Aging Trend:** Creatinine levels typically increase with aging as kidney function declines in removing it from the blood.
    *   **Personal Trend:** For the last five tests, the average creatinine level has been 1.01 mg/dL. In contrast, over the previous 43 tests (since 2015), it was 0.95 mg/dL.
    *   **Significance:** This small difference is statistically significant (p < 0.05). The increase is noted as moving in the "wrong direction," and the goal is to return it to at least 0.95 mg/dL or lower, without negatively impacting muscle mass (as creatinine is proportional to muscle mass).
*   **Neutrophils:**
    *   **Optimal Range:** 2,000 to 3,000.
    *   **Risk Factors:** Levels less than 2,000 are associated with an increased risk of death from all causes. Higher levels increase during aging and are also associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Personal Trend:** For a couple of tests in 2023, neutrophil levels were less than 2,000. The current test shows levels just above 2,000, returning to the desired range.

## Future Research & Testing

Additional blood test results are pending and will be detailed in upcoming videos:

*   Free testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin.
*   NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) quantification.
*   Epigenetic and telomere testing.
*   Metabolomics analysis.
