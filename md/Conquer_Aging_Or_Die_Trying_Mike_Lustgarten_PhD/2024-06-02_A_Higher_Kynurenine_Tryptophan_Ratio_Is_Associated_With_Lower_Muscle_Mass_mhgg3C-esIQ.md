# 2024-06-02 A Higher Kynurenine Tryptophan Ratio Is Associated With Lower Muscle Mass

## Executive Summary

*   Inflammaging, an age-related increase in inflammation, induces the enzyme Indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO).
*   IDO catalyzes the degradation of tryptophan into kynurenine, leading to an increased kynurenine to tryptophan ratio (KTR) with aging.
*   A higher KTR is associated with increased all-cause mortality risk, with the lowest risk observed at KTRs between 15-23 and significantly increased risk at KTRs greater than 25.
*   A higher KTR is also associated with reduced muscle mass, particularly in older adults.

## Inflammaging and the Kynurenine Pathway

*   Aging is characterized by an increase in inflammation, termed **inflammaging**.
*   Inflammaging induces the expression of the enzyme **Indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)**.
*   IDO catalyzes the degradation of the amino acid **tryptophan** into **kynurenine**.

### Kynurenine to Tryptophan Ratio (KTR) and Mortality Risk

*   The KTR increases with age.
*   A higher KTR is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Hazard Ratio for All-Cause Mortality:**
    *   KTR in the **15-23 range** was associated with the **lowest** all-cause mortality risk.
    *   KTR values **greater than 25** were associated with a **significantly increased** all-cause mortality risk.

## KTR and Muscle Mass

*   A higher KTR is associated with reduced muscle mass.
*   **Study of 85-year-olds (n=85):**
    *   Participants were divided into tertiles based on muscle mass divided by body weight, quantified using deuterium labeled creatine (D3-CR).
    *   **Lowest Muscle Mass/Body Weight Tertile:**
        *   Highest KTR (0.45).
    *   **Intermediate Muscle Mass/Body Weight Tertile:**
        *   Intermediate KTR.
    *   **Highest Muscle Mass/Body Weight Tertile:**
        *   Lowest KTR.
*   **Conclusion:** A higher KTR is associated with lower muscle mass, and conversely, a lower KTR is associated with higher muscle mass.

## Personal KTR Tracking and Optimization

*   The KTR can be tracked and potentially optimized.
*   **Personal Data (using IOLO's Metabolomic Kit):**
    *   **2023 Data (8 tests):** Average KTR was 24 nmol/µmol. This is just outside the range for lowest all-cause mortality risk (15-23) and not at the higher risk level ( > 25).
    *   **2024 Data (3 tests):** Average KTR is now 23 nmol/µmol. This is at the high end of the range for lowest all-cause mortality risk, with a desire to lower it further.
*   **Dietary Correlations:** Data on dietary correlations with KTR is currently available on Patreon. Preliminary findings indicate no significant correlations with macros, micros, or specific foods tested after test number eight. Further analysis will be performed and posted on Patreon.
