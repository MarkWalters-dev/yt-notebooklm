# 2020-07-01 Are there foods that can increase NAD Part I

## Executive Summary

*   NAD levels decline with age, impacting the health and function of nearly all bodily systems.
*   Apigenin and Quercetin are dietary compounds that inhibit CD38, an enzyme that degrades NAD.
*   Increasing concentrations of Apigenin and Quercetin lead to decreased CD38 activity.
*   Inhibition of CD38 by Apigenin and Quercetin results in increased intracellular NAD levels.
*   Parsley is the most concentrated dietary source of Apigenin, while dill and red/purple onions are the best sources of Quercetin.

## NAD and Aging

NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) is a vital coenzyme involved in the health and functioning of virtually every organ system and tissue in the human body. NAD levels decrease with age, contributing to age-related decline.

## Strategies to Increase NAD Levels

Several strategies have been shown to increase NAD levels:

*   **NAD Boosters:** Supplements like nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN).
*   **Exercise:** Physical activity has been demonstrated to raise NAD levels.
*   **Dietary Interventions:**
    *   Fasting
    *   Calorie restriction

## Dietary Components that Boost NAD: Apigenin and Quercetin

Apigenin and Quercetin are two dietary compounds that can boost NAD levels by inhibiting CD38 activity.

### CD38: The NAD Degrading Enzyme

*   CD38 is an enzyme that degrades NAD.
*   CD38 levels increase with age, which is a primary explanation for the decrease in NAD levels observed during aging.

### Mechanism of Action: Apigenin and Quercetin

The data indicates that Apigenin and Quercetin inhibit CD38 activity:

*   As the concentration of Apigenin increases, intracellular CD38 activity decreases.
*   Similarly, as the concentration of Quercetin increases, intracellular CD38 activity decreases.

This inhibition of CD38 leads to a corresponding increase in NAD levels:

*   NAD levels increase by approximately 50% in the presence of Apigenin.
*   A smaller but still significant increase in NAD levels is observed with Quercetin.

## Dietary Sources of Apigenin and Quercetin

To maximize intracellular NAD levels through diet, it is beneficial to include foods rich in Apigenin and Quercetin.

### Apigenin Sources

*   **Parsley:** The most concentrated source of Apigenin (215.5 mg per 100 grams).
    *   *Personal Consumption Example:* Adding approximately 40 grams of parsley to a smoothie every other day.

### Quercetin Sources

The two best dietary sources of Quercetin are:

*   **Dill:** (55.5 mg per 100 grams)
*   **Red or Purple Onions:**
    *   *Personal Consumption Example:* Pickling dill by combining a few bunches with jalapenos and spices, consuming about 15 grams or more after fermentation.

The speaker emphasizes a preference for whole foods over supplements. Including foods like parsley, dill, and purple onions is suggested for their Apigenin and Quercetin content to support NAD levels.
