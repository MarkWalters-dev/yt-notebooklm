# 2021-05-16 VLDL Increases During Aging And Is Associated With Adverse Cardiovascular Outcomes

## Executive Summary

*   VLDL levels increase with age, with levels in youth (15-24 years) being significantly lower than in older adults (up to 79 years).
*   Elevated VLDL levels (≥ 20 mg/dL) are associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse cardiovascular disease outcomes, including heart attack, sudden cardiac death, and coronary death.
*   Remnant cholesterol, which is primarily composed of VLDL in a fasting state, is also strongly associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk, independent of LDL cholesterol.
*   High remnant cholesterol (≥ 31 mg/dL) is associated with a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular events.
*   Increasing daily calorie intake is significantly correlated with increased VLDL levels.

## Introduction to VLDL and Remnant Cholesterol

*   **VLDL (Very Low-Density Lipoprotein)** is a type of cholesterol particle.
*   **Remnant Cholesterol** in a fasting state is defined as the combination of Intermediate Density Lipoprotein (IDL) and VLDL.
*   **Calculation of Remnant Cholesterol (Fasting):** Total Cholesterol (TC) - HDL - LDL = Remnant Cholesterol (IDL + VLDL).

## VLDL as a Marker of Fatty Liver

A metabolic pathway illustrating how increased VLDL can indicate fatty liver:

Obesity, Insulin Resistance, or Hypercaloric Diet
-> Increased Lipolysis in Adipose Tissue
-> Systemic Increase in Free Fatty Acids (FFAs)
-> FFAs taken up by the Liver
-> FFAs packaged into Triglycerides (TGs)
-> Increased Triglycerides in the Liver
-> Accumulation of Lipid Droplets (Steatosis)
-> Lipid Droplets packaged with Cholesterol and Proteins into VLDL
-> Increased Circulating VLDL Levels (Indicator of Fatty Liver)

## VLDL Levels and Aging

*   **Youth (15-24 years):**
    *   Men: VLDL < 20 mg/dL
    *   Women: VLDL < 15 mg/dL
*   **Aging (25-79 years):**
    *   VLDL levels increase gradually in both men and women, reaching approximately 30 mg/dL.

## VLDL and Cardiovascular Disease Risk

*   Elevated VLDL levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, defined as risk for acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), sudden cardiac death, and other coronary death.
*   **VLDL 20-29 mg/dL:** Associated with a 38% increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes compared to VLDL < 20 mg/dL.
*   **VLDL > 30 mg/dL:** Associated with a 44% increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes compared to VLDL < 20 mg/dL.

## Remnant Cholesterol and Cardiovascular Disease Risk

Studies evaluating remnant cholesterol have shown it to be a significant predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, independent of LDL cholesterol. In fasting states, remnant cholesterol is largely composed of VLDL.

### Study Findings on Remnant Cholesterol:

*   **Study 1 (approx. 6,900 subjects):**
    *   **HDL:** Not significantly associated with adverse CVD outcomes.
    *   **LDL:** Not significantly associated with adverse CVD outcomes.
    *   **Remnant Cholesterol:**
        *   Higher levels found in individuals who experienced a cardiovascular event compared to those who did not.
        *   For every 10 mg/dL increase in remnant cholesterol, there was a 21% increased risk for adverse CVD outcomes.
    *   **Remnant Cholesterol Quartiles:**
        *   **Reference:** Remnant cholesterol < 17.5 mg/dL.
        *   **Significantly Increased Risk:** Remnant cholesterol ≥ 30.95 mg/dL (approximately 31 mg/dL or higher).
        *   **Conclusion:** Remnant cholesterol > 31 mg/dL is associated with significantly increased CVD risk.

*   **Study 2 (134 people with LDL < 70 mg/dL, 110 on statins):**
    *   Investigated variables associated with coronary atherosclerosis in individuals with ostensibly optimal LDL.
    *   **Diabetes and Hypertension:** Not associated with significant coronary atherosclerosis.
    *   **Low HDL (< 39 mg/dL):** Associated with a threefold higher odds of significant coronary atherosclerosis.
    *   **High Remnant Cholesterol:** Associated with approximately a fourfold higher risk of significant coronary atherosclerosis.
    *   **Conclusion:** Low LDL combined with high VLDL or low HDL may contribute to atherosclerosis progression.

*   **Study 3 (Premature Heart Attack Risk):**
    *   Examined factors associated with premature heart attack (younger than 55 in men, younger than 65 in women) in a population including 35-year-olds.
    *   **Variables Associated with Premature Heart Attack Risk:**
        *   Non-HDL cholesterol (LDL + Lp(a) + IDL + VLDL): ~3-fold higher risk.
        *   Higher Triglycerides: Increased risk.
        *   Higher Remnant to HDL Cholesterol Ratio: Increased risk.
        *   Higher Total Cholesterol: Increased risk.
        *   Higher LDL to HDL Cholesterol Ratio: Increased risk.
        *   Higher ApoB (LDL + Lp(a) + IDL + VLDL): Increased risk.
        *   **Remnant Cholesterol:** Highest risk, a 3.87-fold higher risk when elevated.

## Personal VLDL Tracking and Dietary Correlations

The speaker tracked their VLDL levels from 2005 to the present.

*   **Pre-Diet Tracking (2005-2013):**
    *   Average VLDL: 13.2 mg/dL.
*   **Diet Tracking (2015-Present):**
    *   Average VLDL reduced to 11 mg/dL during this period.
    *   A T-test showed a significant difference between pre-diet tracking and diet tracking VLDL levels.
*   **Recent Trend (Past 6 Measurements):**
    *   Average VLDL: 13.3 mg/dL.
    *   This indicates VLDL levels have increased in the most recent measurements, moving in the "wrong direction."
    *   A T-test showed a significant difference between the last 6 measurements and the previous 24 measurements from 2015 forward.

### Correlation with Dietary Factors:

*   **Variables Considered:** Total calories, total carbohydrate, total fructose, total protein, total fiber, total fat (including MUFA, omega-3, omega-6, saturated fats).
*   **Most Significant Correlation with VLDL:** Average daily calorie intake.
    *   **Nature of Correlation:** Significant positive correlation.
    *   **Implication:** As calorie intake increases, VLDL levels correspondingly increase.
*   **Target for Lower VLDL:** Aiming for approximately 2,500 calories per day or less to maintain lower VLDL levels.
