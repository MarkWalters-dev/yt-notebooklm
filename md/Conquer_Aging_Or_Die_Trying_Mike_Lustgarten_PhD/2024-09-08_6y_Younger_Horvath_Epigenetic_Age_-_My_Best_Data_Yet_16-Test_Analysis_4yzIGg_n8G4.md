# 2024-09-08 6y Younger Horvath Epigenetic Age - My Best Data Yet 16-Test Analysis

**Executive Summary:**
*   The Horvath epigenetic clock demonstrates a strong correlation with chronological age (r=0.94, p < 1 x 10^-200).
*   The speaker's Horvath epigenetic age, initially older than chronological, achieved its best-ever result of 45.7 years in the latest test, making it approximately six years younger than chronological age.
*   A strategy involving tracking correlations between diet/supplement intake and Horvath epigenetic age, followed by intentional dietary adjustments, is employed to optimize this biomarker.
*   Significant positive correlations were found between older Horvath age and higher intake of saturated fat (especially from coconut butter), protein, alfalfa sprouts, peanuts, and trigonelline. Inverse correlations were observed for cloves and cinnamon.
*   After implementing dietary changes based on these correlations, subsequent analysis showed strengthening correlations for saturated fat, coconut butter, and cloves, suggesting potential causal roles in modulating Horvath epigenetic age.

## Horvath Epigenetic Clock Basics

The Horvath clock is a highly accurate epigenetic clock for predicting chronological age, derived from multi-cell and tissue types. DNA methylation age (epigenetic age) is plotted against chronological age, demonstrating an almost perfectly linear correlation with a coefficient of 0.94. The statistical significance is extremely high, with a p-value of 1 x 10^-200, far below the 0.05 threshold.

## Personal Horvath Epigenetic Age Data Analysis (16 Tests)

The speaker's personal data tracking Horvath epigenetic age across 16 tests reveals a trend of improvement:

*   **2022 (3 tests):** Average Horvath age was 55 years, which was 6 years older than the chronological age of 49 years.
*   **2023 (8 tests):** Average Horvath age improved to 52.8 years, reducing the gap to 3 years older than chronological age.
*   **2024 (5 tests to date):** The average Horvath age is 53.3 years, currently 2 years older than chronological age.

A significant individual test result occurred on **July 26, 2024**, where the Horvath epigenetic age was **45.7 years**. This represents the best data point yet, indicating an age approximately 6 years younger than chronological age. This reduction to younger than chronological age after 16 tests suggests an unlikely but positive development, given that Horvath age typically increases with chronological age.

**Caveats:**
*   The overall 2024 average (53.3 years) does not reflect the significant drop of the latest test due to previous 2024 tests having higher ages (e.g., 58 years).
*   The test may exhibit high variability, as evidenced by a 12-year swing between individual test results (e.g., 58 down to 45.7 years). Such a wide range is not observed with other biomarkers like PhenoAge. This raises the question of inherent test-to-test measurement variability.

## Strategy for Optimizing Horvath Epigenetic Age

A strategy is employed to identify and test potential causal factors influencing Horvath epigenetic age:
1.  After each test, calculate correlations between Horvath epigenetic age and diet, supplements, fitness metrics, sleep, and other variables.
2.  Identify foods/nutrients with statistically significant correlations (p < 0.05).
3.  Formulate a hypothesis: If a food or nutrient is causally involved, its correlation strength will increase over time when dietary changes align with the correlation. If not, it will weaken.
4.  Adjust intake of correlated items:
    *   For **positive correlations** (higher intake correlated with older epigenetic age), reduce intake or keep it towards the lower end of the historical range.
    *   For **inverse correlations** (higher intake correlated with younger epigenetic age), increase intake or keep it towards the higher end of the historical range.
5.  Re-evaluate correlations after subsequent tests to observe changes in strength.

### Correlations Following Test 15 (Prior to July Test)

An analysis of 15 tests revealed several statistically significant correlations (p < 0.05) with Horvath epigenetic age:

*   **Positive Correlations (Higher intake correlated with older Horvath age):**
    *   Protein (r = 0.76)
    *   Total Fat (r = 0.73)
    *   Saturated Fatty Acids (r = 0.62)
    *   Coconut Butter (r = 0.54)
    *   Alfalfa Sprouts
    *   Peanuts
    *   Trigonelline
*   **Inverse Correlations (Higher intake correlated with younger Horvath age):**
    *   Cloves (r = -0.62)
    *   Cinnamon (r = -0.58)

## Dietary Adjustments Based on Test 15 Correlations

Based on the correlations identified after Test 15, the following dietary changes were implemented for the 59-day period leading up to Test 16 (July test):

*   **Positive Correlations - Reduced Intake:**
    *   **Total Fat:** Reduced from an average of 93 grams/day to 83 grams/day (10g reduction).
    *   **Saturated Fat:** Reduced from 22 grams/day to 14 grams/day. This reduction was primarily from:
        *   **Coconut Butter:** Reduced from an average of 18 grams/day to 2 grams/day.
*   **Inverse Correlations - Increased Intake:**
    *   **Cloves:** Increased from 0 grams/day to 0.4 grams/day (consumed a couple of grams a couple of times per week).
    *   **Cinnamon:** Increased from 0 grams/day to 0.5 grams/day (consumed a couple of grams a couple of times per week).

**Note on Protein:** Despite a positive correlation (r=0.76), protein intake was increased from 105 grams/day to 112 grams/day, going against the suggested correlation. Overall, 7 out of 9 correlations were followed.

## Correlations Following Test 16 (After July Test)

After the July test (Test 16), correlations were recalculated to observe changes in strength. The premise is that if a food or nutrient is causally involved, its correlation will strengthen; otherwise, it will weaken. All listed correlations below have a p-value less than 0.03.

*   **Strengthened Positive Correlations (Supporting Causality):**
    *   **Saturated Fat:** Increased from r = 0.62 to r = 0.78.
    *   **Coconut Butter:** Increased from r = 0.54 to r = 0.75.
*   **Strengthened Inverse Correlations (Supporting Causality):**
    *   **Cloves:** Became more negative, from r = -0.62 to r = -0.70.
*   **Weakened Correlations:**
    *   **Total Fat:** Decreased from r = 0.73 to r = 0.55. This suggests the impact might be more specific to saturated fat and coconut butter rather than total fat broadly.
    *   **Protein, Peanuts, Cinnamon, and Trigonelline:** These correlations weakened and are no longer among the top nine significant correlations.

## Current Actions for Test 17

With the goal of replicating or improving the 45.7-year Horvath epigenetic age result, the following actions are being taken prior to Test 17:

*   **Saturated Fat (specifically from coconut butter):** Kept low at 2 grams/day.
*   **Cloves:** Increased intake further from 0.4 grams/day to 0.5 grams/day.
*   **Total Fat:** Reduced slightly further to 81 grams/day (from 83 grams/day).

New correlations that emerged after Test 16 are also being addressed:

*   **Sardines:** Were at their highest intake prior to Test 15 but were then cut back due to other biomarker concerns (blood urea nitrogen, uric acid). Considering their potential role in Horvath age, intake may be increased again, especially if the 45.7-year result is not repeated.
*   **Copper & Vitamin B5:** These have positive correlations, so intake is being slightly reduced relative to the last test.
*   **Manganese:** This has an inverse correlation, so intake is being slightly increased relative to the last test.
*   **Vitamin E:** This correlation is not currently being followed as strictly. High intake of Vitamin E previously, partly from broccoli sprouts and broccoli, may have negatively impacted nighttime respiratory rate, heart rate variability, and resting heart rate. Intake is currently slightly lower than before the last test.

Overall, 7 out of 9 correlations are currently being followed for Test 17.
