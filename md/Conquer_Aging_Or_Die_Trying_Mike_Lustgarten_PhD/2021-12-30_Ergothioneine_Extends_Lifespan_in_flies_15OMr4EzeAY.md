# 2021-12-30 Ergothioneine Extends Lifespan in flies

## Executive Summary
*   Ergothioneine supplementation significantly extended median lifespan in both male and female fruit flies (Canton S and YW strains) at specific doses, particularly 100 micromolar.
*   However, lower or higher doses of ergothioneine sometimes resulted in a decrease in median lifespan, indicating a dose-dependent effect.
*   The lifespan-extending effects of ergothioneine were dependent on the gut microbiome, as the benefits were abolished in antibiotic-treated flies.
*   Ergothioneine supplementation led to reduced oxidative stress, evidenced by an improved GSH to GSSG ratio and increased antioxidant enzyme levels (SOD and CAT) in older flies.
*   Ergothioneine does not appear to exert its lifespan effects through a mild calorie restriction mechanism, as food intake was not significantly altered.

## Fruit Fly Data: Canton S Strain

### Lifespan Extension in Female Flies
*   Ergothioneine at intermediate doses (10 micromolar to 1 millimolar) extended median lifespan by 11-15% compared to the control diet (CK).
*   Relatively smaller doses (100 nanomolar) and higher doses (10 millimolar) resulted in smaller lifespan increases (1-2%).

### Lifespan in Male Flies
*   Ergothioneine at 1 millimolar and 100 micromolar increased median lifespan by 9-12% compared to the control diet (CK).
*   A lower intake dose of 1 micromolar ergothioneine resulted in a 6% decrease in median lifespan.

## Fruit Fly Data: YW Strain

### Lifespan in Female Flies
*   Intermediate doses of ergothioneine (1 millimolar and 100 micromolar) significantly increased median lifespan.
*   Lower doses (100 nanomolar) and higher doses (10 millimolar) resulted in a significant decrease in median lifespan.

### Lifespan in Male Flies
*   Intermediate doses of ergothioneine (100 micromolar and 10 millimolar) increased median lifespan by 6-7%.
*   A higher dose of 10 millimolar ergothioneine resulted in a small but significant decrease in median lifespan.
*   The lowest doses (1 micromolar and 100 nanomolar) showed a decrease in median lifespan, though these were not statistically significant.

## Consistent Lifespan Extension

*   A dose of 100 micromolar ergothioneine consistently extended lifespan in both Canton S and YW fly strains, in both male and female flies.

## Mechanism of Action: Calorie Restriction

*   **Food Intake Study:**
    *   Flies (10 and 30 days old) were fed a control diet versus a diet supplemented with 100 micromolar ergothioneine.
    *   Food intake was measured after 1-hour and 48-hour feeding periods.
    *   No significant difference in food intake was observed between the control and ergothioneine-supplemented groups for either age group.
*   **Conclusion:** Calorie restriction is not responsible for ergothioneine's lifespan-extending effects.

## Mechanism of Action: Gut Microbiome

*   **Antibiotic Treatment Study:**
    *   Flies (control and ergothioneine supplemented) were treated with antibiotics to deplete the gut microbiome.
    *   Lifespan was compared between ergothioneine-antibiotic treated and control-antibiotic treated flies.
    *   The lifespan-extending effect of ergothioneine was absent in antibiotic-treated flies.
*   **Conclusion:** The gut microbiome is responsible for the lifespan-extending effect of ergothioneine.

## Mechanism of Action: Oxidative Stress Reduction

### GSH to GSSG Ratio
*   **Measure of Oxidative Stress:** The ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) indicates the level of oxidative stress. A higher ratio signifies lower oxidative stress.
*   **GSH to GSSG Process:**
    GSH + Oxidant (e.g., H₂O₂) -> GSSG
*   **Findings:**
    *   In young (10-day-old) flies, there was no difference in the GSH to GSSG ratio between control and ergothioneine-supplemented groups.
    *   In older (30-day-old) flies, the GSH to GSSG ratio was significantly reduced (indicating lower oxidative stress) in ergothioneine-supplemented flies compared to control flies.

### Antioxidant Levels
*   **SOD and CAT Enzymes:** Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) converts superoxide to hydrogen peroxide, and Catalase (CAT) degrades hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, both crucial for antioxidant defense.
*   **Findings:**
    *   In young (10-day-old) flies, there was no difference in SOD or CAT levels.
    *   In older (30 and 50-day-old) flies, ergothioneine-fed flies showed significant increases in both SOD and CAT levels compared to control flies.
*   **Conclusion:** Increased antioxidant levels contribute to the improved GSH to GSSG ratio observed in ergothioneine-supplemented flies.

## Food Sources Rich in Ergothioneine

*   **Low Content:** Oats, kidney beans, oat bran.
*   **Moderate Content:** Garlic, chicken liver, Mexican asparagus, tempeh (soy product).
*   **High Content:** Mushrooms (white button mushrooms and gray oyster mushrooms have the highest ergothioneine content compared to other listed foods).

*   **Note:** Mushrooms also contain spermidine, another compound shown to extend lifespan.
