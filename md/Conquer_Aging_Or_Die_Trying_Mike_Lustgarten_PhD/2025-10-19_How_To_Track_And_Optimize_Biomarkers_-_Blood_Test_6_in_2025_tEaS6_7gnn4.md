# 2025-10-19 How To Track And Optimize Biomarkers - Blood Test 6 in 2025

### Executive Summary

*   The individual's biological age, calculated by Dr. Morgan Levine's Feno Age, is 35.4 years, which is 17.2 years younger than their chronological age.
*   Frequent blood testing (multiple times per year) is critical for accurately tracking the "rate of aging" and year-to-year biomarker changes, providing a more reliable trend than infrequent testing.
*   Despite chronological aging, the individual has resisted an age-related increase in biological age; Feno Age typically rises by 0.9 years per chronological year.
*   Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), a measure of red blood cell volume, has shown an increasing trend over the past five years, moving away from the optimal target of approximately 90 femtoliters (fL).
*   Dietary correlation analysis identified a strong positive correlation between Brazil nut intake and MCV; reducing daily Brazil nut consumption from 12g to 5g is being tested as an intervention to lower MCV.

## Biological Age Tracking: Feno Age

The individual's biological age, using Dr. Morgan Levine's Feno Age calculator, is 35.4 years, placing it 17.2 years younger than their chronological age. The maximum observed reduction for biological age relative to chronological age using this test is approximately 20 years. The goal is continuous improvement rather than maintenance or decline. While glucose is an area for potential improvement, the focus for this analysis is Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), which has shown an undesirable trend.

## Importance of Frequent Biomarker Testing

Many individuals in the longevity space test their blood once or twice per year. This raises questions about whether such infrequent testing truly represents a full-year average or accurately reflects the rate of aging. To obtain the closest approximation of the truth for tracking year-to-year change and moving biomarkers towards a more youthful state, frequent testing is necessary.

## Year-to-Year Biological Age Trends (2018-2025)

Over 43 blood tests since 2018, the average biological age (using Feno Age) has been tracked:

*   **2018-2019 (3 tests):** Average biological age was 34.3 years. (HSCRP was not consistently measured during this period).
*   **2020-2021 (6 tests each year, 12 total):** Average biological age remained at 33.9 years.
*   **2022 (7 tests):** Best year to date, averaging 32.1 years.
*   **2023 (7 tests):** Average biological age increased slightly to 32.9 years.
*   **2024 (8 tests):** Average biological age was 33.1 years.
*   **2025 (first 6 tests):** Current average is 33.1 years. The most recent test (35.4 years) was the second worst of the six tests this year, highlighting data variability.

This comprehensive approach of tracking all data, rather than cherry-picking, reveals a more accurate pace of aging. The individual has successfully resisted an age-related biological age increase; Feno Age typically increases by 0.9 years for every year of chronological age. Based on this expected increase since 2018, a biological age closer to 40 would be anticipated in 2025, making the current average of 33 years a positive outcome.

## Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)

MCV is the volume inside a red blood cell. Red blood cells are the most abundant human cell type, constituting approximately 80% of all human cells. Therefore, measuring their characteristics is crucial. Beyond MCV, other important metrics related to red blood cells include:

*   Total red blood cells
*   Hemoglobin content
*   Red blood cell volume variability (RDW)
*   Omega-3 index (proportion of EPA and DHA in red blood cell membranes)

### Optimal MCV

A lower MCV is generally considered better, with an optimal target around 90 femtoliters (fL) based on literature regarding its changes during aging and associations with all-cause mortality risk.

### MCV Trends (2015-2025)

Over 59 tests from 2015 to 2025, the MCV trend has been monitored:

*   **Initial Period (2015, first 5 tests):** MCV showed an increasing trend.
*   **Subsequent Period:** The trend reversed to a more favorable direction.
*   **Average MCV (first 24 tests):** 90.8 fL.
*   **Average MCV (next 35 tests):** 90.9 fL.

While the overall average MCV has remained close to the 90 fL target, a closer inspection of the data for the past five years reveals a clear increasing trend. This increase may be partly related to chronological aging or potentially to dietary changes implemented to impact other biomarkers.

## Investigating MCV Reduction: Diet Correlations

To reverse the MCV increase, dietary correlations were investigated.

### Methodology for Diet-Biomarker Correlation

The following step-by-step methodology is used to analyze dietary intake and its correlation with blood biomarkers:

*   Weigh almost all food daily (>99% since 2015).
*   Enter dietary data into a tracking application.
*   Export data into a spreadsheet.
*   Calculate the average daily dietary intake for the period between two blood tests.
*   Align this average dietary intake with the latter blood test. This creates a corresponding average dietary intake for every blood test.
*   Analyze correlations between dietary components (macros, micros, specific foods) and biomarker levels. This approach can also be applied to supplements, average daily heart rate, or steps.

### MCV Correlation Data: Brazil Nuts

Correlations were analyzed for 99 macro/micronutrients and foods versus MCV. A positive correlation indicates that higher intake of the food is significantly correlated with a higher MCV. Conversely, a negative correlation indicates that higher intake is correlated with a lower MCV. It is important to note that these are correlations, not necessarily causations; interventions are needed to confirm causal relationships.

| Dietary Component | R (Correlation Coefficient) | P-value                | N (Number of Tests) |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------ |
| Brazil Nuts       | 0.72                        | 3.0 x 10<sup>-5</sup> | 45                  |
| ... (partial list) | ...                         | ...                    | ...                 |

Brazil nuts were at the top of the list with a strong positive correlation (R=0.72, P=3x10<sup>-5</sup>) with MCV. This suggests that current Brazil nut intake might be too high.

### Intervention Strategy: Reducing Brazil Nut Intake

For the most recent test, the average daily Brazil nut intake was approximately 12 grams, corresponding to an MCV of 93 fL. To attempt to reduce MCV, Brazil nut intake has been cut to 5 grams per day for the period leading up to the next blood test. Based on the established trend line, an MCV closer to 90 fL would be expected if this correlation is causal.

This is an iterative process: if the MCV does not decrease after this intervention, the correlations will be re-evaluated after the next blood test (scheduled for late October). A lack of change would weaken the Brazil nut correlation, prompting investigation into other potential dietary factors (e.g., ginger, black pepper) for subsequent interventions. This continuous, iterative approach is fundamental to optimizing biomarkers.

Further analysis of the full blood test report, including diet, supplements, and prescription medications contributing to the 17-year younger biological age, will be covered in an upcoming analysis.
