# 2023-03-05 NAD Test 2 - Impact of NMN

**Executive Summary**
*   Initial intracellular NAD levels were measured at 25.6 micromolar, falling into the "aged" category according to Ginfinity's cutoffs.
*   Supplementation with 300mg of NMN daily for 21 days did not significantly alter intracellular NAD levels, which remained at 25.3 micromolar.
*   Further testing is planned after a switch to 1 gram of NMN daily for one week to assess its impact on NAD and other blood biomarkers.

## Baseline NAD Levels

*   **Initial Measurement:** 25.6 micromolar (January)
*   **Ginfinity's Cutoffs:**
    *   Aged Category: Below 40 micromolar
    *   Youthful Category: Above 40 micromolar
*   **Conclusion:** The initial NAD level of 25.6 micromolar was categorized as "aged."

## NMN Supplementation - Initial Phase

*   **Supplementation Started:** Immediately after baseline NAD test.
*   **Dosage:** 300 milligrams (mg) of NMN per day.
*   **Brand Switch:** Initially Nootropics Depot, switched to Ginfinity's brand after two days due to concerns about product purity.
*   **Duration:** 21 days.
*   **Follow-up NAD Test:** February 21st.
*   **Result:** Intracellular NAD level was 25.3 micromolar.
*   **Conclusion:** 300mg of NMN per day for 21 days did not lead to a significant increase in intracellular NAD levels.

## NMN Supplementation - Increased Dosage

*   **Dosage Change:** Switched to 1 gram (1000 mg) of NMN per day.
*   **Start Date:** February 28th.
*   **Next Test Date:** March 6th.
*   **Testing Period:** One week of 1 gram/day NMN supplementation prior to testing.
*   **Expected Analysis:** Impact on NAD levels and the full spectrum of common blood biomarkers.
