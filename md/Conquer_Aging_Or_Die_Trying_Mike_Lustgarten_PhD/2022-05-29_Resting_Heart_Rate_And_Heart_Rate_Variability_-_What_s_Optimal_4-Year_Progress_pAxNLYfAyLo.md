# 2022-05-29 Resting Heart Rate And Heart Rate Variability - What s Optimal 4-Year Progress

## Executive Summary

*   Resting heart rate (RHR) generally increases with age between 20-50 years, then declines after 50 years. Heart rate variability (HRV) consistently declines with age (20-60 years).
*   Youthful cardiovascular health is characterized by a relatively low RHR and high HRV. In contrast, advanced age (or lower fitness) typically shows a higher RHR and lower HRV.
*   Over a four-year period (2018-2022), the speaker successfully reduced their RHR from 51 bpm to 45.7 bpm and increased their HRV from 47.3 ms to 54.3 ms, resisting typical age-related changes and exhibiting cardiovascular metrics consistent with a younger age.
*   Body weight significantly correlates with both metrics: as body weight decreases, RHR decreases and HRV increases, indicating that lower body weight contributes to more youthful cardiovascular values.
*   Daily physical activity (indexed by average daily heart rate) showed a complex relationship: higher activity was associated with increased next-day RHR and decreased next-day HRV, suggesting that an optimal balance between activity and rest is crucial for cardiovascular metric optimization.

## Resting Heart Rate (RHR) and Aging

Resting heart rate (RHR) exhibits distinct trends across the lifespan. For individuals aged 20 to 50 years, RHR generally increases. However, after approximately 50 years of age, RHR tends to decline, extending up to the 85-year age range. This pattern indicates that relatively low RHR values can be found in both younger individuals and those in advanced age. This raises the question of whether a low RHR alone is indicative of youth or aging without further context.

## Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Explained

Heart rate variability (HRV) is defined as the variability in the time intervals between successive heartbeats. For example, a heart rate of 60 beats per minute does not necessarily mean a beat occurs exactly every second; the slight variations in these intervals constitute HRV.

## HRV Trends with Age

HRV clearly declines during aging. Data from over 8.2 million subjects (measured as RMSSD, the WHOOP metric) shows a decline in HRV from values approaching 80 milliseconds (ms) in 20-year-olds to less than 40 ms in 60-year-olds. It's also observed that HRV recorded later in the evening tends to be lower compared to recordings taken early in the morning.

## Differentiating Youthful vs. Aged Cardiovascular Metrics

To contextualize whether a low RHR indicates youth or aging, HRV provides crucial information:
*   **Youth (e.g., 20-year-olds):** Characterized by a relatively low RHR and a high HRV.
*   **Older Ages (e.g., 60-year-olds):** Characterized by a relatively higher RHR and a lower HRV.

Therefore, the combination of both metrics is essential for interpreting cardiovascular health relative to age.

## Personal Cardiovascular Metric Progress (2018-2022)

The speaker tracked RHR and HRV daily from August 2018 through April 2022, accumulating 1,360 days of data.

### Resting Heart Rate (RHR)
The speaker demonstrated a consistent reduction in RHR over the four-year period:
*   **2018:** Average daily RHR was approximately 51 beats per minute (bpm).
*   **2019:** Average RHR decreased to 48.9 bpm, a statistically significant reduction compared to 2018 (two-sample t-test).
*   **2020:** Average RHR further declined to 48.1 bpm, significantly lower than both 2018 and 2019 data (two-sample t-tests).
*   **2021:** Average RHR continued its reduction to 47.4 bpm, significantly lower than 2018 and 2020 data (two-sample t-tests).
*   **2022 (through April):** Average RHR reached 45.7 bpm, significantly lower than the starting point in 2018 and also significantly lower than 2021.

This consistent reduction in RHR resists the age-related increase typically observed in individuals chronologically aged 20 to 50 years. Given the speaker's chronological age (49, turning 50 next year), an increase in RHR would be expected. The current RHR trends suggest a more youthful cardiovascular state.

### Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
The speaker's HRV progress showed an overall increase with a temporary regression:
*   **2018:** Average daily HRV was 47.3 milliseconds (ms).
*   **2019:** HRV significantly increased compared to 2018 (two-sample t-test).
*   **2020:** HRV further increased to 57.8 ms. This was significantly higher than 2018, but not statistically significantly higher than 2019.
*   **2021:** HRV regressed to 51.9 ms. While still higher than the 2018 starting point, it was significantly lower than the 2020 data.
*   **2022 (through April):** HRV recovered to an average of 54.3 ms, significantly higher than both 2018 and 2021 data, indicating a reversal of the 2021 decline.

The speaker's current average daily HRV of 54.3 ms is notably higher than the expected median HRV of approximately 35 ms for their chronological age. This places the speaker's HRV at the high end for their age group, or even comparable to the median HRV of someone 17 years younger. Combined with the low RHR, this suggests a state of cardiovascular youth.

## Factors Influencing RHR and HRV

### Body Weight
The speaker tracked average monthly body weight, recorded daily in a fasted state after morning elimination, to minimize variability.
*   The speaker started with a body weight of nearly 160 pounds and is currently around 152 pounds.
*   **Relationship with RHR:** Monthly trends show that as body weight declines, RHR also declines, and vice-versa. Analysis of individual data points revealed a significant positive correlation: as body weight increases, RHR significantly increases. Conversely, as body weight approaches 150 pounds, RHR approaches 45 bpm.
*   **Relationship with HRV:** While there's more variability in HRV data, individual data points show a significant negative correlation: as body weight increases, HRV significantly decreases. Conversely, as body weight approaches 150 pounds, HRV approaches youthful levels of 60 ms.

**Conclusion on Body Weight:** Decreases in body weight lead to RHR and HRV values that approach youthful levels.

### Physical Activity (Average Daily Heart Rate)
Average daily heart rate (collected from WHOOP data and manually logged) serves as an index of daily physical activity and overall stress.
*   **Higher Average Daily Heart Rate** -> More physical activity + More overall stress.
*   **Lower Average Daily Heart Rate** -> Less physical activity + Less overall stress.

*   **Correlation with Next-Day RHR:** Over 760 days of data (April 2020 - April 2022) showed a significant positive correlation: higher daily activity (higher average daily heart rate) leads to an increased next-morning RHR. This suggests that too much daily activity, too often, may negatively impact RHR.
*   **Correlation with Next-Day HRV:** The same data set revealed a significant negative correlation: as daily activity increases, next-morning HRV significantly decreases. This suggests that excessive or insufficiently recovered daily activity may be detrimental to HRV.

**Optimizing Activity and Rest:** Finding the right balance between activity and rest days is crucial for optimizing RHR and HRV. The speaker currently follows a 3-day cycle:

1.  **Day 1:** High activity day (indicated by average daily heart rate)
2.  **Day 2:** Medium activity day (lower average daily heart rate)
3.  **Day 3:** Relatively lower average daily heart rate
4.  **Day 4:** Repeat cycle

## Combined Impact of Activity and Body Weight on CV Metrics

Multivariate models were constructed to assess the combined explanatory power of average daily heart rate (physical activity) and body weight on RHR and HRV.

*   **Impact on RHR:** The combination of average daily physical activity and body weight is significantly associated with RHR. These two metrics explain 26% of the variability in RHR. This leaves 74% of RHR variability to be explained by other factors, such as diet.
*   **Impact on HRV:** The combination of average daily physical activity and body weight is also significantly associated with HRV. However, these two metrics only explain 5% of the variability in HRV. This indicates that 95% of HRV variability is influenced by other, yet-to-be-identified factors, suggesting a greater complexity in optimizing HRV.
