# 2020-05-03 Optimizing Biological Age - Dr. Michael Lustgarten

## Executive Summary

*   **Phenotypic Age as a Biomarker:** Phenotypic age, calculated from nine clinical variables, is a strong predictor of biological age and is highly correlated with chronological age (r=0.94-0.96).
*   **Mortality Risk:** For every one-year increase in phenotypic age, all-cause mortality risk increases by 9%. This association holds across different age groups and is linked to disease-specific mortality for most major causes.
*   **Optimizing Biomarkers:** Individualized tracking of diet and blood biomarkers is crucial for identifying optimal ranges and making targeted dietary changes. This approach can lead to a significant reduction in biological age over time.
*   **Albumin and Glucose as Key Indicators:** Higher albumin levels and lower glucose levels are associated with biological youth and reduced all-cause mortality risk. Beta-carotene intake shows a moderate correlation with higher albumin, while saturated fat intake correlates with higher glucose levels.
*   **Inflammation and Kidney Function:** Lower C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and optimized creatinine levels are crucial for longevity. While CRP should be as close to zero as possible, maintaining creatinine within a specific narrow range (e.g., 0.6-1.1 mg/dL) is associated with the lowest mortality risk.

## Phenotypic Age: A Measure of Biological Age

Phenotypic age is calculated using nine clinical variables plus chronological age as the tenth variable. These include:

*   Albumin
*   Creatinine
*   Serum glucose
*   C-reactive protein (CRP)
*   Lymphocyte percentage (of total white blood cells)
*   Mean corpuscular volume (MCV)
*   Red blood cell distribution width (RDW)
*   Alkaline phosphatase
*   White blood cell count

The Phenotypic Age calculator has a high correlation with chronological age, with correlation coefficients of 0.94 in the NHANES dataset and 0.96 in the Haines IV dataset. This is comparable to the epigenetic clock (correlation of 0.97).

### Importance of Phenotypic Age

*   **All-Cause Mortality:** Each one-year increase in phenotypic age is associated with a 9% increase in all-cause mortality risk. This association is consistent across young, middle-aged, and older adults.
*   **Disease-Specific Mortality:** Phenotypic age is associated with an increased risk of death from heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease, diabetes, influenza/pneumonia, and nephritis. Cerebral vascular disease was the exception in the Haines IV study.

### Calculating and Optimizing Phenotypic Age

*   **Cost-Effective:** The clinical tests required for phenotypic age calculation are relatively inexpensive compared to other biological age measures like epigenetic clocks.
*   **Individualized Approach:** While epidemiological studies provide general trends, Dr. Lustgarten emphasizes the importance of rigorous blood testing and dietary tracking to identify personal diet patterns that optimize individual biomarkers. This involves weighing food, tracking macro- and micronutrients, and correlating dietary intake with blood test results.

## Individual Biomarker Analysis and Optimization

### Albumin

*   **Age-Related Trend:** Albumin levels decrease with age in both sexes.
*   **Mortality Risk:** Levels above 45 g/L (men) and 44 g/L (women) are associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality. Decreasing albumin levels are linked to increasing mortality risk.
*   **Optimization:** Dr. Lustgarten observed an increase in his albumin levels from 4.74 mg/dL to 4.93 mg/dL through dietary tracking. Beta-carotene intake (from carrots, sweet potatoes, red bell peppers, spinach, parsley) showed a moderate correlation (r=0.6) with higher albumin levels, with a target intake of around 60 mg for optimal levels.

### Glucose

*   **Age-Related Trend:** Glucose levels generally increase with age, particularly linearly in women and plateauing around age 60 in men.
*   **Mortality Risk:** The optimal range for lowest all-cause mortality risk is 80-94 mg/dL. Levels below 80 mg/dL or above 94 mg/dL are associated with significantly increased mortality risk.
*   **Optimization:** Dr. Lustgarten maintained his average blood glucose level at 87.7 mg/dL, resisting age-related increases. Fat intake, particularly saturated fat, showed a strong positive correlation (r=0.75) with his blood glucose levels.

### C-Reactive Protein (CRP)

*   **Age-Related Trend:** CRP levels increase with age in both men and women.
*   **Mortality Risk:** Lower CRP levels are associated with lower all-cause mortality risk. Levels below 1 mg/L, and ideally below 0.33 mg/L, are associated with the lowest risk.
*   **Optimization:** Dr. Lustgarten noted a negative correlation between his average daily fat intake (especially saturated fat from coconut butter and cocoa beans) and CRP levels, suggesting a potential strategy for lowering CRP. However, this needs to be balanced with other biomarker implications (e.g., glucose).

### Creatinine

*   **Age-Related Trend:** Creatinine levels increase with age, reflecting a decline in kidney function (estimated by eGFR).
*   **Mortality Risk:** The optimal range for lowest all-cause mortality risk is around 0.8 mg/dL, with ranges of 0.6 to 1.1 mg/dL considered tighter and associated with reduced risk.
*   **Optimization:** Dr. Lustgarten successfully reduced his creatinine levels from an average of 1.11 mg/dL to lower values through dietary changes. Increased intake of eggs and cheese was correlated with higher creatinine levels, leading to a reduction in these foods.

### Lymphocyte Percentage

*   **Age-Related Trend:** Lymphocyte percentage generally decreases with age in men. In women, it shows more variability, decreasing in the 30s, increasing in the 50s, and decreasing again later in life.
*   **Mortality Risk:** The lowest risk for all-cause mortality is associated with lymphocyte counts between 2,000 and 2,600 cells/µL. Too low or too high levels increase mortality risk.
*   **Optimization:** Specific dietary correlations for Dr. Lustgarten were not yet established, but maintaining optimal lymphocyte levels is crucial, especially given their role in immune function.

### Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)

*   **Age-Related Trend:** MCV, representing the average size of red blood cells, increases with age.
*   **Mortality Risk:** Lower MCVs, found in biological youth, are associated with a lower risk of all-cause death.
*   **Optimization:** Lower MCV values are considered better.

### Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW)

*   **Age-Related Trend:** RDW, indicating the variation in red blood cell size, increases with age.
*   **Mortality Risk:** Lower RDW values (less than 12-12.5%) are associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality.
*   **Optimization:** Dr. Lustgarten found a moderate correlation between his daily calorie intake and RDW. Targeting around 2,400-2,500 calories is suggested for RDWs below 12.5%. Fructose intake also showed a moderate correlation with higher RDW, suggesting that reducing fructose intake may lower RDW.

### Alkaline Phosphatase

*   **Age-Related Trend:** Alkaline phosphatase levels increase with age.
*   **Mortality Risk:** Mortality risk begins to increase significantly after approximately 48 units/L. Levels as close to 48 units/L as possible are considered optimal.
*   **Optimization:** Resisting age-related increases in alkaline phosphatase is recommended.

### White Blood Cells (WBC)

*   **Age-Related Trend:** WBC count increases with age.
*   **Mortality Risk:** The longest life expectancy is associated with WBC counts between 3,500-6,000 cells/µL. Lower (<3,500) and higher (>6,000) counts are associated with shorter life expectancies.
*   **Optimization:** Calorie restriction has been shown to lower WBC counts. Dr. Lustgarten's data suggests WBC counts may be sensitive to calorie intake.

## Key Takeaways for Optimization

*   **Continuous Process:** Optimizing biological age is a continuous trial-and-error process, not a one-time fix.
*   **Individualization:** What works for one person may not work for another. Personalized tracking and analysis are essential.
*   **Diet and Fitness are Pillars:** Diet and fitness are primary drivers for optimizing biomarkers and biological age.
*   **Never Too Late:** It is never too late to start tracking and making positive changes to improve biological age and healthspan.
*   **Gut Microbiome:** While understudied, the gut microbiome plays a significant role in aging and health. Supporting it through a high-fiber, whole-food diet is crucial.
*   **Time-Restricted Feeding:** Eating meals earlier in the day can positively impact sleep quality and metabolic health.

## Future Directions and Research

*   **Rejuvenation Therapies:** The field of rejuvenation technology holds promise for more significant age reversal in the future.
*   **Senolytics:** Research into senescent cells and senolytics is ongoing, but widespread testing for these markers is not yet common.
*   **Machine Learning:** Advanced data analysis techniques like machine learning could further enhance our understanding of complex biomarker-dietary interactions.
