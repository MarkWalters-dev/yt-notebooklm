# 2025-02-23 Calorie Restriction And Fasting Extend Lifespan

## Executive Summary

*   Calorie restriction (CR) and intermittent fasting (IF) interventions can extend lifespan in genetically diverse mice.
*   The effectiveness and outcomes of these interventions may vary based on individual genetic predisposition and baseline body weight.
*   Body weight changes during dietary interventions are complex; while CR and IF cause weight loss, the relationship between weight loss and lifespan is not straightforward and may be secondary to other underlying mechanisms.
*   Biomarkers such as Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) and immune cell populations (lymphocytes, myeloid cells) show strong correlations with lifespan and biological aging, potentially offering insights into healthspan.
*   Genetics plays a significant role in lifespan, but the context of the environment and lifestyle are crucial in determining the impact of specific genes.

## Mouse Data

### Study Design and Interventions

*   **Model:** Genetically diverse outbred (DO) mice, noted for their individual uniqueness and extended lifespans.
*   **Study Duration:** Approximately seven years.
*   **Participants:** 960 female mice.
*   **Dietary Interventions:**
    *   **Ad Libitum (AL):** Mice allowed to eat freely. Baseline average intake was 3.4 grams/day.
    *   **Mild Calorie Restriction (20% CR):** Food intake reduced by 20%.
    *   **Extreme Calorie Restriction (40% CR):** Food intake reduced by 40%, resulting in approximately 2 grams/day. This was administered gradually.
    *   **Intermittent Fasting (1-day IF):** 24 hours of food deprivation per week.
    *   **Intermittent Fasting (2-day IF):** 48 hours of food deprivation per week. This was also administered gradually.

### Feeding Behavior and Metabolism

*   **Compensatory Feeding:** Mice on IF regimens showed compensatory feeding on non-fasting days, often returning to normal or near-normal weekly intake.
*   **Friday Feast (CR Mice):** Mice on CR, particularly 40% CR, experienced a "feast" on Fridays due to logistical scheduling, leading to rapid consumption of their allocated food and subsequent multi-day deprivation. This suggests that 40% CR mice also engaged in intermittent fasting behaviors.
*   **Metabolic Rate (Respiratory Quotient - RQ):**
    *   40% CR mice exhibited significant daily rhythmicity in their fuel source utilization, switching between burning carbohydrates (high RQ) and fat (low RQ), suggesting "metabolic exercise."
    *   RQ plummeted during food deprivation periods.
    *   The magnitude of RQ fluctuations within individual mice did not predict lifespan.
*   **Energy Expenditure and Activity:**
    *   40% CR mice, despite appearing to have low energy, consistently ran on exercise wheels, even during daytime rest periods, indicating food-seeking behavior due to hunger.
    *   Mice on CR generally displayed lower energy levels and were colder.

### Body Weight and Lifespan

*   **Body Weight Changes:**
    *   AL mice gained weight throughout adulthood.
    *   1-day IF mice lost weight despite similar weekly caloric intake to AL mice.
    *   20% CR and 2-day IF mice showed consistent weight loss.
    *   40% CR mice experienced rapid and sustained weight loss, reaching significantly low levels and remaining in negative energy balance.
*   **Lifespan Extension:**
    *   **Median Lifespan:**
        *   AL mice: ~25 months.
        *   40% CR mice: ~34 months (9 months longer than AL).
        *   20% CR and IF mice also showed lifespan extension.
    *   **Caveats:**
        *   Extreme CR (40%) is not recommended for humans, as it leads to significant discomfort and may not translate to proportional lifespan benefits.
        *   The study focused on female mice; results may differ in males.
*   **Individual Variation:**
    *   Lifespan extension was not uniform; some mice in all intervention groups lived exceptionally long lives, while others did not benefit significantly.
    *   Smaller mice at baseline showed lifespan extension across all interventions.
    *   Intermittent fasting did not extend lifespan on average for heavier mice, suggesting individual response variability.

### Biomarkers and Health Traits

*   **Pheno Delta:** A composite trait (measurements taken during a stressful month-long observation period) that was strongly associated with lifespan. Mice that resisted weight loss during this stressful period lived longer. Resilience to weight loss emerged as a key indicator of long lifespan across all diets.
*   **Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW):**
    *   High RDW is a strong predictor of shorter lifespan in mice, mirroring observations in humans.
    *   RDW increased significantly in mice on 2-day IF and 40% CR at 10 months of age, despite these interventions extending lifespan. This indicates that interventions can adversely affect red blood cells while still promoting longevity.
    *   When plotted against "proportion of life lived" (biological age), RDW showed parallel increases across groups, with a sharp inflection point around 70% of life lived, suggesting a common aging trajectory.
*   **Immune Cell Populations:** Myeloid to lymphoid ratio (ML ratio) was a strong tracker of biological age. 40% CR attenuated the rate of increase in the ML ratio.
*   **Body Fat:** Mice with higher body fat maintained positive association with lifespan, suggesting a role in resilience.
*   **Inflammation:** 40% CR reduced inflammation, although it increased in the final stages of life across all groups.

## Genetics of Longevity

*   **Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS):** Identified loci associated with lifespan and related traits.
*   **Chromosome 18 Locus:** A significant locus on chromosome 18 was strongly associated with lifespan and RDW. This locus alone explained 4.5% of the variance in body weight and contributed significantly to lifespan variation.
*   **Heritability:** Diet explained about 7% of lifespan variance, while body weight explained around 1%. Genetics, particularly the chromosome 18 locus, played a substantial role, with the overall genetic background explaining about 20% of lifespan variation.
*   **Context Specificity:** The effect of genetic variants on lifespan is highly context-dependent, influenced by environmental factors and lifestyle.

## Potential Mechanisms and Future Directions

*   **Resilience:** The ability to maintain physiological stability (e.g., body weight) during stress or deprivation appears to be a key driver of longevity, potentially mediated by intrinsic genetic resilience.
*   **RDW and Chromosome 18:** A working hypothesis suggests the chromosome 18 locus influences RDW, which in turn impacts lifespan.
*   **Infection Resistance:** Future studies aim to investigate whether CR can alter immune system behavior to increase resilience to infections like Pseudomonas.
*   **Reproduction and Lifespan:** Research is planned to examine the effects of female reproduction (pregnancy, lactation) on lifespan and late-life health, particularly immune function.
*   **Genetic Models:** Development of genetic models allowing for replication of genotypes in outbred animals will enable more controlled studies on the interplay of genetics, diet, infection, and reproduction.
*   **Dietary Composition:** Questions remain about the ideal diet composition for aging, including the potential benefits of increased fiber or specific micronutrients.
*   **Biomarker Translation:** Biomarkers like RDW and lymphocyte counts show similar patterns of change in aging mice and humans, suggesting potential for translational research in human healthspan.
*   **Aging as a Malleable Process:** The rate of aging appears to be malleable through interventions like CR, suggesting that it might be possible to influence aging without accumulating all adverse outcomes associated with extreme measures.
