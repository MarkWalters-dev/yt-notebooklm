# 2025-08-17 Attempting To Slow Aging By Optimizing Biomarkers

## Executive Summary

*   The speaker's biological age, calculated using the PhenoAge clock, is currently 36 years, which is 16.5 years younger than their chronological age. Annual average PhenoAge has resisted age-related increases over seven years (2018-2025), remaining around 32-34 years, in contrast to an expected increase to approximately 40 years.
*   A strategy of frequent blood testing (6-8 times per year) is employed to track the *pace* of aging by comparing annual averages of biomarkers, providing a more robust measure than isolated tests.
*   Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW), a significant contributor to PhenoAge, is a crucial biomarker. The optimal range for RDW, associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk in a study of 3.4 million people, is 11.4 to 12.6.
*   The speaker's RDW has shown an inverse correlation with age over ten years (2015-2025), with values decreasing and moving into the optimal range, counteracting the typical age-related increase in RDW.
*   The overall goal is to maintain RDW and other key biomarkers within their optimal ranges and resist age-related changes indefinitely, aiming to flatten all-cause mortality risk rather than "reverse aging."

## Biological Age Tracking

The speaker's current biological age, calculated using Dr. Morgan Levine's PhenoAge calculator, is 36 years. This is 16.5 years younger than their chronological age. A younger biological age relative to chronological age, as indicated by this test, is associated with a significantly reduced risk of death from all causes. The extent to which this translates into extended lifespan is currently unknown.

A total of 63 blood tests have been conducted since 2015, averaging about six tests per year. This frequent testing approach is used to establish a more accurate "pace of aging" by averaging biomarker data over an entire year, rather than relying on single, potentially unrepresentative measurements.

### Year-to-Year PhenoAge Averages (2018-2025)

The PhenoAge calculator requires high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) data, which the speaker began including in blood tests in 2018. Over 42 tests from 2018 to 2025:

*   **2018-2019 (3 tests):** Average biological age was 34.3 years.
*   **2020-2021 (12 tests, 6 per year):** Average biological age was 33.9 years for each year.
*   **2022 (7 tests):** Average biological age was 32.1 years (the best year to date).
*   **2023 (7 tests):** Average biological age was 32.9 years.
*   **2024 (8 tests):** Average biological age was 33.1 years.
*   **2025 (current average from 5 tests):** 32.6 years (the most recent test was 36 years, which is the highest in 2025, while earlier 2025 tests were 20-22 years younger than chronological age).

Over this seven-year period, the speaker has resisted an age-related increase in biological age. The PhenoAge model predicts that biological age increases by 0.9 years for every year of chronological age, even if all biomarkers remain constant. Starting with an average biological age of 34 years in 2018, the expected biological age in 2025 would be approximately 40 years. The current average of 32.6 years indicates an improvement in some of the biomarkers comprising the PhenoAge test, potentially slowing the biomarker aging rate.

## Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW)

Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) is a significant contributor to the PhenoAge calculation and a key biomarker for assessing the pace of aging. RDW measures the variability in the volume and size of red blood cells.

*   **Low RDW:** Indicates red blood cells are relatively uniform in volume and size.
*   **High RDW:** Indicates a greater variability in red blood cell volume and size.

### Optimal RDW Range and Trends

A study of 3.4 million people identified optimal RDW ranges associated with all-cause mortality risk:

*   **Lowest All-Cause Mortality Risk:** 11.4 to 12.6.
*   **Increased All-Cause Mortality Risk:**
    *   Greater than 13.7.
    *   Less than 11.4 (a very rare occurrence).

The speaker's RDW data, tracked over 59 tests from 2015 to 2025, initially showed most values in a suboptimal range. However, RDW has declined during aging, demonstrating a significant inverse correlation with age (correlation coefficient: -0.65, p < 0.05). This trend is contrary to the typical age-related increase in RDW. While most recent data points fall within the optimal range, recent tests have shown RDW moving in an undesirable direction, emphasizing the importance of tracking the overall trend rather than isolated measurements.

## Overall Strategy and Conclusions

The goal is to maintain RDW and all other biomarkers within their optimal ranges and to resist age-related changes indefinitely, aiming for a flattened all-cause mortality risk. This approach seeks to slow the biomarker aging rate, rather than "reverse aging," which is considered a misnomer in the current context. By keeping biomarkers stable and optimal over time, the objective is to maintain organ systems at a functionally younger state.
