# 2023-08-23 Increase NAD With Fish Oil And Other PUFA-Containing Fatty Acids Hypothesis.

## Executive Summary

*   NAD levels decline during aging, accompanied by increased tryptophan conversion to kynurenine and quinolinic acid, suggesting an age-related block in the de novo NAD synthesis pathway, potentially at the quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (QAPRT) step.
*   Clofibric acid, a fibrate and PPAR alpha activator, was shown to increase QAPRT activity and liver NAD levels in rats.
*   Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including alpha-linolenic acid, linoleic acid, gamma-linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid, demonstrated PPAR alpha activation in vitro.
*   Fish oil fatty acids, EPA and DHA, also activated PPAR alpha in vitro, with DHA showing the strongest activation, exceeding the gold standard WY14643.
*   Circulating levels of DHA, EPA, linolenate, and arachidonate decline significantly with age, correlating with reduced NAD levels.

## Background on NAD Synthesis and Aging

During aging, the de novo NAD synthesis pathway becomes dysfunctional. NAD and tryptophan levels decline, while kynurenine and quinolinic acid levels increase. This suggests an attempted increase in flux through the de novo pathway but an age-related block, likely in the conversion of quinolinic acid to NAD by quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (QAPRT).

The de novo pathway involves:
Tryptophan -> Kynurenine -> Quinolinic Acid -> (QAPRT) -> NAMN -> NAD

Fortunately, backup pathways exist for increasing NAD:
*   **Price handler pathway:** Nicotinic acid (NA) is converted to NAMN, then to NAD.
*   **Salvage pathway:** Niacinamide (NAM), NMN, and NR are converted to NAD.

However, these backup pathways do not address the age-related problem in the de novo synthesis.

## Hypothesis: Increasing QAPRT Activity Via PPAR Alpha Activation

This hypothesis explores increasing NAD by enhancing QAPRT activity, specifically through activators of Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Alpha (PPAR alpha).

### Clofibric Acid and QAPRT Activity

*   Clofibrate, a lipid-lowering drug and a PPAR alpha activator, was studied in rats.
*   Rats fed 0.25% clofibrate in their diet for two weeks showed an approximate doubling of QAPRT activity in the liver.
*   Concurrently, liver NAD levels approximately doubled in the clofibrate-treated rats compared to controls.

### PPAR Alpha and its Activators

PPAR alpha is a nuclear receptor that induces gene expression when activated. One such gene is FGF21, whose overexpression is linked to increased lifespan in mice. Crucially, PPAR alpha also activates QAPRT.

Activators of PPAR alpha include:
*   **Fibrates:** Clofibrate and ciprofibrate.
    *   Clofibrate demonstrated a 16-fold activation of PPAR alpha in vitro.
    *   Ciprofibrate showed approximately 21-fold activation of PPAR alpha.
*   **WY14643:** A gold standard activator, demonstrating a 26-fold induction of PPAR alpha activation in vitro.
*   **Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs):** These can be obtained from the diet and activate PPAR alpha.

### PUFAs and PPAR Alpha Activation (In Vitro)

*   **Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA):** Showed about a 15-fold induction of PPAR alpha activation. Foods rich in ALA include flaxseeds and chia seeds.
*   **Other PUFAs:** Linoleic acid, gamma-linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid showed 10-12 fold PPAR alpha activation.
*   **Saturated Fatty Acids (SFAs):** Including short and medium-chain SFAs (C8-C14), showed no or weak PPAR alpha activation.
    *   Stearic acid (C16) also had minimal impact on PPAR alpha activation.

### Fish Oil Fatty Acids and PPAR Alpha Activation (In Vitro)

*   **EPA:** Demonstrated approximately a 4.5-fold increase in PPAR alpha activity (92% activation).
*   **DHA:** Showed the strongest activation among the PUFAs tested, with about a 7-fold increase in PPAR alpha activity (above basal levels), even exceeding the activation by WY14643.

### Age-Related Decline in PUFA Levels

Circulating levels of DHA, EPA, linolenate, and arachidonate were found to be significantly lower in 97-year-old individuals compared to 67-year-old individuals. This decline suggests a potential link between aging, reduced PUFA levels, and impaired PPAR alpha activity.

## Personal Hypothesis and Future Testing

The current hypothesis is that increasing dietary intake of PUFAs, particularly those found in fish oil (EPA and DHA) and ALA-rich sources, can activate PPAR alpha, thereby potentially increasing QAPRT activity and consequently NAD levels.

To test this hypothesis:
1.  Increase dietary intake of ALA (from sources like flaxseeds and chia seeds).
2.  Increase dietary intake of fish oil (EPA and DHA).
3.  Measure NAD levels via a blood sample sent to Ginfinity in September 2023.

The strategy involves reducing intake of SFAs (like those from coconut butter) and stearic acid (from cocoa beans) slightly, while increasing ALA intake. The effect of fish oil fatty acids will be tested in conjunction with ALA.
