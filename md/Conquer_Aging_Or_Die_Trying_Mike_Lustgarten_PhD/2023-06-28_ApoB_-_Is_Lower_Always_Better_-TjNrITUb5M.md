# 2023-06-28 ApoB - Is Lower Always Better

## Executive Summary

*   Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) is a component of non-HDL cholesterol, including LDL, VLDL, IDL, and lipoprotein(a), and may be a superior marker for coronary heart disease (CHD) and dementia risk compared to LDL cholesterol.
*   Higher ApoB levels are significantly associated with increased CHD risk and all-cause dementia risk.
*   In individuals aged 39-59 years, high ApoB is associated with increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk, supporting the idea that lower ApoB may be beneficial in this age group.
*   In individuals aged 60-79 years, while high ApoB is linked to increased mortality, very low ApoB levels (<1.06 g/L) are associated with a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   In individuals older than 79 years, very low ApoB levels (<1.06 g/L) are also associated with a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk, suggesting that lower is not always better for ApoB in older age groups.

## Introduction to ApoB

Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) is a protein found in non-HDL cholesterol particles. It is a key component of:
*   Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
*   Intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL)
*   Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)
*   Lipoprotein(a)

ApoB is not found in High-density lipoprotein (HDL); HDL contains ApoA1.

## ApoB as a Biomarker for Disease Risk

### Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Risk

*   A study involving approximately 441,000 people compared the odds ratio of CHD for LDL cholesterol and ApoB.
*   **LDL Cholesterol:** The confidence interval for LDL cholesterol overlapped with the hazard ratio of one, indicating no significant association with CHD risk in this study.
*   **ApoB:** The confidence interval for ApoB was completely above one, signifying a significantly higher risk for CHD associated with relatively higher ApoB levels.

### Dementia Risk

*   A study of approximately 469,000 people investigated the association between ApoB, LDL cholesterol, and all-cause dementia risk (including Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and other dementias).
*   **ApoB:** In individuals with relatively higher ApoB levels, the confidence interval was completely above the hazard ratio of one, indicating a significant association with increased all-cause dementia risk.
*   **LDL Cholesterol:** The confidence interval for LDL cholesterol overlapped with the hazard ratio of one, showing no significant association with all-cause dementia risk.

These findings suggest that relatively lower ApoB levels may be more beneficial for health, particularly concerning cardiovascular and neurological health.

## ApoB and All-Cause Mortality Risk: Is Lower Always Better?

This section examines the relationship between ApoB levels and mortality risk across different age groups.

### Age Group: 39-59 Years

*   A study involving approximately 94,000 people assessed cardiovascular mortality risk and all-cause mortality risk in relation to ApoB levels. The reference ApoB range was 1.24-1.39 g/L.
*   **Higher ApoB Levels ( > 1.4 g/L):** Associated with significantly increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk. The confidence intervals were completely above the hazard ratio of one.
*   **Lower ApoB Levels ( < 1.23 g/L):** No significant impact on cardiovascular or all-cause mortality risk was observed.

**Conclusion for 39-59 year olds:** Relatively high ApoB is significantly associated with increased mortality risk. Lower ApoB levels appear to be beneficial in this age group.

### Age Group: 60-79 Years

*   The same study design was used for this age group, with the same reference range for ApoB.
*   **Higher ApoB Levels:** Significantly associated with increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk, with confidence intervals above the hazard ratio of one.
*   **Lower ApoB Levels ( < 1.23 g/L):** No impact on cardiovascular mortality risk was observed.
*   **Very Low ApoB Levels ( < 1.06 g/L):** A significantly increased all-cause mortality risk was observed, arguing against the "lower is always better" hypothesis for ApoB in this age group.

**Conclusion for 60-79 year olds:** While high ApoB is detrimental, very low ApoB levels are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.

### Age Group: Older than 79 Years ( > 80 Years)

*   Data for individuals older than 80 years were also analyzed.
*   **Higher ApoB Levels:** Not significantly associated with mortality risk (cardiovascular or all-cause) at any level.
*   **Very Low ApoB Levels ( < 1.06 g/L):** A significantly increased all-cause mortality risk was observed when compared to the hazard ratio of one.

**Conclusion for > 79 year olds:** Very low ApoB levels are associated with a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk.

## Overall Conclusions

*   For individuals **younger than 60 years**, lower ApoB levels appear to be beneficial for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk.
*   For individuals **older than 60 years**, very low ApoB levels may be associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk, suggesting that "lower is always better" may not hold true in older populations.
