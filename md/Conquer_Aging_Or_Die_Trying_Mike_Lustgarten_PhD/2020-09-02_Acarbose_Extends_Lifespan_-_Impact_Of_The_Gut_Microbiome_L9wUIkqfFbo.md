# 2020-09-02 Acarbose Extends Lifespan - Impact Of The Gut Microbiome

### Executive Summary
*   **Microbiome's Role in Lifespan:** Germ-free mice (without a gut microbiome) consistently exhibit extended lifespans compared to wild-type mice, suggesting a significant role for the microbiome in longevity.
*   **Acarbose Extends Lifespan:** The drug Acarbose, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, significantly increases lifespan in genetically heterogeneous mice, with a more pronounced effect in males (up to 22% increase in median lifespan) than in females (up to 5%).
*   **Mechanism of Acarbose:** Acarbose inhibits sugar-degrading enzymes in the small intestine, reducing glucose absorption into the bloodstream. This leads to more undigested carbohydrates reaching the colon.
*   **Role of Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs):** In the colon, undigested carbohydrates are fermented by gut bacteria into SCFAs (acetate, propionate, butyrate). Acarbose treatment is associated with increased fecal propionate and butyrate, and modeling suggests these increases contribute to lifespan extension.
*   **Human Relevance:** High-fiber diets and exercise training increase fecal SCFA levels in humans, providing potential lifestyle interventions to modulate the gut microbiome and potentially impact longevity.

## Mouse Data: Evidence for Microbiome's Role in Lifespan

Studies on germ-free mice demonstrate a consistent link between the absence of a microbiome and increased lifespan.

*   **Swiss Webster Mice:**
    *   Wild-type animals with a microbiome had an average lifespan of 15-17 months and a maximum lifespan of 26-28 months.
    *   Germ-free Swiss Webster mice (grown in a bubble) showed significantly increased lifespan for both females and males. Average lifespan increased to 23-24 months, and maximum lifespan increased to 33-39 months.
*   **C57 Black 6 Mice:**
    *   Germ-free female C57 Black 6 mice showed a higher proportion of animals alive at 600 days compared to wild-type animals with a microbiome.
*   **ICR Mice:**
    *   Male germ-free ICR mice lived significantly longer (89 weeks average lifespan) compared to specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice with a microbiome (76 weeks average lifespan).
    *   Interestingly, maximum lifespan was not significantly different between germ-free and SPF ICR mice in this study.

These findings, replicated across different genetic backgrounds and studies, indicate that the gut microbiome plays a role in influencing host lifespan.

## Acarbose Extends Lifespan in Mice

Identifying microbiome-derived factors that affect lifespan is more practical than living in a germ-free environment. Acarbose is a supplement known to increase lifespan and corresponding fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).

*   **Study 1 (Genetically Heterogeneous Mice, Pooled Data from 3 Study Sites):**
    *   **Male Mice:** Acarbose supplementation significantly increased median lifespan by 22% compared to control-fed animals.
    *   **Female Mice:** Acarbose supplementation resulted in a smaller but significant 5% increase in median lifespan.
*   **Study 2 (Genetically Heterogeneous Mice, Pooled Data from 3 Study Sites):**
    *   **Female Mice:** Acarbose supplementation increased median lifespan by 4-5% at medium and high doses. Maximum lifespan increased by 3% only at the highest Acarbose dose.
    *   **Male Mice:** Acarbose supplementation showed a larger effect, increasing median lifespan by 16-17% at medium and high doses, and maximum lifespan by 8-11%.

These studies clearly demonstrate that Acarbose extends lifespan, with a more pronounced effect in male mice than in female mice.

## Mechanism of Acarbose Action

Acarbose exerts its effects by inhibiting alpha-glucosidase, an enzyme found in the small intestine.

**Normal Disaccharide Digestion:**
Food (containing disaccharides like maltose, sucrose)
  -> Disaccharides reach Small Intestine
  -> Alpha-glucosidase degrades disaccharides (e.g., maltose -> glucose; sucrose -> glucose + fructose)
  -> Monosaccharides (glucose, fructose) are absorbed into the blood from the small intestine

**Acarbose Action:**
Acarbose
  -> Inhibits Alpha-glucosidase in the Small Intestine
  -> Reduced degradation of disaccharides and other polysaccharides
  -> Reduced absorption of sugars (glucose, fructose) into the blood from the small intestine
  -> More undigested carbohydrates reach the colon

*   **Impact on Blood Glucose:**
    *   **Male Mice:** Acarbose treatment significantly reduced post-meal blood glucose levels, consistent with reduced sugar absorption.
    *   **Female Mice:** Acarbose supplementation did not significantly decrease blood glucose concentrations. This difference in glucose response between sexes may contribute to the observed sex-specific effects on lifespan, suggesting other factors might be more influential in female mice.

Since Acarbose reduces sugar absorption in the small intestine, it logically follows that more undigested carbohydrates would reach the large intestine (colon) where they can be fermented by gut bacteria.

## Role of Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)

Non-absorbed carbohydrates that reach the large intestine are fermented by gut bacteria into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).

**SCFA Production Pathway:**
Non-absorbed Carbohydrates (e.g., cellulose, fructans, starch, xylans, gums, pectins)
  -> Reach Colon
  -> Fermented by Colonic Bacteria
  -> Produces Short-Chain Fatty Acids (Butyrate, Propionate, Acetate)
  -> SCFAs are absorbed by colonic epithelial cells (for energy) or absorbed into the blood (for systemic physiological impact)

*   **Acarbose and Fecal SCFAs:**
    *   Studies showing Acarbose-mediated lifespan extension also found increases in fecal levels of propionate and butyrate.
    *   Modeling suggested that these higher SCFA levels were associated with the observed longevity.
    *   A modeled 5-10% increase in median lifespan was associated with approximately doubled concentrations of propionate and butyrate in fecal samples.

*   **Fiber Intervention in Rats (Oligofructose-Enriched Inulin):**
    *   **Protocol:** Rats were fed oligofructose-enriched inulin, a type of fiber that gut bacteria ferment into SCFAs.
    *   **Survival:** Rats fed this fiber showed increased survival.
        *   Male rats: Significantly more fiber-fed rats were alive at 18 and 24 months compared to control-fed animals.
        *   Female rats: Significantly more fiber-fed rats were alive at 24 months compared to control-fed animals.
    *   **SCFA Levels:** Feeding oligofructose-enriched inulin to rats significantly increased cecal (large intestine) levels of acetate, propionate, and butyrate.
    *   **Conclusion:** This direct intervention, where the fiber is fermented solely by gut bacteria, provides strong evidence for the role of gut bacteria and SCFAs in increased lifespan.

## Human Evidence: Increasing SCFAs

It is possible to increase SCFA levels in humans through dietary and lifestyle interventions.

*   **High-Fiber Diet in Young Subjects:**
    *   **Protocol:** Subjects consumed diets with varying fiber content (25g, 45.4g, and 150g per day).
    *   **Results:** Fecal SCFA output (formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate) increased proportionally with dietary fiber content.
        *   Doubling fiber intake (from 25g to 45.4g) approximately doubled total fecal SCFAs.
        *   A six-fold increase in fiber intake (from 25g to 150g) resulted in an almost six-fold increase in total fecal SCFAs, with acetate levels increasing from approximately 8 mmol to 50 mmol.

*   **Exercise Training in Young Subjects:**
    *   **Protocol:** Sedentary subjects underwent six weeks of treadmill training.
    *   **Results:** Fecal levels of acetate, propionate, and butyrate increased in lean subjects (BMI < 25) after six weeks of exercise training.
    *   **Note:** Obese subjects (BMI > 30) did not show increased fecal SCFA levels in response to exercise training.

These findings suggest that increasing SCFA production through a high-fiber diet and regular exercise may be a viable strategy to modulate the gut microbiome and potentially impact lifespan in humans.
