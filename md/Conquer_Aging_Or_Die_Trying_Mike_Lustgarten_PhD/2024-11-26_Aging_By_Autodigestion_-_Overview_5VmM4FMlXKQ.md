# 2024-11-26 Aging By Autodigestion - Overview

## Executive Summary

*   The mucin layer of the intestine normally protects the body by preventing food digestion in the lumen.
*   Breakdown of this protective barrier allows digestive enzymes to escape the intestinal lumen.
*   Escaped digestive enzymes can enter the bloodstream and lymphatic system.
*   Enzymes entering the lymphatic system bypass the liver and can appear directly in the extracellular fluid.
*   Systemic circulation of digestive enzymes leads to multiorgan dysfunction.

## Autodigestion and Barrier Function

Under normal physiological conditions, ingested food is digested within the lumen of the intestine. This process is strictly contained by an intact mucin layer, which acts as a protective barrier.

If this protective barrier is compromised, leading to autodigestion, a cascade of events is initiated:

1.  **Barrier Breakdown:** The mucin layer is digested away, allowing digestive enzymes to escape the intestinal lumen.
2.  **Enzyme Escape Pathways:**
    *   Digestive enzymes can enter the bloodstream.
    *   Digestive enzymes can enter the lymphatic system.
3.  **Lymphatic Bypass:** Enzymes that enter the lymphatic system bypass the liver.
4.  **Extracellular Fluid Entry:** These enzymes can then cross the entire wall of the small intestine and appear in the extracellular fluid.

## Systemic Effects of Autodigestion

The escape of digestive enzymes into the systemic circulation leads to widespread effects:

*   **Systemic Circulation Impact:** The bloodstream becomes affected by the presence of digestive enzymes.
*   **Multiorgan Dysfunction:** This systemic exposure results in dysfunction across multiple organs.

**Process Visualization: Enzyme Escape**

Intestinal Lumen (Food Digestion) -> Mucin Layer (Barrier) -> **Barrier Breakdown** -> Digestive Enzymes Escape ->
*   Blood Vessels -> Systemic Circulation -> Multiorgan Dysfunction
*   Lymphatics -> Bypass Liver -> Extracellular Fluid -> Systemic Circulation -> Multiorgan Dysfunction
