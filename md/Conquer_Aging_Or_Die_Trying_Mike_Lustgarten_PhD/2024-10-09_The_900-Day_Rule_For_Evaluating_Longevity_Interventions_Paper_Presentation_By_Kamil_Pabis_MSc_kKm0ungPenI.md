# 2024-10-09 The 900-Day Rule For Evaluating Longevity Interventions Paper Presentation By Kamil Pabis MSc

## Executive Summary

*   The lifespan of control mice in longevity studies is critical for interpreting intervention results; shorter-lived controls can mask or exaggerate the effects of interventions.
*   A proposed "900-day rule" suggests that well-housed Black Six and Hsd mice should ideally live up to approximately 900 days to ensure robust study outcomes.
*   Interventions consistently extending lifespan beyond this 900-day benchmark in control groups are more likely to be genuinely pro-longevity.
*   Statistical artifacts, particularly regression to the mean, can significantly influence observed lifespan extensions and must be accounted for in study design and analysis.
*   The 900-day rule provides a benchmark for prioritizing promising interventions and can be conceptually translated to human longevity prospects.

## Background and Motivation

The lifespan of control animals in longevity studies is a crucial factor in interpreting the efficacy of interventions. Studies with short-lived control groups may lead to misleading conclusions, either by exaggerating the effects of a treatment or by masking a genuine benefit. This paper proposes the "900-day rule" as a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of mouse lifespan studies.

## The 900-Day Rule Explained

### Analogy to Human Lifespans

To understand the principle, consider human lifespans across different countries:

*   **Nigeria:** Low life expectancy, likely due to poverty and infectious diseases, not necessarily accelerated aging.
*   **United States:** Moderate life expectancy (around 77 years), impacted by drug-related deaths and obesity, indicating potential for improvement by addressing premature mortality.
*   **Singapore:** Higher life expectancy, with individuals living closer to the biological limit and more likely to die from age-related diseases. Improvements here are more directly related to longevity.

This analogy highlights that extending lifespan in a population already living close to its biological maximum is a more significant indicator of effective longevity interventions than extending lifespan in a population suffering from high rates of premature mortality.

### Theoretical Framework

There is a species- and strain-specific biological limit for lifespan. Optimal husbandry practices lead to survival curves that are more "rectangular," with individuals dying closer to the species-specific median lifespan. This compresses morbidity and indicates that aging is being slowed, rather than just premature mortality being reduced.

### Empirical Evidence from Model Organisms

Observations in various model organisms and human data support this idea:

*   **Humans:** Decreased child mortality and improved health interventions have led to more rectangular human survival curves, bringing populations closer to their maximum potential lifespan.
*   **Mice:** Similar improvements in husbandry and control lifespans are expected to yield more robust longevity study results.

## Factors Influencing Longevity Study Interpretation

### The Impact of Control Lifespan on Intervention Efficacy

Longer-lived control cohorts generally show less dramatic responses to life-extending interventions compared to shorter-lived cohorts. This pattern has been observed across different species and interventions, including calorie restriction.

### Statistical Artifacts: Regression to the Mean

Regression to the mean is a pervasive statistical artifact that can affect any study. It occurs when a sample's value deviates from the population mean; subsequent measurements are likely to be closer to the mean.

*   **Depression Study Example:** Recruiting individuals with high depression scores for a trial. Their scores will likely decrease towards the average over time due to recruitment criteria.
*   **Coin Flip Example:** After a series of heads, the probability of tails on subsequent flips remains 50%, but the average will tend to converge towards the expected value.
*   **Mouse Studies:** If a randomly selected cohort of mice has a shorter-than-average lifespan (e.g., 800 days instead of a 900-day mean), the next cohort is statistically more likely to be closer to the 900-day mean, creating an apparent, but not real, lifespan extension.

## Data Analysis and the 900-Day Rule

### Re-analysis of Calorie Restriction Studies

A re-analysis of classical calorie restriction (CR) studies, including those in mice, flies, and worms, revealed that longer-lived strains responded less effectively to CR. This pattern persisted even after attempting to statistically adjust for regression to the mean.

### Defining the Benchmark for Control Lifespans

Based on extensive data analysis of numerous studies, particularly for widely used strains like **Black Six** and **Hsd** mice:

*   The **optimal median lifespan** for well-housed **Black Six** and **Hsd** mice tends to be around **900 days**.
*   This "900-day rule" serves as a benchmark for robust control groups.
*   Studies where control mice reach this lifespan are considered more reliable.
*   Even if control mice fall short of 900 days, an intervention showing a substantial increase beyond 950 days might still indicate a robust effect, especially when compared to historical controls.

### Strain Specificity

It is important to note that this 900-day benchmark is primarily derived from data on **Black Six** and **Hsd** mice. Other strains may have different optimal lifespans, and the rule may not directly apply to them without adaptation.

## Applying the 900-Day Rule to Interventions

### Reranking Interventions

The 900-day rule can be used to re-evaluate and prioritize potential longevity interventions:

*   **High-Performing Interventions (Meeting or Exceeding Benchmark):**
    *   **Telomerase:** Shows increased lifespan, with treated groups exceeding expected control lifespans.
    *   **Rapamycin:** Consistently extends lifespan in mice, with many studies demonstrating lifespans well above the 900-day benchmark.
    *   **Genetic Interventions:** Mutations in growth hormone signaling pathways (e.g., Little (dwarf) mice, FGF 21 overexpression, Akt2 knockout) can lead to significantly extended lifespans, surpassing the 900-day rule.

*   **Interventions Needing Further Scrutiny (Not Consistently Meeting Benchmark):**
    *   **Metformin:** Many studies show minimal or non-significant lifespan extension, with control lifespans often falling well below the 900-day benchmark, making the data less robust.
    *   **NAD+ Boosters & Securamine:** Some compounds tested in the ITP (Interventions Testing Program) and other studies showed benefits only in shorter-lived animals, failing to meet the 900-day rule.

### Longevity Normalizing vs. Longevity Extending Interventions

The 900-day rule helps differentiate between two types of interventions:

*   **Longevity Normalizing:** These interventions can help an unhealthy cohort reach its natural lifespan by reducing premature mortality (e.g., statins for hyperlipidemia, potentially metformin in overweight individuals).
*   **Longevity Extending:** These interventions go beyond normalizing lifespan and actively slow aging, potentially extending lifespan beyond the species-specific limit (e.g., rapamycin).

## Validation and Predictive Power of the 900-Day Rule

### Consistency Across Studies and Labs

Data from various labs and large-scale studies, such as the Interventions Testing Program (ITP), suggest that control lifespans are often consistent within facilities and across well-conducted studies. This consistency reinforces the validity of establishing benchmarks.

### Predictive Power for Replication

The 900-day rule shows predictive power:

*   **Replication in ITP:** Compounds that met the 900-day rule in non-ITP studies (e.g., NDGA, rapamycin) were more likely to replicate their success in the rigorous ITP studies.
*   Conversely, compounds that only showed benefits in shorter-lived animals (failing the 900-day rule) were less likely to show significant effects in the ITP.

### Trends in Rodent Lifespans

*   **Historical Improvement:** Studies published over the last few decades show a significant improvement in control mouse lifespans, moving from lower ranges towards the 800-900 day mark, indicating progress in husbandry and study design.
*   **Rat Data:** Similar trends of improved control lifespans and a potential ~900-day benchmark are also observed in rat studies, suggesting the applicability of the principle across rodent models.

## Improving Mouse Lifespan Studies

### Key Considerations for Robust Husbandry and Study Design

*   **Healthy Control Animals:** Ensure controls are of healthy weight, well-nourished, and maintained in a low-stress environment.
*   **Environmental Control:** Mice are sensitive to environmental factors like smells (other animals, human hormones). Specific pathogen-free (SPF) facilities are beneficial, but clean, reasonable conditions can also yield good results.
*   **Standardization:** Improve standardization of protocols and euthanasia guidelines across and within facilities. Ethical considerations regarding euthanasia timing are important to ensure mice live as long and healthy as possible.
*   **Sample Size:** While not strictly excluded in the analysis, larger sample sizes (ideally 30-50 mice per group) increase statistical power and reduce the likelihood of outliers impacting results.
*   **Dietary Factors:** While complex, diet composition (e.g., protein restriction, specific amino acid imbalances) can influence lifespan and should be standardized and reported.

### Rewarding Quality Control

*   **Editor and Reader Focus:** Editors and readers should prioritize studies with robust control lifespans.
*   **Incentivizing Quality:** Papers with demonstrably better controls should receive advantages, fostering competition for higher-quality research.
*   **Value of Diverse Strains:** Even if shorter-lived, genetically diverse mouse strains offer valuable insights and should not be disregarded.

## Future Directions and Implications

### Translating to Human Longevity

The 900-day rule has a conceptual translation to humans. Dividing the mouse lifespan by 10 suggests that humans are approaching their biological limit around 90 years. Interventions that significantly extend lifespan in mice beyond 900 days are more likely to be relevant for pushing human longevity boundaries.

### Areas for Further Research

*   **Invertebrate Studies:** Applying similar principles and benchmarks to invertebrate models.
*   **Combination Therapies:** Investigating synergistic effects of multiple interventions.
*   **Non-Chemical Interventions:** Exploring the potential of therapies like red light, heat, and hyperbaric oxygen.
*   **Biomarker-Driven Approaches:** Utilizing biomarkers to tailor interventions to individual needs, especially in human studies.

## Discussion Points and Nuances

### Maximum Lifespan vs. Median Lifespan

While median lifespan is a primary focus of the 900-day rule, maximum lifespan is also a relevant indicator. However, maximum lifespan is statistically harder to estimate and less intuitive.

### Calorie Restriction Nuances

*   The magnitude of CR's effect can vary significantly between strains.
*   Factors like fasting duration, circadian alignment of feeding, and the degree of calorie restriction can independently impact lifespan benefits.

### Diet and Supplementation

*   **Macronutrient Composition:** Plays a role, but often less impact than overall calorie restriction.
*   **Specific Amino Acid Restriction:** Methionine restriction shows promise but has fewer studies compared to CR.
*   **Ketogenic Diets:** Limited evidence for substantial lifespan extension in mice compared to CR.
*   **Popular Supplements:** Berberine, alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) may show effects in shorter-lived strains but do not consistently meet the 900-day rule.
*   **Taurine:** Shows some promise with more robust control lifespans in preliminary studies.
*   **Spermidine:** Promising across multiple studies, but human data is still developing.

### Biomarker-Driven Interventions

*   Using biomarkers to identify metabolic dysfunction (e.g., circulating glucose, visceral fat) can guide personalized interventions.
*   The "skinny-fat" phenotype highlights the complexity of health beyond simple weight.
*   A multimodal approach, targeting specific age-related declines, is likely more effective than single interventions.

### Rapamycin in Humans

*   Anecdotal reports of short lifespans in some long-term rapamycin users are tragic but must be viewed statistically against a large population.
*   The magnitude of rapamycin's effect in humans may be small (around 10%), making it difficult to measure without large-scale studies.
*   A lack of clear, non-invasive biomarkers for rapamycin's mechanisms in humans is a significant challenge.
*   Visceral fat reduction is a potential promising biomarker associated with rapamycin, though further research is needed.

### The Importance of Multimodal Approaches

*   Slowing aging likely requires targeting multiple pathways and using combinations of interventions (diet, exercise, supplements, drugs).
*   Interventions promoting DNA repair and stress resistance are underexplored areas with potential.

### Field Slowdowns and Underrated Aspects

*   **Funding:** The longevity field is underfunded, slowing progress, especially for large-scale human trials of promising drugs like rapamycin.
*   **Lifestyle Interventions:** Overemphasis on lifestyle interventions that may improve healthspan but not necessarily lifespan.
*   **Combination Therapies:** The potential of combination therapies is highly underrated.
*   **DNA Repair Mechanisms:** Underexplored avenues for interventions.
