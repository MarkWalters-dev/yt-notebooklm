# 2022-04-17 AGE Products Impact Lifespan - Impact Of Hyperglycemia Kidney Function And The Microbiome

## Executive Summary
*   Dietary Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) shorten lifespan in mice, even when calorie restriction is applied.
*   Reducing dietary AGEs extends lifespan in mice.
*   While dietary AGE intake is not directly linked to mortality in one human study, higher *blood* levels of AGEs (specifically CML) are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk in older adults.
*   Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and poor kidney function independently increase blood CML levels.
*   The gut microbiome plays a role in CML absorption; impaired gut barrier function, which is exacerbated by aging and the presence of a microbiome, leads to higher blood CML.

## Mouse Data: Dietary AGEs and Lifespan

### Calorie Restriction (CR) and Lifespan
*   Calorie restriction (40%) in mice significantly extends lifespan.
*   CR diets naturally reduce both calorie and AGE intake (e.g., CML reduced by 37%).

### Impact of Added Dietary AGEs on CR Mice
*   When AGEs (specifically CML) were added to the diet of CR mice, even with similar food and calorie intake as regular CR mice, the lifespan extension observed with CR was abolished.
*   This indicates that dietary AGEs, rather than just calories, negatively impact lifespan in the context of CR.

### Impact of Reduced Dietary AGEs
*   Mice fed a diet low in AGEs exhibited a significant extension of lifespan compared to those on a regular AGE-containing diet.
*   This suggests that reducing dietary AGEs can increase lifespan.

## Human Evidence: Dietary AGEs and Mortality

*   One study involving 29,000 people found no association between dietary intake of CML and an increased risk of mortality.
*   Further research is needed to definitively conclude the impact of dietary AGEs on human mortality.

## Human Evidence: Blood AGEs (CML) and Mortality

### CML Levels Increase with Age
*   Blood levels of CML significantly increase in humans between the ages of 35 and 85.

### Blood CML Levels and All-Cause Mortality Risk
*   **Older Adult Women (65-90+ years):** Women in the lowest quartile of blood CML levels (<0.68 µg/mL) showed improved survival compared to those with higher levels (>0.68 µg/mL) over approximately five years.
*   **Both Genders (65-90+ years):** In a longer follow-up study (up to seven years), individuals in the lowest two tertiles of blood CML (<0.4 µg/mL) had improved survival compared to those in the highest tertile (>0.4 µg/mL), indicating an increased all-cause mortality risk with higher circulating CML.

## Factors Influencing Blood CML Levels

### Hyperglycemia (High Blood Sugar)
*   **Mechanism:** CML levels increase in the presence of high blood sugar.
*   **Study 1 (Humans):** A 2-hour hyperglycemic clamp (raising blood glucose from ~90 mg/dL to 180 mg/dL) resulted in a significant increase in blood CML.
*   **Study 2 (Humans):** A 24-hour glucose infusion (raising blood glucose from ~95 mg/dL to 192 mg/dL) led to a significant increase in blood CML levels from baseline (74 nmol/L) after 24 hours, but not after 2 hours.
*   **Note:** These studies used significantly higher glucose levels than typical age-related increases. The impact of age-related blood glucose increases on blood CML requires further investigation.

### Kidney Function
*   **Mechanism:** Poor kidney function can contribute to increased blood CML levels. Kidney function declines with aging.
*   **Association:** A negative or inverse association exists between blood CML levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), an index of kidney function.
    *   Higher blood CML levels are associated with worse kidney function (lower eGFR).
    *   Lower blood CML levels are associated with better kidney function (higher eGFR).
*   **Studies:** This inverse association was observed in studies of adults with an average age of 48 and in older adults with a median age of 64.

### Gut Microbiome and Gut Barrier Function
*   **Mechanism:** The gut microbiome influences CML absorption and systemic levels.
*   **Mouse Data (Force-fed CML):**
    *   **Young Mice (1-2 months):** CML absorption into the blood was similar in mice with and without a microbiome.
    *   **Aged Mice (22-24 months):** Aged mice *with* a microbiome showed increased blood CML levels. Aged mice *without* a microbiome did not show this increase.
    *   **Fecal CML Content (Aged Mice):** Germ-free (microbiome-absent) aged mice had four-fold higher CML content in their fecal pellets compared to aged mice with a microbiome, indicating less absorption into circulation.
*   **Gut Barrier Function:**
    *   Aged mice *with* a microbiome exhibit worse gut barrier function (increased intestinal permeability) compared to germ-free mice.
    *   Young mice show similar intestinal permeability regardless of microbiome status.
    *   Intestinal permeability increases with age in mice with a microbiome but not in germ-free mice.
*   **Intervention (Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase - IAP):**
    *   Supplementation with IAP in aged mice significantly improved intestinal permeability.
    *   Following IAP supplementation, blood CML levels were significantly reduced in aged mice that were force-fed CML.
    *   This suggests that interventions improving gut barrier function can reduce CML absorption.

## Summary of Key Factors Increasing Blood CML:
*   Hyperglycemia
*   Poor Kidney Function
*   High Intestinal Permeability / Poor Gut Barrier Function (exacerbated by aging and microbiome)
