# 2025-05-01 Dave Pascoe Presents His Blood Test Results - Inflammation

## Executive Summary

*   Dave Pascoe's HSCRP levels have shown a positive trend, decreasing over time, with recent values reported at 0.36, 0.2, and 0.24.
*   TNF alpha levels appear to have increased, prompting concern, though this is based on only two data points.
*   Tumors secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF alpha, IL-6, and HSCRP, emphasizing the importance of monitoring all these markers, even if HSCRP is low.
*   The optimal range for TNF alpha is considered "as low as possible," ideally below the limit of detection (0.4 picograms per mL).
*   Pascoe plans to increase the frequency of testing for inflammatory markers if they are detected above the limit, aiming to keep them as low as possible.

## HSCRP Levels

Dave Pascoe's High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (HSCRP) levels have shown a positive trend, gradually reducing over time. While an initial elevated data point was noted, subsequent measurements indicate improvement.

His latest HSCRP results include:
*   **2021:** 0.33
*   **Most Recent:** 0.36, with other recent values as low as 0.2 and 0.24.

These values are considered low and within a desirable range, indicating a reduction in general inflammation.

## TNF alpha and Cancer Link

Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF alpha) is a significant pro-inflammatory cytokine. Data suggests that TNF alpha levels have increased in Pascoe's recent tests, though this is based on only two data points, with the last measurement being from 2022.

The link between inflammation and cancer is critical:
*   Cancer incidence increases with aging.
*   Tumors secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF alpha, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and HSCRP.
*   It is crucial to monitor all these markers, as elevated levels of TNF alpha or IL-6 could exist even if HSCRP remains low.

The optimal range for TNF alpha is "as low as possible," ideally below the limit of detection, which is noted as 0.4 picograms per mL. Pascoe's recent TNF alpha levels are higher than this optimal range, warranting closer monitoring.

## Inflammatory Cytokines & Tracking Strategy

Other inflammatory markers like IL-6 are also relevant to monitor in conjunction with HSCRP and TNF alpha.

Pascoe's strategy for tracking inflammatory markers:
*   If a marker is below the limit of detection, it may not be measured in every test (e.g., eight times a year).
*   If a marker is detected above the limit of detection, it will be tracked more frequently to monitor trends and facilitate interventions aimed at keeping levels as low as possible.

Factors such as exercise standardization could potentially influence TNF alpha levels, adding complexity to interpretation based on limited data points. A retest for TNF alpha and IL-6 is deemed necessary due to the age of the last data point for these markers.
