# 2025-01-15 Stem Cells Improve Digestive Health 82 Year Old Longevity Biohacker Kenneth Scott s Experience

## Executive Summary

*   Research on Yamanaka factors enabled the reversal of human cells to an embryonic state (induced pluripotent stem cells) and suggests the possibility of reversing body age.
*   VSELs (Very Small Embryonic-Like Stem Cells) are dormant stem cells found in adult blood, which can be reactivated using specific laser light.
*   The VSEL therapy protocol involves extracting autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP), activating it with laser light, and then re-injecting it systemically or targeting specific areas with a SONG laser.
*   Personal accounts indicate significant improvements in digestive health (due to vagus nerve treatment), cognitive function, and repair of chronic joint injuries.
*   The treatment is considered very safe as it uses the individual's own blood activated only by light.

## Introduction to Stem Cell Therapy

The field of stem cell therapy began with Yamanaka's work in 2006, demonstrating the ability to reverse adult human cells into a primitive, embryonic-like state using what are now known as Yamanaka factors. This breakthrough not only led to the development of various stem cell treatments but also ignited the belief that it might be possible to reverse the age of the entire body.

Most existing stem cell treatments use relatively large stem cells that cannot penetrate smaller capillaries, limiting systemic administration. A different approach involves Very Small Embryonic-Like Stem Cells (VSELs).

## VSEL (Very Small Embryic-Like Stem Cells) Technology

Research conducted in Cambridge, England, identified VSELs as very small embryonic-like stem cells present in our blood cells. These cells become dormant during fetal development and remain in the body but are inactive. The Cambridge research successfully determined a method to reactivate these dormant VSELs.

## VSEL Therapy Protocol

The current VSEL therapy protocol is as follows:

*   **Step 1:** A sample of 60-70 cc of blood is drawn from the patient.
*   **Step 2:** The blood sample is spun down using a centrifuge to extract the platelet-rich plasma (PRP).
*   **Step 3:** The extracted PRP, which contains the embryonic stem cells, is activated using laser light of a specific frequency.
*   **Step 4:** The activated PRP is then re-injected into the body, typically via an IV push into the arm.

This process is considered very safe as it uses the patient's own blood, which is only treated with light before re-injection.

### VSEL Therapy Process Flowchart

Blood Sample (60-70cc)
-> Centrifuge
-> Extract Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP)
-> Activate PRP with Specific Laser Light
-> Re-inject into Body

## Systemic Application and Targeted Treatment

VSEL treatment is systemic, administered via an IV push. However, the migration of these stem cells can be partially targeted by radiating specific body parts with a SONG laser, which penetrates body tissues. This allows for attracting VSELs to areas like the brain, vagus nerve, or a knee, enhancing their activity in those targeted regions.

## Personal Experiences and Outcomes

Both Kenneth Scott and his wife have experienced significant successes with VSEL therapy:

*   **Digestive Health:** Kenneth Scott, who had struggled with digestive issues for decades (possibly due to antibiotic use), received VSEL treatment targeting his vagus nerve (which connects the brain and gut). His digestive system "changed overnight," demonstrating much better function. A minor side effect observed was a slight weight gain, possibly indicating improved nutrient extraction from food.
*   **Cognitive Function:** Kenneth Scott's wife, who had been experiencing cognitive challenges, had her brain treated with VSELs. Within 24 hours of the treatment, her demeanor significantly improved. She expressed interest in attending an AI conference and showed renewed engagement in personal care, demonstrating a dramatic shift in her cognitive and emotional state.
*   **Joint Repair:** Kenneth Scott had a 40-year-old injury to his right knee from running. Following a VSEL injection, his knee reportedly repaired within about a week, and he has not experienced any trouble with it since.
