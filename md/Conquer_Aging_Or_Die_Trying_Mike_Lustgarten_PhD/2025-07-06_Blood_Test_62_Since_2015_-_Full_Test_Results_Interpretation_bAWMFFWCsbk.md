# 2025-07-06 Blood Test 62 Since 2015 - Full Test Results Interpretation

## Executive Summary

*   **Biological Age:** The recent blood test indicates a biological age of 35 years, significantly younger than the chronological age (17 years younger), as determined by the PhenoAge calculator.
*   **Cardiovascular Health Markers:** HDL cholesterol has remained consistently optimal (>50 mg/dL) for 17 consecutive tests. ApoB levels are within the optimal range (<70 mg/dL), but the ApoB to ApoA1 ratio is close to the upper limit of optimal (<0.47). Triglycerides are elevated above the optimal target (<45 mg/dL).
*   **Metabolic Health:** HbA1c shows a slight increase to 5.4% compared to a previous 5.1%, indicating a need for improvement to maintain youth-associated levels. Glucose is within the optimal range (80-94 mg/dL).
*   **Kidney Function & Inflammation:** Cystatin C, a marker used in the GrimAge epigenetic clock, has increased to 0.84 (optimal <0.7), suggesting a need for intervention. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) remains below the lab's detection limit (<0.2 mg/L) for 25 consecutive tests, indicating low inflammation.
*   **Hormonal and Other Markers:** DHEA Sulfate has declined to 110, indicating a potential area of concern. Thyroid hormones (Free T4 and Free T3) have improved due to medication adjustments.

## Lipid Panel & Cardiovascular Health

*   **HDL Cholesterol:**
    *   Current Result: 65 mg/dL (borderline optimal for the tested range)
    *   Historical Data: 17 consecutive tests with HDL ≥ 50 mg/dL. Previous 45 tests (dating back to 2015) averaged 45 mg/dL.
    *   Optimal Range: 50-60 mg/dL (for men, based on large meta-analysis).
*   **Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1):**
    *   Current Result: 137 mg/dL
    *   Reference Range: 115 mg/dL (based on 2004 data)
    *   Optimal Range: 150-180 mg/dL (based on more recent data)
    *   Note: Considered a potentially better marker of heart disease mortality risk than HDL.
*   **Triglycerides:**
    *   Current Result: 65 mg/dL
    *   Reference Range: <150 mg/dL
    *   Optimal Range: <45 mg/dL (for lowest heart disease mortality risk)
*   **LDL Cholesterol:**
    *   Current Result: At the borderline of optimal.
    *   Optimal Range: Not below 65 mg/dL (to avoid a small but significant increase in risk based on a large study).
*   **Very Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL):**
    *   Estimation: Triglycerides / 5 = ~13 mg/dL
*   **Non-HDL Cholesterol:**
    *   Current Result: 79 mg/dL
    *   Calculation: LDL + (Triglycerides / 5) = 78 mg/dL (slight discrepancy in reporting).
    *   Note: In this case, almost all non-HDL cholesterol is derived from VLDL and LDL.
*   **Apolipoprotein B (ApoB):**
    *   Current Result: 67 mg/dL
    *   Reference Range: <100 mg/dL (based on 2019-2020 data)
    *   Optimal Range: <70 mg/dL (for lowest cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk, based on large epidemiological studies).
    *   Note: Considered a potentially better marker of heart disease mortality risk than non-HDL cholesterol.
*   **ApoB to ApoA1 Ratio:**
    *   Current Result: 0.49
    *   Reference Range: <0.77
    *   Optimal Range: <0.47 (for lowest cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk)

## Metabolic Health

*   **Glucose:**
    *   Current Result: 90 mg/dL
    *   Optimal Range: 80-94 mg/dL (for all-cause mortality risk).
    *   Historical Data: Average glucose since 2015 is approximately 90 mg/dL.
*   **Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c):**
    *   Current Result: 5.4%
    *   Optimal Range: 5.0-6.0% (meta-analysis for all-cause mortality risk)
    *   Youth-Associated Range: ~5.3-5.4% (for individuals <30 years old)
    *   Historical Data: October 2023 was 5.1%. Average for all four tests in 2025 is 5.38%.
    *   Note: An increase from previous levels suggests a need to lower HbA1c back towards 5.1%.

## Liver Health and Function

*   **Albumin:**
    *   Current Result: Coded as green (good).
    *   Note: Declines with age and is associated with increased all-cause mortality risk when low.
*   **Alkaline Phosphatase:**
    *   Current Result: 41 U/L
    *   Optimal Range: Less than 48 U/L (values >48 U/L associated with increased all-cause mortality risk).
*   **Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST):**
    *   Current Result: 26 U/L
    *   Optimal Range: High teens to low twenties (associated with lowest all-cause mortality risk).
    *   Note: Values of 27 U/L are associated with significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality.
*   **Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT):**
    *   Current Result: 29 U/L
    *   Optimal Range: High teens to low twenties (associated with lowest all-cause mortality risk).
    *   Note: Values of 29 U/L are associated with significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality.

## Immune System Markers

*   **Total Immunoglobulin G (IgG):**
    *   Current Result: 1000 mg/dL
    *   Note: Genetic reduction of IgG has extended lifespan in Little (dwarf) mice. Lower IgG levels are seen in interventions that extend lifespan. Further biomarker analysis is planned.
*   **Candida IgG:**
    *   Current Result: Higher than the reference range.
    *   Historical Data: Elevated for 11 consecutive tests since 2017.
    *   Intervention: Fluconazole (antifungal) was administered at 200 mg/day for 12 days after a previous test, but did not reduce levels below the reference range. A higher dose (400 mg/day for ~7 days) is planned for a future test.
    *   Note: High levels suggest the immune system is working harder to keep systemic Candida levels in check.

## Thyroid Hormones

*   **Free T4 (FT4):**
    *   Current Result: Close to optimal.
    *   Optimal Range: Less than 0.8 ng/dL (based on all-cause mortality risk).
*   **Free T3 (FT3):**
    *   Current Result: Close to optimal.
    *   Optimal Range: Greater than 3.2 pg/mL (associated with lowest risk of death for all causes).
*   **FT4 to FT3 Ratio:**
    *   Current Result: 0.36
    *   Historical Data: Previously 0.2 or less.
    *   Note: The conversion of FT4 to FT3 declines during aging. The current ratio is considered good news.

## Kidney Function & Protein Biomarkers

*   **Cystatin C:**
    *   Current Result: 0.84 ng/mL
    *   Optimal Range: <0.7 ng/mL
    *   Historical Data: 0.72 in January 2024. Average for the first four tests in 2025 is 0.81.
    *   Note: A protein biomarker used in the GrimAge epigenetic clock. An increase suggests a need for intervention.
*   **Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) - Cystatin C Based:**
    *   Current Result: 101 mL/min/1.73m²
    *   Note: Cystatin C may be a more reliable marker of kidney function than creatinine, as it is less affected by muscle mass.
*   **Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) - Creatinine Based:**
    *   Current Result: 105 mL/min/1.73m²
    *   Optimal Range: eGFR of 100 is average for 30-year-olds.
*   **Beta-2 Microglobulin (B2M):**
    *   Current Result: 1.55 ng/mL
    *   Optimal Range: Lower is better, closer to 1 ng/mL.
    *   Note: Another protein biomarker used in the GrimAge epigenetic clock. Limited data available for optimization.

## Blood Cell Counts

*   **Total White Blood Cells (WBC):**
    *   Current Result: 3.6 x 10⁹/L (flagged as low by the lab)
    *   Note: The individual components (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes) provide more insight than the total count.
*   **Neutrophils:**
    *   Current Result: 1642 cells/µL
    *   Optimal Range: 2000-3000 cells/µL (associated with lowest all-cause mortality risk).
    *   Note: Values <2000 cells/µL are associated with increased risk. This is coded as red, though it may be beneficial in the context of low inflammation markers.
*   **Lymphocytes:**
    *   Current Result: 1566 cells/µL
    *   Optimal Range: 1900-2100 cells/µL (associated with lowest all-cause mortality risk).
    *   Note: Values <1900 cells/µL are associated with a spike in all-cause mortality risk. Current levels are an improvement over the past three tests.
*   **Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW):**
    *   Current Result: 12.2%
    *   Optimal Range: 11.4-12.6% (for lowest all-cause mortality risk).
    *   Historical Trend: For the past five tests, RDW has been increasing (from 11.7% to 12.2%), moving in the wrong direction despite being within the optimal range.
*   **Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV):**
    *   Current Result: 92.3 fL
    *   Historical Data: Average for 2025 is 92.0 fL, better than 2024 average (92.7 fL), but worse than the 57-test average since 2015 (90.7 fL).
    *   Optimal Trend: Moving towards 90.7 fL or lower is associated with lowest risk of death.
*   **Hemoglobin:**
    *   Current Result: 14.6 g/dL
    *   Optimal Range (Men): 14.0-15.9 g/dL
    *   Historical Data: Average since 2015 is 15.0 g/dL.
    *   Note: Trend shows a slight decline over time, indicating a need to increase levels back towards 15.0 g/dL.

## Inflammation Marker

*   **High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP):**
    *   Current Result: <0.2 mg/L (lab detection limit)
    *   Historical Data: 25 consecutive tests with hs-CRP ≤0.3 mg/L. For the past 9 tests, it has been <0.2 mg/L.
    *   Note: Consistently good news, indicating low inflammation.

## Metabolic Byproducts

*   **Homocysteine:**
    *   Current Result: 10.7 µmol/L
    *   Historical Data: Values were half this amount (~20 years ago).
    *   Intervention: Supplementation with zinc and dietary betaine (beets, amaranth) has been initiated to test the hypothesis that suboptimal zinc absorption or availability affects betaine methanrexyrase activity.
    *   Note: Homocysteine accelerates cell senescence. The goal is to reduce levels closer to 5 µmol/L.

## Hormonal & Steroid Biomarkers

*   **Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate (DHEA-S):**
    *   Current Result: 110 ng/dL
    *   Historical Data: Second lowest value out of 22 tests since 2022. Below the 22-test average.
    *   Note: Declines with age, with average values of ~300 ng/dL found in 20-year-olds. Analysis of LDL correlation is underway to potentially improve DHEA-S without raising LDL.

## Other Biomarkers

*   **Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (AAG1):**
    *   Note: Not explicitly mentioned in the transcript, but often correlated with metabolic health and inflammation.
*   **Beta-2 Microglobulin (B2M):**
    *   Note: Mentioned as one of the seven protein biomarkers used in the GrimAge epigenetic clock. Current result is 1.55 ng/mL, with lower values preferred.
*   **Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW):**
    *   Note: Mentioned as a major predictor of biological age in the PhenoAge clock. Current result is 12.2%, within the optimal range but trending upwards.
*   **Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV):**
    *   Note: Average red blood cell volume. Current result is 92.3 fL, trending away from the historical average of 90.7 fL.
*   **Hemoglobin:**
    *   Note: Current result is 14.6 g/dL, trending below the historical average of 15.0 g/dL.
