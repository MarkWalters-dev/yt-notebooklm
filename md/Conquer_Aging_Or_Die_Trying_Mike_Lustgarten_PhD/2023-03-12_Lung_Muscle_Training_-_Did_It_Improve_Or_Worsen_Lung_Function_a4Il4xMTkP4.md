# 2023-03-12 Lung Muscle Training - Did It Improve Or Worsen Lung Function

## Executive Summary
*   Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), a measure of lung function, peaks around age 20 and then undergoes a significant decline with aging.
*   FEV1 is a strong predictor of chronological age, ranking as the third most significant predictor in men and second in women in a 2022 preprint study.
*   A personal 7-week lung training protocol (Breather Fit, 6 days/week, 5-8 minutes/day, highest resistance) resulted in a significant *worsening* of FEV1 from an average of 3.25 liters to 2.98 liters.
*   Upon cessation of training for a subsequent 7-week period, FEV1 significantly *improved* to an average of 3.09 liters, suggesting that the training protocol may have caused overtraining.
*   Inspiratory muscle training has been independently shown to significantly reduce systolic blood pressure across various adult age groups and in individuals with obstructive sleep apnea.

## FEV1 and Aging
Lung function, defined by the Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), declines during aging. FEV1 measures how much air can be forcefully expired in one second.

Data for healthy non-smokers indicates that FEV1 peaks around 20 years old, followed by a precipitous decline during aging. This decline is significant because FEV1 is a top predictor of chronological age. In a 2022 preprint study, FEV1 ranked as the third most significant biomarker for predicting chronological age in men and the second most significant in women. Systolic blood pressure was identified as the top predictor in this study.

## Personal Lung Training Experiment
Considering the age-related decline in lung function and FEV1's role as a predictor of chronological age, a personal experiment was initiated in September 2022 to test if the age-related decline in FEV1 could be slowed or prevented through lung training. The Breather Fit lung training device was used for this study.

### Methodology
The primary study ran for seven weeks, from October 17 through December 8.

**Training Protocol:**
*   **Device:** Breather Fit
*   **Duration:** 7 weeks
*   **Frequency:** 6 days per week
*   **Daily Time:** Started with 5 minutes per day of continuous breathing, increasing to 8 minutes per day by week seven.
*   **Resistance:** Highest resistance settings were used for both inspiration and expiration.

**Testing Protocol:**
*   **Frequency:** FEV1 was tested three times per week.
*   **Daily Attempts:** On each testing day, FEV1 was measured nine times, and the best attempt was recorded.
*   **Spirometer:** An at-home spirometer was used, which has demonstrated a 0.96 linearity correlation when compared with physician's office spirometry.

## FEV1 Results
The experiment tracked FEV1 from September 2022 through February 2023.

*   **Before Training (Sept 20 - Oct 16, 2022):** Over 12 days, the average FEV1 was 3.25 liters.
*   **During Training (Oct 17 - Dec 8, 2022):** During the 7-week training period (21 tests), the average FEV1 was 2.98 liters. A two-sample t-test indicated a significant worsening of FEV1 during training.
*   **Post-Training (Dec 9, 2022 - Feb 2, 2023):** Following cessation of training for a subsequent 7-week period (21 tests), the average FEV1 increased significantly to 3.09 liters (two-sample t-test).

These data suggest potential overtraining during the active lung training period, leading to a worsened FEV1. Published studies on lung training devices typically use protocols of six days per week and at least five minutes per day, which in this case, appeared to be an excessive stimulus for FEV1 improvement.

## Blood Pressure and Lung Training
Inspiratory muscle training has been shown to reduce blood pressure. Studies on lung training devices have reported significant improvements in systolic blood pressure across various age groups, including young adults, middle-aged adults, older adults, and middle-aged/older adults with obstructive sleep apnea. This effect was observed regardless of baseline systolic blood pressure, showing improvements in individuals with relatively higher blood pressure (around 135 mmHg in middle-aged and older adults) and relatively lower blood pressure (around 110 mmHg in younger adults).
