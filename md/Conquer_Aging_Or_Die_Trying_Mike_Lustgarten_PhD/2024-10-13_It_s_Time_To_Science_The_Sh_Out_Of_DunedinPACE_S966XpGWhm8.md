# 2024-10-13 It s Time To Science The Sh Out Of DunedinPACE

## Executive Summary

*   Calorie restriction (12% for two years) significantly slowed epigenetic aging as measured by DunedinPACE, a finding not detected by other epigenetic clocks.
*   DunedinPACE is an epigenetic approximation of 19 biomarkers, including VO2 max, lung function (FEV1/FVC, FEV1), blood pressure, metabolic health (HbA1c), body composition (BMI, waist-hip ratio), and lipoprotein profiles (Triglycerides, Total Cholesterol, HDL, ApoB/ApoA1 ratio, Lipoprotein(a)).
*   DunedinPACE values show an age-related increase, with younger individuals typically exhibiting lower values.
*   A significant inverse correlation was found between cocoa bean intake and Lipoprotein(a) levels, suggesting a potential dietary intervention to lower this biomarker.
*   While not statistically significant in the current dataset, a positive correlation trend was observed between higher fiber intake and faster DunedinPACE, prompting an experimental reduction in fiber intake.

## DunedinPACE: A Sensitive Epigenetic Clock

DunedinPACE appears to be a sensitive epigenetic clock for predicting the speed of epigenetic aging.

### Calorie Restriction Study

*   A two-year study demonstrated that individuals with 12% calorie restriction exhibited a significantly slower epigenetic pace of aging compared to those eating ad libitum.
*   This finding is notable as other gold-standard epigenetic clocks (Horvath, PhenoAge, GrimAge) did not detect this slower pace, suggesting DunedinPACE's superior sensitivity.

## Personal DunedinPACE Data and Trends

### Recent Test Results

*   As of September 6th, the most recent DunedinPACE test (test #6 in 2024) recorded a value of 0.88.
*   The typical range for DunedinPACE is 0.6 (slowest aging rate) to 1.4 (fastest aging rate). A value of 0.88 indicates room for improvement towards the slower end.

### Longitudinal Data (17 Tests since 2022)

*   **2022 (3 tests):** Average DunedinPACE of 0.84.
*   **2023 (8 tests):** Average DunedinPACE of 0.80. This indicates a directional improvement.
*   **2024 (6 tests):** Average DunedinPACE of 0.84, including the most recent 0.88, indicating a return to 2022 levels.
*   **Overall (17 tests):** The average DunedinPACE is 0.82, showing relative stability. However, two of the last three tests (0.91 and 0.88) were above average.

### DunedinPACE and Chronological Age

*   DunedinPACE generally increases with chronological age.
*   Younger individuals (e.g., in their twenties) are more likely to have lower DunedinPACE values compared to older individuals.
*   This age-related trend likely contributes to younger individuals dominating rejuvenation leaderboard rankings.
*   The individual's most recent data point is close to the average for their chronological age, which is considered an "age-expected" value. The goal is to achieve values closer to 0.6, regardless of chronological age.

## Strategies for Improving DunedinPACE

### Dietary Correlations

The correlation analysis of diet with DunedinPACE over 17 tests did not yield any statistically significant results (p < 0.05).

*   **Fiber:** While not significant, fiber showed a trend. A positive correlation was observed, suggesting that lower fiber intake was associated with lower DunedinPACE, and higher fiber intake with higher DunedinPACE.
    *   Fiber intake range: 79-91 grams per day.
    *   Current intake (since September 6th test): 80 grams per day, aiming for the lower end of the observed range.
    *   **Caveat:** This strategy is based on a non-significant correlation.

### Biomarkers Comprising DunedinPACE

DunedinPACE is an epigenetic approximation of 19 biomarkers:

*   **Metabolic Health:** HbA1c
*   **Cardiovascular Fitness:** VO2 max
*   **Lung Function:** FEV1/FVC, FEV1
*   **Blood Pressure:** Mean Arterial Pressure
*   **Body Composition:** BMI, Waist-to-Hip Ratio
*   **Oral Health:** Gum health indicators
*   **Kidney Function:** Two markers
*   **White Blood Cell Count**
*   **Telomere Length** (White blood cell)
*   **Lipoprotein and Lipid Profiles:**
    *   Triglycerides
    *   Total Cholesterol
    *   HDL
    *   ApoB to ApoA1 ratio
    *   Lipoprotein(a)

### Investigating Lipoprotein(a)

*   Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) has consistently been relatively high in the individual's data (range 80-100 nanomolar, reference < 75).
*   **Correlation with DunedinPACE:** Over eight tests, a positive correlation (r = 0.6) was observed between Lp(a) and DunedinPACE, though it was not statistically significant (p = 0.11). More data is needed to confirm this relationship.
*   **Potential for Reduction:** The observed range in Lp(a) suggests it may be modifiable, despite being considered genetically influenced.

#### Cacao Bean Intake and Lipoprotein(a)

*   **Significant Inverse Correlation:** Cacao bean intake showed a significant inverse correlation with Lp(a) (r = -0.42, p = 0.04) over 24 tests. Higher cacao intake was associated with lower Lp(a) levels.
*   **Intervention:** Increased daily cacao bean intake to an average of 19 grams per day for the past ten days.
*   **Expected Outcome:** Extrapolation suggests this intake level could correlate with an Lp(a) of approximately 80 nanomolar, potentially leading to a DunedinPACE value around 0.74.
*   **Retesting Schedule:** A new test is scheduled for October 18th, with results expected mid-to-late November or early December. The high cacao intake will be maintained for at least six weeks post-test.

#### Future Steps

*   Continue tracking Lp(a) alongside DunedinPACE.
*   Further investigate other foods or nutrients potentially correlated with Lp(a) or other biomarkers within DunedinPACE.
