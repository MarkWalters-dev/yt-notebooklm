# 2025-01-26 Coffee And Health - What Time Of Day May Be Best

## Executive Summary

*   Drinking coffee in the morning (4 AM - 11:59 AM) was significantly associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality compared to non-drinkers, for intakes greater than one cup per day.
*   The maximum associated risk reduction for morning coffee was 29% for individuals consuming two to three cups per day.
*   Coffee consumed throughout the entire day (up to three cups) was not significantly associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk in this study. Even for more than three cups per day, the association did not reach statistical significance for all-day drinkers.
*   The study attempted to account for healthy user bias by adjusting for variables such as physical activity, calorie intake, and diet quality (Alternative Healthy Eating Index - AHEI).
*   Limitations include the AHEI's incomplete coverage of ultra-processed foods and a limited set of comorbidities (only diabetes and hypertension) included in the model.

## Study Findings: Coffee Timing and All-Cause Mortality

This study investigated the association between coffee intake timing and the hazard ratio (HR) or risk of death for all causes.

### Morning Coffee Intake (4 AM - 11:59 AM)

For individuals who consumed coffee between 4 AM and 11:59 AM (before noon), when compared with non-drinkers:

*   **Up to one cup per day:** Was not significantly associated with a reduced risk of death for all causes. The 95% confidence interval for this intake level overlapped with 1.0.
*   **One to two cups per day:** Was significantly associated with a 16% lower risk of death for all causes.
*   **Two to three cups per day:** Was significantly associated with a 29% lower risk of death for all causes. This represented the maximum associated risk reduction.
*   **Greater than three cups per day:** Was significantly associated with a 21% lower risk of death for all causes.

**Summary for Morning Coffee:** Consuming more than one cup of coffee per day in the morning was significantly associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk.

### All-Day Coffee Intake (Anytime)

For individuals who reported drinking coffee anytime during the day, not just in the morning, when compared with non-drinkers:

*   **Up to one cup per day:** Was not significantly associated with a reduced risk of death for all causes.
*   **One to two cups per day:** Was not significantly associated with a reduced risk of death for all causes.
*   **Two to three cups per day:** Was not significantly associated with a reduced risk of death for all causes.
*   **Greater than three cups per day:** Was not significantly associated with a reduced risk of death for all causes, although it was close to reaching statistical significance.

**Summary for All-Day Coffee:** Coffee intake consumed throughout the day was not significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk in this study.

## Addressing Healthy User Bias and Study Methodology

To account for potential healthy user bias and other confounding factors, the study included model adjustments for various variables:

### Standard Adjustment Variables

*   Age
*   Sex
*   BMI
*   Race/Ethnicity
*   Family Income
*   Education

### Key Variables Included to Account for Healthy User Bias

*   **Regular Physical Activity:**
    *   Defined as greater than or equal to 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity activity OR greater than 75 minutes per week of vigorous intensity activity.
*   **Calorie Intake**
*   **Diet Quality:**
    *   Assessed using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI).
    *   **Note:** While valuable, the AHEI accounts for sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice but does not fully encompass the majority of ultra-processed foods. However, a low AHEI score would generally indicate a diet high in unhealthy foods.

### Comorbidities (Partial Inclusion)

*   **Included:** Only diabetes and hypertension were included in the model.
*   **Limitation:** Many other health conditions that could potentially impact the association between coffee intake timing and all-cause mortality risk (e.g., liver disease, kidney disease, lung disorders) were not included in the model. In epidemiological studies, a more comprehensive inclusion of comorbidities is often desirable to fully account for healthy user bias.
