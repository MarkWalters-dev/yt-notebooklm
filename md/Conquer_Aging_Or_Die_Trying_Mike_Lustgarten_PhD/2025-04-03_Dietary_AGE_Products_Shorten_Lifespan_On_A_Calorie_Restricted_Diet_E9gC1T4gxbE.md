# 2025-04-03 Dietary AGE Products Shorten Lifespan On A Calorie Restricted Diet

## Executive Summary
*   Calorie restriction (CR) in mice significantly extends lifespan, partly due to a reduction in dietary Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs).
*   Supplementing a CR diet with AGEs negates the lifespan-extending benefits of calorie restriction.
*   Reducing dietary AGEs, even without calorie restriction, leads to a significant extension of lifespan.
*   N-epsilon-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) is a specific AGE that, when reduced in the diet, increases lifespan.

## Mouse Data

### Calorie Restriction and Lifespan
*   **Calorie Restricted (CR) Diet:** 40% restriction of food intake, resulting in a 40% reduction in calorie intake.
*   **Lifespan Impact:** CR mice exhibited significant extension of lifespan compared to mice on a regular diet.
*   **AGEs Reduction on CR Diet:** Dietary AGE product CML was 37% less in CR mice compared to regular diet mice due to lower food consumption.

### Impact of Dietary AGEs on CR Diet
*   **Experimental Setup:** Mice were fed a diet with similar food and calorie intake to CR mice, but with significantly higher levels of AGEs.
*   **AGE Levels:** AGE products in the "CR high diet" were nearly threefold higher than in the standard CR diet and also higher than in the regular diet.
*   **Lifespan Impact:** The lifespan extension observed in standard CR mice was abolished when AGEs were added to their diet. This suggests that feeding AGEs to mice on a CR diet shortens lifespan.

### Reducing Dietary AGEs and Lifespan
*   **Experimental Setup:** Mice were fed either a regular diet containing AGEs or a low-AGE diet.
*   **Lifespan Impact:** Mice fed the low-AGE product diet showed a significant extension of lifespan. This indicates that reducing dietary AGEs can increase lifespan, independent of calorie restriction.

## Key AGE Product: N-epsilon-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML)
*   **Description:** CML is a specific dietary AGE product.
*   **Dietary Levels:** Reduced by 37% in mice on a 40% CR diet compared to a regular diet.
*   **Contribution:** The reduction in dietary CML is implicated as a factor contributing to the lifespan extension seen in calorie-restricted mice.
