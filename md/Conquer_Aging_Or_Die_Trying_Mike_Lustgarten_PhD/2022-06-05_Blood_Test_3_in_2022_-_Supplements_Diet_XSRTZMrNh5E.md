# 2022-06-05 Blood Test 3 in 2022 - Supplements Diet

## Executive Summary
*   Biological age calculated 14-17 years younger than chronological age using Dr. Morgan Levine's calculator and aging.ai.
*   Dietary intake for the 56 days preceding the blood test was meticulously tracked using Cronometer and correlated with 24 'big picture' blood biomarkers to optimize intake beyond standard recommendations.
*   The strategy uses a 'net correlative score' to determine if an intake should be below, at, or above the individual's average intake since 2015 for optimal biomarker trends.
*   Current dietary intake follows 9 out of 10 macro-nutrient recommendations based on this correlation analysis, with fiber being an area for improvement. Micronutrient adherence is mixed.
*   Supplements taken during this period were Levothyroxine (for hypothyroidism), Vitamin D (1000 IU/day), and occasional low-dose melatonin (53 mcg/day).

## Supplements
During the 56-day period corresponding to Blood Test 3, the following supplements were used:
*   **Levothyroxine:** Taken daily for over 20 years due to hypothyroidism.
*   **Vitamin D:** 1000 IU per day.
*   **Melatonin:** Approximately 53 micrograms per day, occasionally at night.

No other geroprotectors were taken.

## Diet Tracking Methodology
Since 2015, all food intake has been weighed with a food scale and entered into Cronometer, a food tracking application. This detailed tracking allows for a unique analysis of diet's impact on biological markers.

**Data Collection Protocol:**
1.  Blood Test 2 was conducted on March 14, 2022.
2.  Blood Test 3 was conducted on May 9, 2022.
3.  The 56-day period between these two tests defines the dietary intake window for Blood Test 3.
4.  Average daily intake data (macro-nutrients, micro-nutrients, and individual food amounts) for this 56-day period is compiled.
5.  This dietary data is entered into a spreadsheet, alongside data from 37 prior blood tests since 2015.
6.  Correlations are calculated between dietary components and 24 'big picture' blood biomarkers (representing various organ systems, glucose, insulin sensitivity, etc.).
7.  The significance of these correlations is determined by p-values (< 0.05).
8.  A 'net correlative score' is calculated for each dietary component, indicating whether higher intake correlates with more biomarkers trending in a "wrong" (negative for aging/mortality risk) or "right" (positive for aging/mortality risk) direction.
9.  Based on the net correlative score, a personalized recommendation is generated:
    *   **Net negative score:** Eat below the individual's average intake since 2015.
    *   **Net neutral score:** Eat the individual's average intake since 2015.
    *   **Net positive score:** Eat above the individual's average intake since 2015.
10. Adherence to these personalized recommendations is tracked with a 'check' (following) or 'x' (not following). This approach aims for precision nutrition by optimizing diet to improve blood biomarkers.

## Calorie Intake
The average calorie intake for the 56-day period was 2323 calories per day.

*   **Net Correlative Score:** -6
    *   This negative score suggests that a calorie intake below the individual's average since 2015 may be optimal for blood biomarkers.
    *   Higher calorie intake significantly correlated with higher levels of six specific biomarkers, which are unfavorable for aging and all-cause mortality risk.

## Food Composition
For the 56-day period corresponding to Blood Test 3, 45 different foods were consumed daily on average. The diet is primarily whole-food based, with a structured approach to occasional "cheat meals."

**Cheat Meal Protocol:**
1.  **Timing:** Immediately after a blood test, and the day following.
2.  **Amount:** A relatively large amount (e.g., 1000 calories) of desired "junk food" (e.g., ice cream sandwiches, caramels).
3.  **Restriction:** No further junk food is consumed until the next blood test (in this case, for 54 days).
4.  **Rationale:** This self-developed approach works best for the individual, as opposed to more frequent cheat days.

Apart from chewing gum during workouts, the rest of the dietary intake consists of whole foods.
