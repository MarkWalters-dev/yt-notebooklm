# 2025-02-13 Calorie Restriction Reduces Immunoglobulin G Clip

## Executive Summary

*   Calorie Restriction (CR) is currently the most effective anti-aging intervention across various species.
*   A 20-year study in monkeys showed that CR improved aged appearance and increased lifespan.
*   In mice, CR specifically decreased Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels without affecting IgA or IgM.
*   Plasma IgG levels were reduced by over 50% due to CR, with an even greater reduction observed in depot tissue.
*   These findings suggest a significant link between immunoglobulin regulation and the aging process.

## Calorie Restriction as an Anti-Aging Intervention

Calorie restriction (CR) is recognized as the most efficient anti-aging intervention across different species. A notable 20-year experiment with monkeys demonstrated that those under calorie restriction throughout their lives exhibited a significantly improved aged appearance and an increased lifespan.

## Impact of Calorie Restriction on Immunoglobulin G

To investigate the effect of calorie restriction on Immunoglobulin G (IgG), mice were placed under a CR regimen. This intervention specifically decreased IgG levels without affecting IgA, IgM, or other antibody isotypes, indicating that IgG is specifically regulated by calorie restriction.

*   Plasma IgG levels decreased by over 50% in mice under calorie restriction.
*   The reduction in IgG was even more pronounced in depot tissue.

These observations strengthen the belief in a connection between immunoglobulin regulation and the aging process.
