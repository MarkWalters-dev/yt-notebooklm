## Biomarker Analysis

### Immune System and Infections

#### Candida IgG

*   **Finding:** Candida IgG is elevated at 1.1, exceeding the laboratory's reference range.
*   **Interpretation:** This indicates a past Candida infection. The absence of elevated Candida IgM suggests it is not a recent infection. The elevated IgG signifies that the immune system is working harder to manage systemic Candida.
*   **Physical Manifestation:** Associated with fungal infections on two toes.
*   **Interventions & Plans:**
    *   Increased olive intake based on observed correlations with lower IgG.
    *   If levels remain elevated for 10 consecutive tests, a two-week course of fluconazole will be prescribed, followed by a mid-June test specifically for Candida IgG.
*   **History:** Elevated Candida IgG has been observed as far back as 2017.

### Hormonal Markers

#### DHEA Sulfate

*   **Finding:** DHEA sulfate levels are stable at approximately 125 micrograms per deciliter over more than 20 tests in the past three years.
*   **Interpretation:** This indicates resistance to age-related decline, though it is below youthful levels of 300 micrograms per deciliter. Past supplementation 20 years ago may have influenced earlier high values.
*   **Goal:** To improve levels to 300 micrograms per deciliter without exogenous prescriptions.

#### Thyroid Hormones (FT3 and FT4)

*   **Finding:** Free T4 (FT4) decreased while Free T3 (FT3) increased, resulting in the highest FT3/FT4 ratio to date at 0.33.
*   **Interpretation:** This improvement signifies better conversion of the inactive thyroid hormone (FT4) to the active thyroid hormone (FT3), a process that declines with aging. The individual has a history of hypothyroidism diagnosed in their twenties.
*   **Interventions:** Adjusted thyroid medication by reducing Levothyroxine (T4) and increasing Liothyronine (T3).
*   **Optimal Ranges:** Target FT4 less than 0.8 and FT3 greater than 3.2.

### Blood Cell Counts and Markers

#### Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW)

*   **Finding:** RDW is 12.0, within the optimal range of 11.4 to 12.6.
*   **Interpretation:** This is a positive finding as RDW increases with aging. The goal is to maintain RDW within this optimal range and resist age-related increases.

#### Lymphocytes

*   **Finding:** Lymphocyte count is 1343, an improvement from the previous test's 1267, but still below the optimal range around 2000.
*   **Interpretation:** Values around 2000 are associated with younger individuals and lower all-cause mortality risk. Declining lymphocytes are linked to aging and increased mortality risk.
*   **Plan:** Implement changes in diet and supplements to further improve lymphocyte levels, detailed in future videos.

#### White Blood Cells (WBC)

*   **Finding:** Total white blood cells are 3.4, which is considered low.
*   **Interpretation:** This low count is significantly influenced by the lymphocyte levels. An optimal range for total WBC is estimated around 4.4.
*   **Plan:** Focus on improving lymphocyte counts.

#### Hemoglobin

*   **Finding:** Hemoglobin is 14.6 grams per deciliter.
*   **Interpretation:** While within the normal range, this represents a decline from the 56-test average since 2015 (15 g/dL) and the 2025 average (14.8 g/dL). The goal is to maintain levels around 15 g/dL to avoid age-related decline.

### Metabolic and Cardiovascular Markers

#### Beta-2 Microglobulin (B2M)

*   **Finding:** B2M is 1.53.
*   **Interpretation:** B2M is a strong predictor of the GrimAge epigenetic clock. Lower levels are generally better, as higher levels are associated with an older GrimAge. This is a new biomarker being tracked.
*   **Plan:** Continue monitoring B2M to understand optimal levels.

#### Cystatin C

*   **Finding:** Cystatin C is 0.83 milligrams per liter, the highest of the past four tests.
*   **Interpretation:** While not critically high based on reference ranges, it is moving away from the optimal level of less than 0.7 milligrams per liter, which is associated with lower all-cause mortality risk and is found in youth. It is also a predictor of GrimAge.
*   **Plan:** Continue regular testing to identify dietary and supplement strategies to lower levels.

#### Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c)

*   **Finding:** HbA1c is 5.4, the highest of eight tests since 2015.
*   **Interpretation:** While within the generally acceptable range of 5.0-5.7, higher values increase with aging and all-cause mortality risk. Lower is better.
*   **Plan:** Test HbA1c at every blood draw going forward to identify optimization strategies.

#### Fasting Glucose

*   **Finding:** Fasting glucose is 94 milligrams per deciliter.
*   **Interpretation:** This is at the upper end of the optimal range (80-94 mg/dL) but higher than the 60-test average since 2015 (around 90 mg/dL). Chronological age would predict an average of 100 mg/dL.
*   **Goal:** To maintain levels at or below the personal average of 90 mg/dL.

#### Apolipoprotein B (ApoB)

*   **Finding:** ApoB is 66 milligrams per deciliter.
*   **Interpretation:** This is below the updated benchmark for lowest heart disease mortality risk (less than 76 mg/dL) in the general population.

#### Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1)

*   **Finding:** ApoA1 is 135 milligrams per deciliter.
*   **Interpretation:** While within the lab's reference range, it is below the optimal level of greater than 150 mg/dL for lowest heart disease mortality risk.
*   **Plan:** Aim to increase ApoA1 levels.

#### ApoB/ApoA1 Ratio

*   **Finding:** The ratio is 0.49.
*   **Interpretation:** This is below the optimal restrictive ratio of less than 0.5, indicating a favorable cardiovascular risk profile.

#### Triglycerides

*   **Finding:** Triglycerides are 60 milligrams per deciliter.
*   **Interpretation:** This is above the benchmark for lowest heart disease mortality risk (less than 45 mg/dL).
*   **Plan:** Consistently aim for levels below 45 mg/dL.

#### High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) Cholesterol

*   **Finding:** HDL is 61 milligrams per deciliter.
*   **Interpretation:** This is within the optimal range of 50-60 mg/dL for men.
*   **History:** Significant improvement from previous low levels (as low as 28 mg/dL), with an average of 57 mg/dL over the last 17 tests.

#### High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP)

*   **Finding:** hs-CRP is below the detection limit at less than 0.2 milligrams per liter.
*   **Interpretation:** This marks the seventh consecutive test with hs-CRP below 0.2 mg/L, indicating very low systemic inflammation.

#### Homocysteine

*   **Finding:** Homocysteine is 9.
*   **Interpretation:** This has moved in the right direction from previous levels. Values around 5 are associated with lower all-cause mortality and dementia risk.
*   **Interventions:** Supplementation with methyl B12 (1000 mcg), methylfolate (400 mcg), and a low dose of vitamin B6 (1.5 mg) initiated three weeks prior to testing.
*   **Plan:** Further dietary adjustments will be made to attempt to lower homocysteine levels.

### Liver Function Markers

#### Albumin

*   **Finding:** Albumin is 5.0.
*   **Interpretation:** This is a positive finding, as albumin declines with aging. Maintaining levels around 5.0 is desirable.

#### Alkaline Phosphatase

*   **Finding:** Alkaline phosphatase is 45.
*   **Interpretation:** This is a good finding, as values less than 48 are associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk.

#### Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)

*   **Finding:** AST and ALT have increased, moving away from optimal high teens/low twenties.
*   **Interpretation:** Indicates potential room for improvement in liver health and function, despite other liver markers being good.

#### Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT)

*   **Finding:** GGT is 11.
*   **Interpretation:** This is a good finding, as values less than 12 are associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk. GGT is considered a better biomarker for liver disease mortality than AST and ALT.

### Other Markers

#### Immunoglobulin G (IgG) - Total

*   **Finding:** Total IgG levels were not explicitly stated with a numerical value, but its concentration is approximately 1.1 g/dL or 1100 mg/dL, making it about half of total globulins.
*   **Interpretation:** Reducing IgG has been shown to extend lifespan in mice. Interventions that reduce IgG in animal models (calorie restriction, parabiosis, exercise) also reduce IgG, suggesting a role in aging and longevity.
*   **Plan:** Include total IgG testing at every blood draw for further analysis and correlation with other biomarkers. Determining optimal levels is ongoing.
*   **Context:** IgG is a large protein circulating in the blood, significantly more concentrated than smaller biomarkers like Cystatin C.

## Future Plans and Considerations

*   Continued tracking of all biomarkers to identify optimal ranges and develop personalized intervention strategies.
*   Further research into the correlation between diet, supplements, and specific biomarker responses.
*   Upcoming videos will detail dietary changes, supplement adjustments, and in-depth analysis of biomarkers not fully covered in this report.
