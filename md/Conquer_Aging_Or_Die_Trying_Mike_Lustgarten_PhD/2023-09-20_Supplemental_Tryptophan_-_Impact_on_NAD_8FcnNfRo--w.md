# 2023-09-20 Supplemental Tryptophan - Impact on NAD

## Executive Summary

*   NAD levels decline with aging, potentially due to age-related blocks in the de novo NAD synthesis pathway.
*   Tryptophan, an amino acid, is a precursor in the de novo NAD synthesis pathway.
*   Supplementation with 2 grams of tryptophan per day did not increase NAD levels in the individual's personal trial.
*   This suggests that increasing tryptophan intake may not be an effective strategy to boost NAD levels, even if de novo synthesis is impaired.
*   Further research is planned to investigate the impact of fish oil fatty acids (EPA and DHA) on NAD levels.

## Background: NAD Decline and Synthesis Pathways

NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) levels decrease during aging. Several pathways can be targeted to potentially reverse this decline:

*   **De Novo NAD Synthesis Pathway:** This pathway begins with tryptophan.
*   **Price Handler Pathway:** Utilizes nicotinic acid (NA), which is converted to NAD through three enzymatic steps.
*   **Salvage Pathway:** Includes precursors like NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide), NAM (Niacinamide), and NR (Nicotinamide Riboside), which are also converted to NAD.

## Personal Observations with NAD Precursors

*   1000 mg/day of NMN increased personal NAD levels to 39 µmol/L (above baseline of 20-25 µmol/L).
*   654 mg/day of nicotinic acid increased personal NAD levels to 67 µmol/L (above baseline of 20-25 µmol/L).

## Investigating the De Novo NAD Synthesis Pathway

### Tryptophan and Aging

*   Tryptophan levels also decline during aging, possibly to maintain NAD homeostasis.
*   Kynurenine, a metabolite of tryptophan, increases during aging.
*   The increase in kynurenine coupled with decreasing NAD suggests a potential age-related block in the de novo pathway, hindering the conversion of kynurenine to downstream metabolites for NAD synthesis.

### Potential Limiting Factors in De Novo Synthesis

*   **Vitamin B6:** Previously explored as a potential limiting factor. Supplementation with Vitamin B6 did not affect NAD levels.
*   **Quinolinic Acid:** Increases during aging, suggesting a potential block in its conversion to NAD.
    *   Grapeseed proanthocyanidins were explored for their ability to increase Quinolinic Acid Phosphoribosyltransferase (QAPRT).
    *   However, data from grapeseed powder supplementation in personal trials did not show an increase in NAD levels. This suggests a potential absence of age-related blocks in the de novo pathway in this individual.

### Experimental Approach: Tryptophan Supplementation

To test if increasing tryptophan intake could boost NAD levels, the following experiment was conducted:

*   **Supplementation:** 2 grams of tryptophan per day.
*   **Baseline Dietary Intake:** 1 gram of tryptophan per day (resulting in a threefold increase in total intake).
*   **Analysis:** Blood sent to Genfinity for NAD level measurement.

### Results of Tryptophan Supplementation

*   NAD levels were measured at 22.3 µmol/L in the presence of 2 grams/day of tryptophan.
*   This level falls within the baseline range of 20-25 µmol/L, observed in the absence of NAD precursor supplementation.
*   **Conclusion:** Tryptophan supplementation did not impact NAD levels.

## Future Experiments

*   **Fish Oil Fatty Acids (EPA & DHA):** An upcoming experiment will investigate the impact of EPA and DHA on NAD levels. Blood was sent for analysis on September 11th, and results are pending.
*   **Nicotinic Acid:** If fish oil fatty acids do not yield positive results, a return to nicotinic acid supplementation at a lower dose is being considered.
