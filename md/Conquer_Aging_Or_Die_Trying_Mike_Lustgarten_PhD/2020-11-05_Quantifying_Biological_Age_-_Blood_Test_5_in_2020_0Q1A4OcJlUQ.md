# 2020-11-05 Quantifying Biological Age - Blood Test 5 in 2020

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age was calculated at 34.54 years, which is 12.5 years younger than the chronological age of 47.
*   A significant 5-year reduction in biological age was observed between the fourth and fifth blood tests in 2020.
*   Increased vegetable intake (broccoli, cauliflower, peas, corn) correlated with favorable changes in glucose, creatinine, and lymphocyte percentage, contributing to the age reduction.
*   Adjusted full-fat yogurt intake (reduced by half) successfully lowered glucose and creatinine while maintaining red blood cell counts in a youthful range.
*   Future dietary adjustments include increasing carrots and beets (to further lower glucose), reducing sweet potatoes (due to correlation with higher glucose), and modifying flaxseed and coconut butter intake to optimize CRP and total cholesterol levels.

## Biological Age Calculation & Trends

The latest calculation for Levine's phenotypic age (biological age) is 34.54 years. This is 12.5 years younger than the chronological age of 47.

Comparing this to previous 2020 blood tests:
*   Test 1: 34.5 years
*   Test 2: 33.4 years
*   Test 3: 35.7 years
*   Test 4: 39.3 years (the highest reading to date)
*   Test 5 (current): 34.54 years

This represents an approximate 5-year reduction in biological age from test number four to test number five. The average biological age for the five tests in 2020 is 35.5 years. This compares to an average of 35.2 years from two blood tests in 2019, suggesting a biological aging of only 0.3 years despite one full calendar year passing.

## Factors Influencing Biological Age Reduction

The period corresponding to blood test number five was from July 28 through October 27. The period for blood test number four was shorter, from June 24 through July 2020.

### Lifestyle Factors

*   **Calorie Intake & Body Weight:** Calorie intake between the two periods was not significantly different, though it was 100 calories higher per day in the period corresponding to blood test number five. This extra 100 calories per day was sufficient to increase average body weight by two pounds.
*   **Exercise Frequency:** Exercise frequency was not different between the two periods.
    *   **Exercise Coding Protocol:**
        *   Days coded as '1' included strength training, running, or biking.
        *   Walking was excluded due to its low intensity.
        *   Days with no such activities were coded as '0'.
*   **Cardiovascular Metrics:**
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) showed a small but significant improvement.
    *   Resting Heart Rate (RHR) was improved but not significantly different.
    *   A small increase in HRV is unlikely to explain a 5-year reduction in biological age, suggesting dietary components played a more significant role.

### Dietary Changes and Their Impact

Dietary intake was intentionally altered between the period corresponding to blood test number four and number five.

*   **Increased Vegetable Intake:**
    *   Vegetable intake was purposely increased by approximately 360 grams per day.
    *   Specific vegetables increased: broccoli, cauliflower, peas, and corn.
    *   **Rationale for increased vegetable intake (based on prior data):**
        *   Higher vegetable intake was negatively correlated with glucose levels: Higher average daily vegetable intake was correlated with lower glucose levels.
        *   Higher vegetable intake was negatively correlated with creatinine: Higher vegetable intake was correlated with lower creatinine. Creatinine increases with age, and higher levels are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
        *   Higher vegetable intake was positively correlated with lymphocyte percentage: Higher average daily vegetable intake was correlated with a higher percentage of lymphocytes. Lymphocyte percentage decreases with age.
        *   Conversely, higher vegetable intake was positively correlated with Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP): Higher vegetables were correlated with higher ALP, which is unfavorable as ALP increases during aging, and levels >50 are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Outcome for Blood Test 5:** Glucose, creatinine, and lymphocyte percentage all moved in the favorable direction, though it is unknown if the increased vegetable intake directly caused these improvements in this specific test.

*   **Adjusted Yogurt Intake:**
    *   Full-fat plain yogurt intake was cut by about half (from ~439 grams to ~234 grams per day).
    *   **Rationale for reduced yogurt intake (based on prior data):**
        *   **Glucose:** Glucose levels were significantly higher when yogurt was included in the diet compared to periods without yogurt.
        *   **Creatinine:** Creatinine levels were higher with yogurt in the diet compared to periods without yogurt.
        *   **Red Blood Cells (RBCs):** Yogurt intake appeared to impact red blood cell levels positively. RBC counts decrease during aging, with levels around 4.8 in men indicative of biological youth. Higher RBCs are favorable for oxygen transport. Without yogurt, RBCs were in the 4.4-4.8 range. With over 400 grams/day of yogurt, RBCs reached levels >5. With ~250 grams/day, RBCs remained above 5.
    *   **Outcome for Blood Test 5:**
        *   The target of ~250 grams of yogurt per day was implemented.
        *   Red blood cell levels were maintained relatively high at 4.97.
        *   Creatinine levels were reduced to their lowest level in 2020 (0.93 dL).
        *   Glucose levels improved from 99 to 96, but are still above the optimal range of 80-94.

## Strategies for Future Improvements

### Optimizing Glucose Levels

Additional factors affecting glucose levels need to be identified.

*   **Sweet Potatoes vs. Carrots:**
    *   A dietary change was previously made from carrots to orange sweet potatoes to achieve ~55,000 micrograms of beta-carotene daily, believing carrots' high sucrose content would be detrimental.
    *   However, prior data indicates:
        *   Higher average daily sweet potato intake is significantly correlated with higher glucose levels.
        *   Higher carrot intake is negatively correlated with glucose levels (i.e., correlated with lower glucose).
*   **Beets:**
    *   Past data shows that when beets were included in the diet, average glucose levels were almost always less than 90. When beets were absent or in very low amounts, glucose levels were consistently higher than 90.
*   **Proposed Dietary Changes for Next Blood Test (Glucose Focus):**
    *   Increase carrot intake to a pound or more per day.
    *   Reduce the frequency of eating orange sweet potatoes.
    *   Reintroduce raw beets into the diet at approximately 120-150 grams per day (4-5 ounces) via smoothies.

### Reducing CRP

The current CRP level (0.84) is approximately double the usual level and above the 0.3 threshold associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.

*   **Food Correlations with CRP (prior data):**
    *   **Flaxseed:** Higher average daily flaxseed intake (up to ~12 grams/day) is significantly correlated with higher CRP levels (correlation of 0.71).
    *   **Coconut Butter:** Higher levels of coconut butter (a mix of coconut meat and milk, not oil) were correlated with lower CRP levels, though this correlation was not statistically significant (p=0.08).
*   **Biomarker Correlations with CRP (prior data):**
    *   **Total Cholesterol:** Higher total cholesterol levels are correlated with lower CRP levels. The current total cholesterol is 133, suggesting room for improvement.
    *   **Coconut Butter and Total Cholesterol:** Higher levels of coconut butter are correlated with higher total cholesterol.

*   **Proposed Dietary Changes for Next Blood Test (CRP Focus):**
    *   Reduce flaxseed intake.
    *   Increase coconut butter intake from ~20 grams per day to 35-40 grams per day.
    *   **Hypothesized Pathway:** `Increased Coconut Butter -> Increased Total Cholesterol -> Decreased CRP`
