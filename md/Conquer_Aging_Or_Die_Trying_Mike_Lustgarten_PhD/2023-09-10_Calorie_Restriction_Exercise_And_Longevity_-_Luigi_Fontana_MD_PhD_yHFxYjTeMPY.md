# 2023-09-10 Calorie Restriction Exercise And Longevity - Luigi Fontana MD PhD

## Executive Summary

*   Calorie restriction (CR) in humans, as observed in the "Cronies" study, elicits similar metabolic and hormonal adaptations seen in animal models, with the notable exception of IGF-1 levels.
*   While exercise significantly improves healthspan and insulin sensitivity, it does not appear to be the primary driver of maximal lifespan extension, unlike calorie restriction.
*   Overtraining and excessive exercise, particularly without optimal nutrition, can lead to negative health consequences, including increased risk of fibrosis and arrhythmias.
*   Hyperinsulinemia, often preceding elevated blood glucose, is a major driver of aging and age-related diseases, stemming from chronic overconsumption and constant activation of growth pathways.
*   The "real" Mediterranean diet, in its historical context, was predominantly plant-based with minimal meat and alcohol, contrasting with modern interpretations that often promote excessive olive oil and wine consumption.

## Introduction to Luigi Fontana's Work

Dr. Luigi Fontana is a physician scientist and Professor of Medicine and Nutrition at the University of Sydney, Australia. His research focuses on healthy longevity, with extensive work on calorie restriction and its effects on metabolism, hormones, and cellular aging in both animal models and humans. He has authored over 240 peer-reviewed papers and two books on longevity.

## Calorie Restriction Studies: Cronies and CALERI

### Cronies Study (Cross-Sectional)

*   **Design:** Compared individuals practicing calorie restriction with optimal nutrition (CRON) for an average of 15 years ("Cronies") against age and sex-matched endurance master athletes and sedentary individuals consuming typical Western diets.
*   **Findings:** Demonstrated metabolic and hormonal adaptations similar to those observed in animal CR studies, including:
    *   Reduced triiodothyronine (T3).
    *   Reduced testosterone and estrogens.
    *   Reduced leptin.
    *   Increased adiponectin (including high molecular weight adiponectin).
    *   Increased cortisol.
    *   Significant increase in IGF-binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) and IGFBP-2.
    *   No change in Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1).
    *   Reduced inflammation.
    *   Improved cholesterol profiles (increased HDL, reduced LDL).
    *   Improved insulin sensitivity and reduced fasting glucose.
    *   Downregulation of the insulin/IGF-1 pathway at the molecular level (increased FOXO, reduced AKT phosphorylation).
    *   Increased markers of autophagy (e.g., H270, Beclin-1, LC3).
    *   Increased markers of protein quality control (chaperones like Hsp70).
    *   Reduced markers of cellular senescence (e.g., p16, p21, IL-6).

### CALERI Study (Randomized Clinical Trial)

*   **Phase 1:** Studied individuals aged 50-60 years who were overweight.
*   **Phase 2:** A multicenter study involving individuals aged 20-50 years with a BMI between 22-28 (slightly overweight).
    *   **Baseline BMI:** Average 25.
    *   **Post-CR BMI (after 2 years):** Average 22.5.
*   **Findings:** Confirmed many adaptations seen in the Cronies study, notably a sustained increase in IGFBP-1 without a change in IGF-1. The average BMI of the Cronies (19.6) was significantly lower than the average BMI achieved in CALERI phase 2.

### Key Exception: IGF-1

*   A hallmark of CR in rodents is a significant reduction in IGF-1, which is strongly linked to increased lifespan.
*   In humans, CR does not consistently reduce IGF-1. Instead, it increases IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2, which reduce IGF-1 bioavailability.
*   This suggests a potential difference in the role or regulation of IGF-1 between rodents and humans regarding longevity.

## Exercise and Longevity

*   **Healthspan Benefits:** Exercise is essential and significantly improves healthspan, insulin sensitivity (more so than CR), HDL cholesterol, and reduces triglycerides. It also positively impacts other pathways like GLUT4 and BDNF.
*   **Longevity Driver Limitation:** Exercise alone does not appear to be the primary driver of maximal lifespan extension. While it can increase median lifespan and improve quality of life, its impact on reaching maximal biological limits is less pronounced than CR.
*   **Hormonal Adaptations:** Exercise, especially resistance training, can increase testosterone and IGF-1, counteracting some hormonal adaptations seen with CR. It does not typically trigger reductions in T3 or IGF-1.
*   **Risks of Overtraining:**
    *   Can lead to increased cortisol, fibrosis in the heart, and potentially arrhythmias due to patchy fibrosis affecting the conductive system.
    *   Can cause wear and tear on joints, leading to issues like joint replacement surgery.
    *   Excessive exercise can impair glucose tolerance and mitochondrial function.
    *   Historical studies on rats showed that while exercise increased median lifespan, calorie restriction in weight-paired animals extended both median and maximal lifespan.
*   **Optimal Dose:** The "more is better" approach to exercise is often detrimental. A U-shaped relationship exists, where excessive exercise can be harmful. A dose of one hour per day, six days a week at 72% of max heart rate was shown to reduce visceral fat by 40% in overweight individuals without calorie changes.

## Optimal Human Calorie Restriction

*   **Unknown Optimal Dose:** The precise optimal level of calorie restriction for humans remains unknown and likely varies individually.
*   **Biomarker Need:** Development of personalized biomarkers is crucial to fine-tune optimal caloric intake, protein intake, and exercise.
*   **Risk of Excessive CR:** Data suggests that excessively severe calorie restriction can paradoxically accelerate biological aging, as indicated by DNA methylation clocks.
*   **Moderate Approach:** Until precise biomarkers are available, a moderate approach to calorie intake and exercise is recommended.
*   **Monitoring:** Key biomarkers to monitor include blood pressure, resting heart rate, fasting glucose, lipids, insulin, and potentially continuous glucose monitors (CGM) to detect impairments in glucose tolerance.
    *   **Fasting Insulin:** A key indicator. Low fasting insulin (around 2 µU/mL) is characteristic of CRON individuals and master athletes, while typical individuals may have fasting insulin levels of 8 µU/mL or higher.
    *   **Fasting Glucose:** Ideally below 85 mg/dL. Rising glucose levels often indicate a prolonged period of insulin resistance.

## Key Drivers of Aging and Disease

### Hyperinsulinemia

*   **Cause:** Chronic overconsumption of food, leading to a constant postprandial state.
*   **Mechanism:** Constant bombardment of insulin receptors activates pathways like PI3K/AKT, inhibiting beneficial pathways such as FOXO translocation, autophagy, and DNA repair. It also activates cell proliferation pathways (e.g., Cyclin D).
*   **Consequences:**
    *   Increased risk of cancer (due to increased cell proliferation and random mutations).
    *   Increased cell senescence.
    *   Reduced bioavailability of IGF-1, testosterone, and estrogens, which are growth factors and implicated in cancer.
    *   Accumulation of molecular damage.
*   **Comparison:** Hyperinsulinemia is considered a more powerful driver of aging and disease than smoking or alcohol consumption.

### IGF-1

*   **Role in Aging:** While low IGF-1 is linked to longevity in rodents, human data is more complex. A U-shaped curve suggests both too low and too high IGF-1 may be associated with increased mortality risk.
*   **Reverse Causation Hypothesis:** The decline in IGF-1 observed in some aging individuals may be due to a failure to secrete growth hormone as a consequence of accumulated damage, rather than the low IGF-1 being the primary cause of aging.
*   **Bioavailability:** The increase in IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 with CR reduces IGF-1 bioavailability, which is a key adaptation.

### Glucose and Glycation

*   **Glucose Itself:** Studies suggest that glucose levels *per se* may not be the primary driver of aging. Overexpression of GLUT4 in animals did not extend lifespan, but CR did.
*   **Insulin Resistance:** The underlying insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia that often precede elevated glucose are considered major drivers.
*   **Glycation:** Chronically high glucose levels lead to glycation of proteins, causing damage to arteries, heart, and kidneys. This is considered more a disease-related consequence than a primary aging mechanism.

### Other Factors

*   **Alcohol:** Chronic alcohol intake leads to inflammation, potential fibrosis, and increased risk of cancer (due to acetaldehyde).
*   **Dietary Propaganda:** Misconceptions about diets like the "Mediterranean diet" (often promoting excessive wine and olive oil) and Okinawa diet (fish consumption) are common due to marketing and simplification.

## The "Real" Mediterranean Diet

*   **Historical Context:** Primarily plant-based, featuring homemade bread and pasta from durum wheat, chickpeas, lentils, abundant fresh vegetables, some fruit, nuts, and small fish (like sardines) preserved for year-round consumption.
*   **Limited Animal Products:** Meat was consumed very rarely (twice a month), and cheese/eggs were consumed in moderation.
*   **Minimal Alcohol and Olive Oil:** Wine was consumed sparsely, perhaps a glass during festivities, not daily. Olive oil was used in very small quantities, not liters as in modern interpretations.

## Rethinking Health and Longevity

### The Unavoidability of Death and Existential Concerns

*   **Population Limits:** Indefinite lifespan extension for the entire human population is considered unsustainable due to finite planetary resources (food, water, land), leading to inevitable conflict and resource scarcity.
*   **Environmental Catastrophe:** The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (flooding, fires) pose an existential threat, impacting food security and global stability.
*   **Spiritual Connection:** A lack of connection to spirituality, nature, and the true meaning of life is identified as a societal problem.
*   **Philosophical Perspective on Death:** Death is viewed not as an end, but a transformation of energy and form, part of a universal cycle. The focus should be on living in harmony with natural laws.

### The Unhealthy "Sick Care" System

*   **Disease-Centric Model:** The current healthcare system is largely disease-centric, profiting from treating illness rather than preventing it.
*   **Unsustainable Costs:** Healthcare spending is exorbitant and increasing, with poor health outcomes (e.g., decreasing lifespan expectancy in the US despite massive spending).
*   **Failed Analogy:** Treating chronic diseases after they occur is likened to neglecting maintenance on an expensive car, leading to inevitable failure.

### Towards a Lifestyle Medicine Paradigm

*   **Holistic Approach:** There is sufficient knowledge to prevent 90% of chronic diseases through lifestyle interventions.
*   **Integration into Primary Care:** Lifestyle medicine, incorporating nutrition, exercise, and mental well-being, needs to be integrated into primary healthcare.
*   **Key Components of a Lifestyle Medicine Clinic:**
    *   Chef in residence for healthy, tasty cooking education.
    *   Exercise physiologist for personalized exercise guidance.
    *   Mental/emotional health support.
    *   Use of e-health platforms and apps for monitoring and personalized feedback.
*   **Goal:** To shift from a "sick care" model to a health promotion model, enabling individuals to reduce or eliminate medications and achieve long, healthy lives.

### Educational Reform

*   **Mandatory Health Education:** Concepts of healthy longevity, optimal nutrition, and lifestyle choices should be integrated into curricula from primary school through university, becoming ingrained societal knowledge.
*   **Flipping Mindsets:** Countering the notion that healthy eating is "tasting" and promoting the idea that real food is the foundation of well-being.

## Research and Future Projects

*   **Reversing Atherosclerosis:** Combination therapy using diet (e.g., 5:2 Pesco-vegetarian diet), exercise, and meditation to reverse arterial plaques and improve cardiac microcirculation.
*   **Fasting and Chemotherapy:** Investigating the efficacy of fasting combined with ketogenic diets to protect normal cells from chemotherapy damage in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
*   **Autophagy Induction:** Studying the effects of 3-day water-only fasting, with or without exercise, on inducing autophagy and DNA repair pathways in humans, as robust human data is currently lacking.
*   **Charles Perkins Centre RPA Clinic:** Establishing a "Healthy for Life" program integrating lifestyle medicine, education, and clinical services.
*   **E-Health Platform:** Developing an app to monitor individual health interventions, integrate with sensors (CGM, etc.), and track metabolic changes.

## Key Learnings and Recommendations

*   **Moderation is Key:** Avoid extremes in calorie restriction and exercise.
*   **Personalization:** Individual responses vary; biomarkers are essential for optimal adjustments.
*   **Prioritize Nutrition:** Focus on high-quality, high-fiber foods.
*   **Monitor Health Markers:** Regularly check blood pressure, resting heart rate, fasting glucose, lipids, and insulin.
*   **Reframe Health:** Shift from a disease-treatment mindset to a proactive health-creation approach.
*   **Embrace Lifestyle Medicine:** Integrate diet, exercise, and mental well-being into daily life.
*   **Be Skeptical of Quick Fixes:** Longevity is a holistic, long-term pursuit, not a quick diet trend.
