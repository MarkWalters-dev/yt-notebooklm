# 2025-03-18 Aging By AutoDigestion - Improved By Calorie Restriction And Fasting Clip

## Executive Summary
*   Reduced calorie intake minimizes intestinal damage caused by self-digestion (auto-digestion) following meals.
*   The intestinal barrier is in a constant state of repair, requiring approximately two days for full restoration of intestinal villi.
*   Proteolytic activity, indicating the escape of digestive enzymes into the blood, is a transient, time-dependent phenomenon influenced by meal size and content.
*   Calorie restriction (e.g., 40% reduction) significantly extends lifespan in mice, associating lifespan extension with dietary patterns that incorporate fasting periods allowing for repair.
*   New technology utilizing finger-prick blood samples is being developed to measure this transient proteolytic activity in real-time.

## Intestinal Repair and Auto-Digestion Dynamics

The core concept involves the damage inflicted upon the intestinal lining (villi) by the body's own digestive enzymes (auto-digestion) immediately following a meal.

*   **Damage Minimization:** Consuming fewer calories, or spacing out eating through timed feeding protocols, reduces the frequency and magnitude of damage to the intestine per meal.
*   **Constant Repair Mechanism:** The intestine possesses the highest gene expression rate in the body and maintains a continuous repair mechanism, supported by ample stem cells located in the submucosa.
*   **Repair Timeline:** It takes approximately two days for the intestinal villi to fully restore themselves after damage.
*   **Functionality Threshold:** A functioning intestine requires the villi to seal to protect the body from its own digestive enzymes. The length of the villi (which determines nutrient absorption efficiency) is secondary to this protective seal.

## Measuring Proteolytic Activity

The escape of digestive enzymes into the bloodstream represents a measurable marker of intestinal barrier compromise (auto-digestion).

*   **Technological Development:** A new technology, developed in collaboration with Mike Heller (UCSD), allows for the measurement of proteolytic activity in a whole blood sample using small finger-prick samples and fluorescent units.
*   **Nature of Measurement:** Elevated proteolytic activity is observed in subjects (animals or humans) at risk. This activity is **transient** (time-dependent), similar to glucose measurements, meaning a single reading provides limited information; following the time course is essential.
*   **Research Need:** Determining the precise time course—when the barrier opens post-meal and how long it takes to repair—is crucial for establishing rational bases for timed eating experiments.

## Calorie Restriction and Lifespan Extension (Mouse Data)

Data from mouse models strongly links dietary intervention with improved longevity by mitigating auto-digestion effects.

*   Mice subjected to **40% calorie restriction** exhibit approximately **30% longer lifespan**.
*   A successful lifespan extension protocol in these mice involves consuming triple their usual caloric intake on one day (e.g., Friday) followed by a complete fast on the subsequent two days (Saturday and Sunday).
*   This pattern suggests that the two subsequent days of fasting provide sufficient time for the intestinal barrier to fully repair the damage incurred during the high-calorie intake day, preventing long-term detriment from the auto-digestion perspective.
