# 2023-10-15 Acylcarnitines Increase During Aging And Are Associated With Poor Health

## Executive Summary

*   Circulating acylcarnitines, which are fatty acids bound to carnitine, can serve as an index of mitochondrial function.
*   Higher levels of certain medium and long-chain acylcarnitines are associated with a significantly increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).
*   Acylcarnitines are elevated in Alzheimer's disease patients compared to healthy controls and are also linked to an increased risk of all-cause mortality.
*   Specific acylcarnitines identified as markers of poor health and aging also demonstrably increase with age.
*   At-home metabolomic kits can measure a wide range of acylcarnitines, allowing for tracking and potential optimization of these metabolites.

## Acylcarnitines: Definition and Role in Mitochondrial Function

Acylcarnitines are formed by the binding of fatty acids to carnitine.

*   **Mechanism of Accumulation:** A blockage in mitochondrial beta-oxidation leads to the accumulation of acylcarnitines and free fatty acids.
*   **Consequences of Accumulation:** This accumulation contributes to lipotoxicity in tissues such as the heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and brain.
*   **Lipotoxicity-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction:**
    *   Altered mitochondrial morphology (changes in size and shape).
    *   Bioenergetic dysfunction (decreased ATP production).
    *   Induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.
    *   Increased oxidative stress.

## Acylcarnitines and Cardiovascular Health

Certain acylcarnitines are associated with an increased incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as non-fatal stroke, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular surgical procedures, and cardiovascular death.

*   **Study Design:** Principal component analysis was performed on 49 metabolites in a study of 85-year-old individuals, identifying metabolite-containing factors associated with MACE 3.5 years later.
*   **Key Findings:**
    *   Factor Seven, primarily containing alanine, was associated with a 2.18-fold increased risk of MACE.
    *   Factor One, containing medium and long-chain acylcarnitines (including C2, C6, C8), was associated with a 77% increased risk of MACE. (Note: The study's categorization of C2 and C6 as medium/long-chain is technically inaccurate; they are short-chain. This factor likely includes short, medium, and long-chain acylcarnitines, and potentially unsaturated variants).

## Acylcarnitines in Neurodegenerative Disease and Mortality

Acylcarnitines are implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and all-cause mortality.

*   **Alzheimer's Disease:** Plasma levels of eight different acylcarnitines were significantly higher in AD patients compared to healthy controls.
*   **Association with MACE:** Seven of these eight acylcarnitines were also associated with an increased risk of MACE, suggesting a link to poor health outcomes.
*   **All-Cause Mortality:** A study investigating plasma metabolites and the risk of all-cause mortality identified three acylcarnitines (C14, C16, and C18 unsaturated versions) associated with increased risk. This was replicated across two independent cohorts (MDCCC and MPP reexamination studies), highlighting their potential as markers of poor health.

## Age-Related Changes in Acylcarnitines

Acylcarnitines associated with poor health outcomes and aging also increase with age.

*   **C18:1 Acylcarnitine:** This acylcarnitine showed a clear increase with age in the 45-85 year range across both studied cohorts (NDCCC and MPP reexamination).
*   **General Aging Trend:** In a study comparing individuals with an average age of 97 years to those with an average age of 67 years, 12 out of 14 acylcarnitines previously linked to cardiovascular events, AD, or all-cause mortality were significantly higher in the older group. The exception was C18:2 octadecadienylcarnitine.

## Tracking and Optimizing Acylcarnitines

Acylcarnitines can be tracked using at-home metabolomic kits.

*   **Metabolomic Kits:** These kits can measure a broad spectrum of metabolites, including a significant number of acylcarnitines (e.g., 38 in one mentioned kit).
*   **Personal Data Example:** The presenter's own data from three tests shows variability in the sum of 14 acylcarnitines, with a goal of keeping these levels low to avoid age-related increases and associations with poor health.
*   **Optimization Goal:** The aim is to avoid the age-related increase in these acylcarnitines and maintain them towards the lower end of the measured range. Further research is planned to understand individual acylcarnitine changes and health effects.
