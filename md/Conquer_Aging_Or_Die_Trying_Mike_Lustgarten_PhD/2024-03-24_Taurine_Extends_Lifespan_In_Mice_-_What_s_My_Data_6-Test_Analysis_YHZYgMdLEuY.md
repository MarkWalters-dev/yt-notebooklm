# 2024-03-24 Taurine Extends Lifespan In Mice - What's My Data 6-Test Analysis

## Executive Summary

*   Taurine supplementation extended median lifespan in both male and female mice in a previous study.
*   Serum taurine levels decline with age in mice, monkeys, and humans.
*   Personal plasma taurine levels are currently 113 micromolar, which is higher than the age-expected level of 65 micromolar.
*   Higher plasma taurine levels are observed in infants, suggesting potential for further increases.
*   Intake of coconut butter and saturated fatty acids is positively correlated with plasma taurine levels.

## Mouse Data: Taurine and Lifespan

A prior study demonstrated that taurine deficiency is a driver of aging. Specifically, serum taurine levels decrease as organisms age, observed in mice, monkeys, and humans. To investigate causation, young mice were supplemented with taurine. In both female and male mice, taurine supplementation resulted in an extended median lifespan.

## Personal Taurine Levels and Age Expectation

Analysis of six personal metabolomic tests using IOLO's kit revealed the following:

*   **2023 Average Plasma Taurine:** 0.113 millimolar (113 micromolar)
*   **Early February 2024 Plasma Taurine:** 0.11 millimolar (110 micromolar)

Comparing these levels to age-expected data:

*   **Age-Expected Average Taurine (based on chronological age):** 65 micromolar
*   **Current Personal Level:** 113 micromolar

The current personal plasma taurine level of 113 micromolar is significantly higher than the age-expected level of 65 micromolar, indicating resistance to age-related decline. However, even higher levels are observed in infants, suggesting potential for further optimization.

## Diet and Plasma Taurine Correlation

The study explored the correlation between dietary intake and plasma taurine levels, aiming to identify strategies to resist age-related decline.

**Methodology:**

*   Since 2015, all food intake has been weighed and entered into Chronometer.
*   Daily food amounts are tracked, and then averaged for the period preceding each blood test.
*   This creates a corresponding dietary intake for each blood test.
*   Sufficient tests and tracked dietary data allow for the calculation of correlations.
*   Significant correlations (p-value < 0.05) are followed as closely as possible to improve biomarkers.

**Top Correlations (out of 90 comparisons):**

*   **Coconut Butter:** Positively correlated with plasma taurine levels. Higher intake is associated with higher taurine.
*   **Saturated Fatty Acids (SFA):** Positively correlated with plasma taurine levels. Higher intake is associated with higher taurine.

*Note: Coconut butter is the primary source of saturated fat in the diet, hence the near identity of these two findings.*

## Dietary Adjustments and Future Monitoring

To maintain or further increase plasma taurine levels:

*   **Goal:** Aim for the higher end of the intake range for coconut butter and saturated fatty acids.
*   **Recent Adjustment:** In the three weeks prior to the March 2024 metabolomic test, saturated fat intake was increased to an average of 25 grams per day, compared to 19 grams per day for the previous test. This was done in conjunction with the LDL, Need, and Pace experiment.
*   **Next Steps:** Results from the second 2024 metabolomic test are pending. The correlation analysis will be recalculated after receiving these results. If the correlation for coconut butter and saturated fatty acids weakens, it may indicate these are not the primary drivers. The strategy will be adjusted accordingly to improve taurine levels without negatively impacting other biomarkers.

Results are expected by the end of the month, with an update video to follow.
