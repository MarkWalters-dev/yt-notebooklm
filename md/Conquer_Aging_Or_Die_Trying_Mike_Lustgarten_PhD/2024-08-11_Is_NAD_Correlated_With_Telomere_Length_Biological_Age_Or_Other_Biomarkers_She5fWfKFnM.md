# 2024-08-11 Is NAD Correlated With Telomere Length Biological Age Or Other Biomarkers

## Executive Summary
*   Blood intracellular NAD levels showed **no statistically significant correlation** with epigenetic telomere length ($p=0.75$).
*   NAD levels were **not significantly correlated** with the epigenetic clocks Dunedin Pace ($p=0.36$) or Horvath's Epigenetic Age ($p=0.24$).
*   PhenoAge showed a desirable directional trend (higher NAD associated with younger PhenoAge), but the correlation was **not statistically significant** ($p=0.6$).
*   Significant **inverse correlations** were found between NAD and liver enzymes (AST + ALT sum) and LDL cholesterol.
*   Significant **positive correlations** were found between NAD and platelets (desirable) and Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) (undesirable).

## NAD and Hallmarks of Aging
NAD decline is implicated in multiple hallmarks of aging, including:
*   Cell senescence
*   Mitochondrial dysfunction
*   DNA damage

## Correlation Analysis with Biological Age Measures (11 Tests)

The analysis assesses the correlation between blood intracellular NAD levels and various measures of biological age and telomere length derived from epigenetic testing (True Diagnostic, Giinfinity).

### 1. Telomere Length vs. NAD
*   **Test Method:** Epigenetic estimation of telomere length (y-axis) vs. blood intracellular NAD (x-axis).
*   **Result:** The correlation was **not statistically significant** ($p=0.75$).
*   **Trend:** The trend line showed a slight inverse relationship (higher NAD suggested shorter telomere length), but this was non-significant.

### 2. Dunedin Pace vs. NAD
*   **Context:** Dunedin Pace is highlighted as a key epigenetic clock for measuring the epigenetic speed of aging.
*   **Result:** The correlation was **not statistically significant** ($p=0.36$).
*   **Trend:** The trend line suggested that higher NAD correlated with a higher Dunedin Pace (undesirable direction), but this was non-significant.

### 3. Horvath's Epigenetic Age vs. NAD
*   **Result:** The trend line indicated a favorable direction (higher NAD correlated with a younger Horvath's age), but the correlation was **not statistically significant** ($p=0.24$).

### 4. PhenoAge vs. NAD
*   **Context:** PhenoAge is a clinical chemistry-based biological age calculator (including albumin, creatinine, glucose, hsCRP).
*   **Result (Initial):** The trend line showed a favorable direction (higher NAD correlated with a younger PhenoAge), but the correlation was **not statistically significant** ($p=0.6$).
*   **Outlier Impact:** Removing a single NAD data point above $60 \mu M$ (potential outlier) improved the correlation magnitude (from $r=-0.18$ to $r=-0.39$) but the P-value remained non-significant ($p=0.26$).
*   **Conclusion:** NAD was not significantly correlated with PhenoAge across 11 tests, even after outlier removal.

### Summary of Epigenetic Measures
Across telomere length, Dunedin Pace, Horvath's Age, and PhenoAge, NAD showed **no significant correlation** in this dataset of 11 tests.

### Data Collection Limitations
A recognized limitation is the sparse data points for high NAD levels:
*   Only one data point existed in the $30-60 \mu M$ range previously.
*   The plan to increase nicotinic acid supplementation aims to generate more data points between $20 \mu M$ and $60+\mu M$ for better analysis.

## Correlation Analysis with Clinical Biomarkers (Approx. 25 Biomarkers)

NAD levels were tested against approximately 25 standard clinical chemistry panel biomarkers.

### Significant Inverse Correlations (Higher NAD $\rightarrow$ Lower Biomarker)
*   **AST + ALT Sum:** Higher NAD was significantly correlated with lower levels of the combined liver enzymes AST and ALT. Lower levels of these enzymes (especially approaching 40 and above) are associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk.
*   **LDL Cholesterol:** Higher NAD was significantly correlated with lower LDL levels, potentially beneficial for heart disease mortality risk.

### Significant Positive Correlations (Higher NAD $\rightarrow$ Higher Biomarker)
*   **Platelets:** Higher NAD correlated positively with higher platelet counts. This is potentially beneficial as platelet counts decline during aging, suggesting NAD might resist this decline if causative.
*   **Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP):** Higher NAD correlated positively with higher SBP. This is concerning as SBP increases with aging. This raises a question about potential vascular inflammation resulting from the nicotinic acid supplementation used to boost NAD levels.

## Methodology Note
The participant utilizes direct-to-consumer lab testing services (e.g., Ulta Labs in the US) to acquire blood data without physician intervention, allowing for frequent, self-directed testing.
