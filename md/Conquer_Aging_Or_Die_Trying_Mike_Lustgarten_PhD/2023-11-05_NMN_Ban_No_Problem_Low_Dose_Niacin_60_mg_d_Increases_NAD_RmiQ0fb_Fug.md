# 2023-11-05 NMN Ban No Problem Low Dose Niacin 60 mg d Increases NAD

## Executive Summary

*   Supplementing with 60 mg/day of nicotinic acid for 10 days increased NAD levels to 38 micromolar, surpassing the typical baseline of around 25 micromolar.
*   This low dose of nicotinic acid was as effective at raising NAD levels as a significantly higher dose of 1000 mg/day of NMN, which increased NAD to 39 micromolar in previous tests.
*   A prior high-dose nicotinic acid regimen (600 mg/day) raised NAD to 67 micromolar but was associated with a less favorable epigenetic pace of aging (Dunedin Pace of 0.98).
*   NAD levels without any precursor supplementation typically ranged around or below 25.6 micromolar.
*   The effect of this low-dose nicotinic acid on the epigenetic pace of aging (Dunedin PACE) is currently being investigated.

## Background: High-Dose Nicotinic Acid and Epigenetic Aging

In a previous test, supplementing with 600 mg/day of nicotinic acid increased NAD levels to 67 micromolar, which was approximately two to three times higher than the individual's baseline of at most 25 micromolar. However, on the same day as that NAD test, epigenetic analysis showed a Dunedin Pace of Aging of 0.98, indicating a less favorable aging rate. This observation prompted an investigation into whether a lower dose of nicotinic acid could raise NAD without negatively impacting epigenetic aging.

## Study Protocol: Low-Dose Nicotinic Acid

To determine if low-dose nicotinic acid could increase NAD without adversely affecting epigenetic markers, the following protocol was implemented:

*   **Supplement:** 60 milligrams of nicotinic acid (a tenfold lower dose than the previous high-dose experiment).
*   **Duration:** 10 consecutive days.
*   **Analysis:** Blood samples were sent for NAD analysis.

## Results: Low-Dose Nicotinic Acid and NAD Levels

Following the 10-day supplementation with 60 mg/day of nicotinic acid, NAD levels were measured at 38 micromolar. This level is above the individual's established baseline of approximately 25 micromolar.

## Comparison with NMN Supplementation

The increase in NAD levels from 60 mg/day of nicotinic acid was comparable to that observed with a significantly higher dose of NMN:

*   **Baseline NAD (without precursors):** 25.6 micromolar.
*   **300 mg/day NMN:** No significant increase in NAD levels.
*   **1000 mg/day NMN:** Increased NAD levels to 39 micromolar.
*   **60 mg/day Nicotinic Acid:** Increased NAD levels to 38 micromolar.

This data indicates that, in this individual's case, 60 mg/day of nicotinic acid was as effective as 1000 mg/day of NMN in raising NAD levels.

## Other Interventions Influencing NAD Levels

Beyond the current study, various interventions have been tested to increase NAD levels above the 25 micromolar baseline. While six tests without NAD precursors resulted in levels below 25 micromolar, five tests demonstrated NAD levels exceeding this threshold:

*   **1000 mg/day NMN:** Increased NAD to 39 micromolar.
*   **60 mg/day Nicotinic Acid:** Increased NAD to 38 micromolar.
*   **9 mg/day Vitamin B6:** Raised NAD above 25 micromolar, a relatively low dose that did not negatively impact other biomarkers.
*   **600 mg/day Nicotinic Acid:** Increased NAD to 67 micromolar.
*   **600 mg/day Nicotinic Acid + Tryptophan:** This combination was utilized in an attempt to maximize NAD production through the *de novo* NAD synthesis pathway.

## Future Research: Epigenetic Impact of Low-Dose Nicotinic Acid

While low-dose nicotinic acid has been shown to increase NAD, its impact on the epigenetic pace of aging (Dunedin PACE) remains unknown. Blood samples have been submitted for analysis, with results expected in the coming months, which will shed light on whether this low-dose regimen affects epigenetic aging markers.
