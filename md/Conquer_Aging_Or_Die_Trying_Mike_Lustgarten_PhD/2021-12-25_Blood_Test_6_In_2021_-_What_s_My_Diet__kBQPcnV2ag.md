# 2021-12-25 Blood Test 6 In 2021 - What's My Diet

## Executive Summary

*   **Spermidine Intake:** A daily intake of 166 grams of mushrooms yields approximately 11.8 mg of spermidine per day, aligning with research indicating reduced all-cause mortality risk at intakes greater than 11.6 mg/day.
*   **Whole Grain Increase:** Cumulative daily intake of corn, oats, and barley increased from 32g to 154g, a five-fold increase, to address rising glucose levels.
*   **Fat Intake Correlation with Glucose:** Higher total fat intake is significantly correlated with higher fasting glucose levels, prompting a reduction in fat intake.
*   **Carbohydrate Intake Correlation with Glucose:** Higher average daily carbohydrate intake, particularly from fiber-rich sources, is significantly correlated with lower fasting glucose levels.
*   **Fat Intake Impact on Biomarkers:** A higher average daily fat intake is significantly correlated with 11 of 23 "big picture" biomarkers moving in a direction associated with aging and increased all-cause mortality risk.

## Supplements

*   **Levothyroxine:** 137.5 micrograms per day (for over 20 years, due to hypothyroidism diagnosis in twenties).
*   **Methyl B12:** 1000 micrograms every three days (approx. 300 micrograms/day) to reduce homocysteine.

## Average Fitness Stats (November 1 - December 12, 2021)

*   **Period:** 42 days
*   **Average Body Weight:** 155 lbs (approx. 70 kg)
*   **Resting Heart Rate (RHR):** 42 beats per minute (BPM)
*   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** 50 milliseconds

**Comparison with Previous Blood Test (September 2 - October 31, 2021):**

*   **Body Weight:** Small statistically significant decrease in the current period.
*   **Resting Heart Rate:** Small statistically significant increase in the current period.
*   **Heart Rate Variability:** Small statistically significant reduction in the current period.

**Impact on Biological Age:** These small alterations in body weight and cardiovascular metrics did not significantly affect biological age:
*   **Levine's Phenotypic Age:** Approximately 37.1 years (similar to previous test).
*   **Aging.ai:** 29 years (decreased from 30 years in the previous test).

## Diet Analysis (Average Daily Intake Over 42 Days)

The following is a ranked list of average daily food intake in grams per day, with green tea in ounces.

1.  **Ranked Foods:**
    *   Mushrooms: 166g (Yielding approx. 11.8 mg spermidine)
    *   ... (Other foods not detailed in transcript for their abundance)

### Spermidine Focus

*   **Source:** Mushrooms (166g/day).
*   **Spermidine Yield:** ~11.8 mg/day.
*   **Importance:** Spermidine has been shown to increase lifespan in Little (dwarf) mice. In humans, a spermidine intake greater than 11.6 mg/day was associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk over a 20-year follow-up.

### Whole Grain Intake Focus

*   **Notable Changes:** Increased cumulative intake of corn, oats, and barley.
*   **Current Average Daily Intake (Corn, Oats, Barley Combined):** 154g/day.
*   **Previous Average Daily Intake (Corn Only):** 32g/day.
*   **Increase:** Five-fold increase in combined whole grain intake.

## Glucose Levels and Macronutrient Correlations

### Glucose Trend Over 6+ Years

*   **Observation:** Glucose levels have been increasing over a 6.5-year period.
*   **Current Trend:** Glucose levels have been greater than 90 mg/dL for the last 15 consecutive blood tests.
*   **Implication:** Increasing glucose levels during aging are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.

### Macronutrient Correlations with Glucose

*   **Total Calorie Intake:** Not statistically significantly correlated with glucose levels (p-value = 0.88).
*   **Total Fat Intake:** Strongest statistically significant positive correlation with glucose levels (higher fat intake = higher glucose).
*   **Average Daily Carbohydrate Intake:** Statistically significant inverse correlation with glucose levels (higher carbohydrate intake = lower glucose).
    *   **Caveat:** Carbohydrate intake is primarily from fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and legumes, which are fiber-rich.
*   **Fiber Intake:** Statistically significant inverse correlation with glucose levels (higher fiber intake = lower glucose).
*   **Protein Intake:** Statistically significant positive correlation with glucose levels (higher protein intake = higher glucose).
    *   **Previous Highest Average Daily Protein Intake:** 147g/day.
    *   **Current Average Daily Protein Intake:** 108g/day.

### Dietary Strategy Based on Correlations

To reduce glucose levels:
1.  Maintain protein intake at current levels (around 108g/day).
2.  Reduce total fat intake.
3.  Increase carbohydrate intake (e.g., from oats, barley, corn) to follow the observed inverse correlation with glucose.

## Total Fat Intake and "Big Picture" Biomarkers

### "Big Picture" Biomarkers (23 Blood-Based)

Include indicators of insulin sensitivity, methylation, kidney and liver function, lipoproteins (HDL, LDL, VLDL, Lp(a)), immune cells, red blood cell metrics, inflammation (hs-CRP), and biological age scores.

### Correlation of Total Fat Intake with Biomarkers

*   **Total Significant Correlations:** 11 biomarkers with a p-value < 0.05.
*   **Biomarkers Moving in the "Wrong Direction" (Higher Fat Intake Associated):** 7 biomarkers. These are typically associated with aging and increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   Glucose
    *   Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)
    *   LDL
    *   Neutrophils
    *   Lower lymphocyte percentage
    *   Higher monocytes
    *   Higher platelets
*   **Biomarkers Moving in the "Right Direction" (Higher Fat Intake Associated):** 1 biomarker.
    *   Lower Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) (MCV is found in youth and lower MCV is associated with lower all-cause mortality risk).
*   **Debatable Biomarkers:** 3 biomarkers (AST, LDL, Red Blood Cells). The directionality of optimal levels based on literature is debated, but internal analysis suggests higher AST and lower Red Blood Cells might be beneficial in this context.

### Conclusion on Fat Intake

*   Higher average daily fat intake is significantly correlated with more "big picture" biomarkers moving in the wrong direction than the right direction.
*   This supports the decision to reduce total fat intake and increase carbohydrate intake.
