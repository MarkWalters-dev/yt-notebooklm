# 2022-04-24 How Much Oxalate Is Too Much n=1 Analysis

## Executive Summary

*   High dietary oxalate intake (median 277 mg/day) was associated with a 47% increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in individuals with low calcium intake (median 760 mg/day).
*   This association between high oxalate intake and CVD risk was not significant in individuals consuming medium to high calcium diets (>1180 mg/day).
*   In a personal analysis, significantly higher average daily oxalate intake (nearly 1600 mg/day) correlated with unfavorable trends in several "big picture" biomarkers (e.g., higher blood urea nitrogen, LDL, VLDL; lower lymphocytes) typically seen with aging.
*   After accounting for calcium intake (oxalate to calcium ratio), the significant correlations between oxalate and the previously identified unfavorable biomarkers disappeared.
*   However, the oxalate to calcium ratio showed new significant correlations with biomarkers associated with aging and increased all-cause mortality risk (higher uric acid, higher alkaline phosphatase, higher red blood cell distribution width).

## Previous Study Findings on Oxalate and CVD

*   **High Oxalate Intake (Tertile 3):** Median intake of 277 mg/day was associated with a 47% increased risk for CVD-related events (confidence interval 1.02-2.12). This was compared to lower oxalate intakes (Tertile 1: median 120 mg/day).
*   **Calcium Intake Interaction:**
    *   **Low Calcium Diet (Median 760 mg/day):** Significant increased CVD event risk was observed for tertiles 2 and 3 of oxalate intake.
    *   **Medium to High Calcium Diet (>1180 mg/day):** Oxalate intake was not associated with CVD event risk, as confidence intervals overlapped with 1, indicating no statistical significance.

## Personal Oxalate Intake and Health Biomarkers (n=1 Analysis)

The speaker tracked their daily food intake for seven years (April 2015 - April 2022) to estimate daily oxalate intake and correlated this with blood test biomarkers.

*   **Average Daily Oxalate Intake:** Nearly 1600 mg/day over seven years.
    *   This is 4-8 times higher than the tertile 3 intake (277 mg/day) in the previous study.
*   **"Big Picture" Biomarkers Considered:** Glucose, homocysteine, kidney function markers, liver function markers, lipoproteins, immune cells, red blood cell markers, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and biological age scores (PhenoAge, aging.ai).
*   **Correlations with Higher Oxalate Intake (Prior to Calcium Adjustment):**
    *   **Negative Correlations (Wrong Direction for Health/Aging):**
        *   Significantly correlated with higher Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) - BUN increases with aging.
        *   Significantly correlated with higher LDL - LDL increases with aging.
        *   Significantly correlated with higher VLDL - VLDL increases with aging.
        *   Significantly correlated with lower Lymphocytes - Lymphocytes decline with aging.
        *   Significantly correlated with lower Lymphocyte Percentage - Lymphocyte percentage declines with aging.
        *   *Potentially* correlated with higher Neutrophils (p=0.06, close to significance).
    *   **Positive Correlation (Right Direction for Health/Aging):**
        *   Significantly correlated with higher Platelets - Platelets decline with aging.
*   **Net Score (Without Calcium Adjustment):** 5 biomarkers in the wrong direction, 1 in the right direction. Net score of -4. This suggests reducing oxalate intake might be beneficial.

## Impact of Calcium Intake on Oxalate Correlations

The analysis was repeated using the oxalate to calcium ratio to account for dietary calcium intake.

*   **Effect on Previous Correlations:** After accounting for calcium intake (oxalate/calcium ratio), the significant correlations for BUN, LDL, VLDL, lymphocyte count, and lymphocyte percentage were no longer statistically significant.
*   **New Significant Correlations with Oxalate/Calcium Ratio:**
    *   **Positive Correlation (Wrong Direction for Health/Aging):**
        *   Significantly correlated with higher Uric Acid - Uric acid levels increase with aging.
        *   Significantly correlated with higher Alkaline Phosphatase - Higher levels are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
        *   Significantly correlated with higher Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) - RDW increases with aging.
*   **Net Score (With Calcium Adjustment):** 3 biomarkers in the wrong direction, 1 in the right direction. Net score of -2. This indicates that even after accounting for calcium, dietary oxalate is still associated with more biomarkers moving in an unfavorable direction.

## Future Dietary Adjustments

*   The speaker plans to replace spinach (a major source of their oxalate intake) with low-oxalate greens like collard greens.
