# 2020-06-03 Biological Age Testing - 15 Years Younger Than My Chronological Age

## Executive Summary

*   **Phenotypic Age as a Biological Age Metric:** Levine's phenotypic age, calculated using nine clinical variables and chronological age, is a strong predictor of biological aging, showing high correlations (0.94-0.96) with chronological age in large datasets.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** An increase of one year in phenotypic age is associated with a 9% increase in the risk of death from all causes, a correlation observed across all age groups.
*   **Disease-Specific Mortality:** Phenotypic age is linked to increased risk of death from various diseases, including heart disease, cancer, and chronic lower respiratory disease, with cerebral vascular disease being an exception in one study.
*   **Optimizing Phenotypic Age:** Phenotypic age can be relatively inexpensively monitored and potentially optimized through lifestyle interventions such as diet and fitness, as demonstrated by personal data showing a significant reduction in biological age.
*   **Data-Driven Lifestyle Adjustments:** Rigorous tracking of diet, macro/micronutrients, and phytochemicals, combined with frequent blood testing, allows for the identification of personalized dietary changes that positively impact biomarkers.

## Phenotypic Age Calculator

Levine's phenotypic age is a biological age calculator that comprises the following ten variables:

*   Albumin
*   Creatinine
*   Serum glucose
*   C-reactive protein
*   Percentage of lymphocytes of total white blood cells
*   Average red cell volume
*   Red cell distribution width
*   Alkaline phosphatase
*   White blood cell count
*   Chronological age

### Validation of Phenotypic Age

*   **NHANES Dataset:** The initial data was derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset, comprising approximately 10,000 individuals. In this dataset, phenotypic age showed a strong correlation of 0.94 with chronological age.
*   **NHANES IV Dataset:** Findings were replicated using the NHANES IV dataset, including 11,000 participants. Phenotypic age demonstrated an even stronger correlation with chronological age, with a coefficient of 0.96.
*   **Comparison to Epigenetic Clocks:** The correlation of phenotypic age (0.96) is comparable to the initial epigenetic clock (Corvast), which had a correlation of 0.97 with chronological age.

## Association with Mortality Risk

The combination of the ten variables used in phenotypic age calculation is associated with the risk of death from all causes (all-cause mortality risk).

*   **All-Cause Mortality:** For every one-year increase in phenotypic age, the risk of all-cause mortality increases by 9%. This significant association was observed consistently across young adults, middle-aged adults, and older adults.
*   **Disease-Specific Mortality:** For every one-year increase in phenotypic age, the risk of death from the following diseases also increased:
    *   Heart disease
    *   Cancer
    *   Chronic lower respiratory disease
    *   Diabetes
    *   Influenza or pneumonia
    *   Nephritis
*   **Exception:** Phenotypic age was not associated with an increased risk of death from cerebral vascular disease in the NHANES IV study.

## Optimizing Biological Age

Optimizing biological age involves monitoring and making lifestyle adjustments.

### Monitoring Phenotypic Age

*   **Components:** Phenotypic age can be monitored by obtaining a standard chemistry panel (commonly performed at yearly physicals), a complete blood count (CBC, including white blood cells, red blood cells, hemoglobin, and differentials), and a C-reactive protein (CRP) test.
*   **Cost:** In the US, the cost for these tests is estimated to be between $75 and $80, making it relatively inexpensive compared to other biological age measures like epigenetic clocks.
*   **Calculation:** Individuals with access to their blood test data can calculate their phenotypic age using available online phenotypic age calculators.

### Impact of Lifestyle Factors on Phenotypic Age

The speaker's personal data illustrates the potential for optimizing biological age through lifestyle changes.

*   **Personal Data:** The speaker's chronological age is 47. After blood testing and data analysis, their phenotypic age was calculated to be 31.61, indicating they are at least 15 years younger than their chronological age.
*   **Improvement Over Time:** Initial phenotypic age measurements from two years prior were higher (around 35). Through diet changes, improved fitness, and body composition optimization, the biological age has been reduced.

### Dietary Approach for Optimization

A data-driven approach to diet is crucial for impacting biomarkers.

*   **Comprehensive Tracking:**
    *   Weighing all food with a food scale.
    *   Tracking all food intake data using free online software.
    *   Logging macro- and micronutrients (protein, carbs, fat, vitamins, minerals).
    *   Tracking individual food consumption to account for phytochemicals.
*   **Correlation Analysis:**
    *   Conducting blood tests 4-6 times per year.
    *   Correlating average dietary intake during the period of blood testing with blood test results to identify meaningful correlations between diet and biomarkers.
*   **Iterative Adjustments:**
    *   Making informed dietary changes based on identified correlations.
    *   Continuously tweaking the diet to observe its effects and drive biomarkers in a desired direction.
*   **Precision:** This approach is more precise than relying solely on broad epidemiological studies, especially when less frequent blood testing is performed.
