# 2023-09-06 I've Got A Big Problem In My Oral Microbiome Serratia marcescens But Also A Plan To Reduce It

## Executive Summary

*   *Serratia marcescens* is a bacterium found in the oral microbiome that has been linked to various negative health outcomes, including pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis.
*   Analysis of oral microbiome tests revealed an exceptionally high abundance of *Serratia marcescens* (up to 96%) in the speaker's samples, far exceeding the typical levels found in other users.
*   In vitro studies show that 5% xylitol can inhibit *Serratia marcescens* growth, but a one-month in vivo trial using a 5% xylitol mouthwash did not reduce its abundance.
*   *Streptococcus mitis* has demonstrated the ability to inhibit *Serratia marcescens* growth through hydrogen peroxide generation, and inverse correlation was observed between their abundances in the speaker's data.
*   Dietary analysis revealed significant correlations between certain foods and the abundance of *Serratia marcescens* and inversely correlated bacteria, suggesting potential dietary interventions.

## Serratia marcescens: A Problematic Oral Bacterium

*   *Serratia marcescens* is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes:
    *   Pneumonia
    *   Sepsis
    *   Meningitis
    *   And other conditions.

## Oral Microbiome Test Data

### Test 1 (June 2022): Initial Profile

*   Microbial species and relative abundance (%) were analyzed.
*   Alzheimer's disease-related bacteria (e.g., *P. Gingivalis*, *F. Nucleatum*, *Tannerella forsythia*) were noted to be present at low levels.
*   *Rothia species* were at ~21% abundance.
*   *Streptococcus mitis* was at ~12% abundance.
*   **Note:** This test was initially considered to have no major outliers, but a subsequent analysis revealed a significant issue with *Serratia marcescens*.

### Subsequent Tests: High Serratia marcescens Abundance

*   **Test 1 (Revised):** Initially thought to be contaminated, *Serratia marcescens* was at an extreme outlier level of 88% of all bacteria.
*   **Test 3:** *Serratia marcescens* decreased to 41% of all bacteria.
*   **Test 4:** *Serratia marcescens* was at 0%.
*   **Tests 5 & 6:** *Serratia marcescens* increased to 95% of all bacteria.
*   **Test 7 (July 2023):** *Serratia marcescens* reached its highest level to date at 96% of all bacteria.

### Bristle User Data Comparison

*   Approximately 90% of Bristle users have zero *Serratia marcescens*.
*   7-9% of users have less than 1% relative abundance.
*   The speaker falls into the 1-3% of users who have above 1% *Serratia marcescens*, with three tests showing greater than 88% abundance. This indicates the high levels are likely not a general contamination issue for the testing service.

## Investigating Interventions for Serratia marcescens Reduction

### Xylitol Intervention

*   **In Vitro Study:** 5% xylitol was shown to inhibit *Serratia marcescens* growth by approximately 80% in cell culture, significantly reducing biofilm formation.
*   **Homemade Mouthwash Protocol:**
    *   Ingredients: 5 grams of xylitol per 100 ml of water (resulting in a 5% concentration).
    *   Preparation: A 400 ml solution was made using 20 grams of xylitol.
    *   Usage: Used 3-5 times per day for one month.
*   **Results:** The 5% xylitol mouthwash did not reduce *Serratia marcescens* levels; in fact, levels reached 96% during this period.

### Hydrogen Peroxide and Streptococcus Mitis

*   **Research Finding:** A 40-year-old study indicated that *Streptococcus mitis* can antagonize *Serratia marcescens* growth through hydrogen peroxide generation.
*   **Observation in Speaker's Data:**
    *   When *Serratia marcescens* was at 88% or higher (four tests), *Streptococcus mitis* was very low (<0.4%).
    *   When *Serratia marcescens* was at 0% (two tests), *Streptococcus mitis* levels were at their highest (~11-12%).
    *   When *Serratia marcescens* was at 41%, *Streptococcus mitis* was at an intermediate level.
*   **Hypothesis:** Increasing *Streptococcus mitis* may help reduce *Serratia marcescens*. However, *Streptococcus mitis* is not commercially available as a probiotic.

## Exploring Synergistic and Dietary Approaches

### Bacteria Inversely Associated with Serratia marcescens

*   A correlation analysis was performed to identify oral bacteria that are inversely associated with *Serratia marcescens* (higher levels of these bacteria correspond to lower *Serratia marcescens*).
*   The focus was on the most abundant bacteria showing significant inverse correlation (p < 0.05).
*   Seven other species, along with *Serratia marcescens*, collectively represented about 24% of the total bacteria in high-abundance instances.
*   The speaker aims for a "team effort" by increasing the levels of these inversely correlated bacteria.

### Dietary Correlations

*   Dietary intake (macros, micros, and individual foods) was tracked and averaged over 30 days corresponding to each oral microbiome test to investigate correlations.

#### Correlations with Serratia marcescens:

*   **Protein Intake:** A higher protein intake was significantly correlated with higher *Serratia marcescens*. The speaker plans to target the lower end of their protein intake range (around 96g/day).
*   **Low Fat Yogurt:** A significant inverse correlation was observed. Higher low fat yogurt intake (up to 150g/day) was correlated with lower *Serratia marcescens*.

#### Correlations with Inversely Correlated Bacteria:

*   **Mushrooms:** Showed significant inverse correlations with six of the eight inversely correlated bacteria. Higher mushroom intake was correlated with lower levels of these bacteria. The speaker plans to reduce mushroom intake.
*   **Low Fat Yogurt:** Positively correlated with four of the eight inversely associated bacteria, suggesting increasing intake.
*   **Onions:** Higher onion intake was significantly correlated with higher *Serratia marcescens*. The speaker plans to reduce onion intake to zero.
*   **Protein:** Significantly correlated with three of the eight inversely correlated bacteria, in addition to its correlation with *Serratia marcescens*. The goal is to target ~96g/day.
*   **Other Nutrients/Foods (Replication in >= 2 Comparisons):** Cinnamon, pistachios, vitamin E, vitamin B2, and beta-cryptoxanthin will be followed based on their correlations. For example, pistachios are positively correlated with two bacteria, suggesting an increase in intake.

## Future Plan

*   The speaker will follow these identified dietary correlations for the next oral microbiome test.
*   The expectation is that by adhering to as many correlations as possible, an improvement in *Serratia marcescens* levels may be observed.
*   If the intervention is unsuccessful, correlations will be recalculated, and the plan will be adjusted.
