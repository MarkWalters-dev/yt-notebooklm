# 2026-01-11 TMAO Is Bad For Health But Can Be Reduced 21-Test Analysis

## Executive Summary

*   Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is linked to negative health outcomes, including kidney and brain issues, high blood pressure, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and atherosclerosis.
*   TMAO is produced from dietary precursors (choline, carnitine, betaine) and fish, which are converted by gut bacteria to trimethylamine (TMA), then oxidized in the liver to TMAO.
*   Gut lumen pH plays a crucial role; an alkaline pH promotes TMA-producing bacteria. Fecal pH increases with age, correlating with higher TMAO.
*   Plasma TMAO levels below 2 micromolar are associated with lower all-cause mortality risk, while levels above 4 micromolar are associated with increased risk.
*   Dietary factors such as garlic intake show a negative correlation with TMAO levels, suggesting a potential intervention strategy for reduction.

## TMAO and Health Impacts

TMAO negatively impacts:
*   Kidneys
*   Brain
*   Blood pressure
*   Heart failure
*   Peripheral vascular disease
*   Atherosclerosis

## TMAO and Precursor Production Pathway

Dietary precursors (betaine, choline, ergothionine) and TMAO are found in fish. Gut bacteria in the intestine convert these precursors into TMA.
Intestine: Dietary Precursors (Betaine, Choline, Ergothionine) + Gut Bacterial Enzymes -> TMA (Trimethylamine)

TMA travels to the liver and is oxidized into TMAO.
Blood: TMA -> Liver (Oxidation) -> TMAO (Trimethylamine N-oxide)

## Food Sources of TMAO and Precursors

### TMAO and TMA in Fish
Highest concentrations are found in:
*   Cod
*   Lobster
*   Orange roughy

Farm-raised salmon has a very low content of TMAO and TMA. Wild-caught salmon has more TMA and TMAO relative to farm-raised.

### TMAO Precursor Foods
Carnitine, choline, and betaine are found in:
*   Beef
*   Eggs
*   Shrimp

Betaine is also found in:
*   Beets

Ergothionine is found in high abundance in:
*   Mushrooms

These foods have been "unfairly villainized" for their potential role in TMAO formation. Vegans consuming mushrooms and beets could also potentially convert these into TMA and TMAO.

## Gut Bacteria and TMA Production: The Role of pH

A main factor controlling TMAO production is the pH in the gut lumen.

*   **Normal Condition:** Gut lumen is acidic.
*   **Alkaline Gut Lumen pH:**
    *   Leads to the growth of pathogenic bacteria.
    *   These bacteria produce TMA.
    *   TMA is oxidized to TMAO in the liver.
    *   These bacteria also produce other harmful metabolites like indoxyl sulfate (IS) and para-cresol sulfate (PCS).
    *   These metabolites can diffuse between epithelial cells, disrupting tight junctions and entering the bloodstream.

### Fecal pH and Aging
Fecal pH increases during aging, contributing to TMA production.
*   Centenarians have significantly higher fecal pH (average 8) compared to young subjects (average 7).
*   A pH difference of 1 unit represents a 10-fold difference on the logarithmic scale, meaning centenarian fecal pH is 10 times less acidic.

### Factors Impacting Lumen pH
A major factor is fecal levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which include acetate, propionate, and butyrate.
*   High-fiber diet promotes SCFA production.
*   Exercise training promotes SCFA production.

**Implications:**
*   Low-fiber diet + lots of meat can lead to high TMAO.
*   Lack of exercise training can lead to low SCFA levels and correspondingly high TMAO.

Kidney function is also involved in removing TMAO, but gut lumen acidification is a major factor in limiting TMA-producing bacteria.

## Optimal TMAO Levels and Age-Related Changes

### TMAO and All-Cause Mortality Risk
A meta-analysis of 10 studies plotting relative risk of death against plasma TMAO levels indicated:
*   **TMAO < 2 micromolar:** Significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality risk (hazard ratio below 1).
*   **TMAO > 4 micromolar:** Significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.

### TMAO Levels During Aging
Plasma TMAO levels increase with age:
*   **Young Subjects (20-27 years):** Average TMAO around 2 micromolar.
*   **Middle-aged to Older Subjects (50-79 years):** TMAO levels approximately triple compared to young subjects.

**Optimal Target:**
*   **Less than 2 micromolar.**
*   Avoid age-related increases.

## Personal TMAO Data and Tracking

The speaker has been tracking TMAO levels using an at-home metabolomics kit for three years (2023-2025) with 21 tests.

| Year | Number of Tests | Average TMAO (micromolar) |
| :--- | :-------------- | :------------------------ |
| 2023 | 5               | 7.3                       |
| 2024 | 9               | 6.0                       |
| 2025 | 7 (first)       | 4.6                       |

**Analysis of Personal Data:**
*   The average TMAO levels over the past three years have not met the "less than 2 micromolar" target.
*   However, there have been instances of achieving TMAO levels below 2 micromolar in at least two tests.
*   Two recent tests showed levels closer to 4 micromolar, indicating progress.

## Strategies for Reducing TMAO: Dietary Correlations

Dietary intake has been weighed and tracked using a food scale since 2015 to analyze correlations with TMAO levels.

### Significant Negative Correlations with TMAO (Foods associated with lower TMAO)
*   Garlic
*   Zinc
*   Avocado
*   Nutmeg
*   Celery
*   Non-fat yogurt
*   Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs)
*   Olives
*   Black pepper

### Significant Positive Correlations with TMAO (Foods associated with higher TMAO)
*   Banana
*   Dates
*   Salt

## Intervention: Garlic Intake

Based on the negative correlation, the speaker focused on increasing garlic intake for test #22.

*   **Extrapolation from correlation plot:** To reach the 2 micromolar target, an estimated garlic intake of around 3.5 grams per day would be needed.
*   **Test #22 Intervention:** Average garlic intake over the 60 days prior to the test was 2.9 grams per day.
*   **Pre-test increase:** For the seven days before testing, average garlic intake was 5.7 grams per day.

The results of test #22 (December 26th, 2025) will reveal whether these interventions effectively lowered TMAO levels.

## Future Directions and Optimization

*   Continue tracking TMAO levels.
*   Follow top correlations with diet to keep TMAO as low as possible and avoid age-related increases.
*   Exploring personalized recipes for TMAO reduction based on individual data.
