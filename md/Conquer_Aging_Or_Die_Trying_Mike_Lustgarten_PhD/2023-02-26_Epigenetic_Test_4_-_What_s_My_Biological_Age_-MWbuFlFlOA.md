# 2023-02-26 Epigenetic Test 4 - What s My Biological Age

## Executive Summary

*   Hannum epigenetic age consistently shows 10-12 years younger than chronological age, indicating positive immune system aging.
*   Dunedin PACE indicates a slower biological aging rate, averaging 0.82 years of epigenetic aging per chronological year.
*   Horvath epigenetic age consistently shows 4-7 years older than chronological age, reflecting older cell-intrinsic aging.
*   Future efforts will focus on identifying interventions, including NMN supplementation, to reduce Horvath epigenetic age, with further blood analysis scheduled for March 6.

The data discussed encompasses three epigenetic tests: Hannum, Dunedin PACE, and Horvath, which were generated using True Diagnostic.

## Hannum Epigenetic Age (EEAA)

Hannum's test, also known as Extrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration (EEAA), serves as a marker of immune system aging.

*   **Most recent test (January 2023):** 38.79 years, which is 11 years younger than chronological age.
*   **Comparison with previous tests:**
    *   Tests 1 & 2: 12 years younger.
    *   Test 3: 10 years younger (the least favorable data to date).
*   **Four-test average:** 38.3 years, indicating an age 10-12 years younger than chronological age. This trend is considered positive.

## Dunedin PACE

Dunedin PACE stands for "pace of aging calculated from the epigenome," derived from the Dunedin study in New Zealand. This metric quantifies the rate of epigenetic aging.

*   **Reference values:** The slowest epigenetic aging rate observed is 0.6 (meaning 0.6 years of epigenetic aging per 1 chronological year), while the fastest is 1.4 (1.4 years of epigenetic aging per 1 chronological year).
*   **Most recent test (January 2023):** 0.78, indicating that for every one year of chronological age, epigenetic age increases by only 0.78 years. This shows room for improvement towards the lowest observed rate of 0.6.
*   **Comparison with previous tests:**
    *   Tests 1 & 2: 0.74 (the most favorable data).
    *   Test 3: 0.89 (the least favorable data, indicating a faster aging rate relative to tests 1, 2, and 4).
*   **Four-test average:** 0.82 years of epigenetic aging per chronological year.

## Epigenetic Leaderboard (Dunedin PACE)

True Diagnostic maintains an epigenetic leaderboard ranking individuals based on their Dunedin PACE, including over 1750 people, with an update expected on March 1.

The leaderboard typically highlights individuals with the best improvement in Dunedin PACE from a baseline. However, sorting by the average PACE value over multiple tests provides a more accurate representation of the true aging rate.

*   **Current top performer (average over three tests):** Jamarian Richard, with a Dunedin PACE value of 0.696, indicating an aging rate of approximately 0.7 years per chronological year.
*   **Comparison of personal data:** A personal four-test average of 0.82 could potentially place the individual around fifth place on the updated leaderboard (expected March 1), based on the slowest Dunedin PACE values. Lower Dunedin PACE numbers signify a slower epigenetic aging rate, while higher numbers indicate a faster rate.

## Horvath Epigenetic Age (IEAA)

Horvath's test, or Intrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration (IEAA), is a marker of cell-intrinsic aging.

*   **Most recent test (January 2023):** 54.81 years, which is 5 years older than chronological age, indicating an older biological age.
*   **Comparison with previous tests:** A consistent trend of older biological age is observed across all Horvath data.
    *   Test 1: 6 years older than chronological age.
    *   Test 2: 4 years older than chronological age.
    *   Test 3: 7 years older than chronological age (the least favorable data).
*   **Four-test average:** 54.9 years, indicating an age 4-7 years older than chronological age.

## Future Plans

Efforts will focus on identifying strategies to reduce Horvath's epigenetic age.

*   **Methodology:**
    *   Track diet and supplement intake.
    *   After the next test (providing a total of five data points), analyze for correlations between lifestyle factors and epigenetic age values to identify potential improvements.
*   **Current Intervention:**
    *   Daily supplementation with 300 mg of NMN.
    *   Goal: Increase NAD levels.
    *   Process: NMN (supplementation) -> Increased NAD
*   **Upcoming Testing (March 6):**
    *   Blood analysis for epigenetic age.
    *   A full blood panel to assess other health markers.
