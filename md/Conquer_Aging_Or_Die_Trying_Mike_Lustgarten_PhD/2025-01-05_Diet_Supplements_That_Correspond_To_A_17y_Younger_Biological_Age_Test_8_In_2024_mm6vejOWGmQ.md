# 2025-01-05 Diet Supplements That Correspond To A 17y Younger Biological Age Test 8 In 2024

### Executive Summary

*   Biological age, as calculated by Dr. Morgan Levine's PhenoAge algorithm, was determined to be 17 years younger than chronological age for blood test number 8 in 2024.
*   Targeted dietary interventions influenced key biomarkers: reducing flaxseed intake decreased Lipoprotein(a) by 10% (from 90 nM to 80 nM), increasing orange intake correlated with a slightly higher DHEA sulfate level (128 vs. average 125), and doubling chickpea intake correlated with a reduction in creatinine (0.95 to 0.87 mg/dL).
*   Nicotinic acid supplementation aimed to maintain NAD levels between 20-30 micromolar, with the current test showing 25.5 µM. Variability between tests (e.g., 32 µM previously with lower niacin intake) suggests additional factors influencing NAD levels beyond direct niacin intake.
*   Average daily caloric intake was 2119 kcal. This intake level is maintained to optimize a broad spectrum of biomarkers while preventing excessively low lymphocyte counts previously observed at lower caloric intakes.
*   The overall dietary strategy involved a 98.5% "clean" diet, with controlled cheat meals immediately following blood tests. This approach contributes 1.5% of total calories from "junk" food, aiming for satiety and sustainability without impacting long-term health goals.

## Biological Age Assessment

For blood test number eight in 2024, using Dr. Morgan Levine's biological age calculator PhenoAge, biological age was found to be seventeen years younger than chronological age.

## Prescription Medications

A daily dose of 137.5 micrograms of Levothyroxine is taken for hypothyroidism, diagnosed in the twenties.

## Supplements

The 53-day period for this test ran from October 25 to December 16.

*   **Vitamin D:** Supplemented with 2000 IU per day for 52 out of 53 days.
*   **Nicotinic Acid:**
    *   Supplemented with 35 to 85 milligrams of nicotinic acid per day to maintain NAD levels in the 20 to 30 micromolar range, as baseline NAD can be very low (20 micromolar or less) without precursors.
    *   **Preparation Method:**
        *   Nicotinic acid powder is suspended in water.
        *   Aliquots are taken daily, adjusted based on dietary niacin intake (aiming for approximately 100 mg total niacin per day).
    *   **NAD Levels:**
        *   On December 17 (the day of the test), NAD levels were 25.5 micromolar, with an average daily niacin intake of 103 milligrams over the 53-day period.
        *   For test number seven, average niacin intake (including nicotinic acid) was 86 milligrams, but NAD levels were higher at 32 micromolar.
    *   **Implications:** This suggests test-to-test variability (around 5 micromolar) or the involvement of other factors that influence NAD levels beyond total niacin intake. Correlations between NAD and diet are being analyzed using over 20 data points to identify these additional factors.

## Diet Composition

The following represents the average daily dietary intake for the 53-day period preceding test number eight.

*   **Coffee:** 0.4 ounces (average, based on one 20-ounce homemade coffee over the 53 days).
*   **Green Tea:** 19.2 ounces per day (typically 20 ounces).
    *   An experiment involved removing green tea (and caffeine) for two of the 53 days to assess impact on nocturnal awakenings, sleep duration, or slow-wave sleep percentage. No significant impact was observed, and intake has since returned to 20 ounces daily.

## Targeted Dietary Experiments

Three primary experiments were conducted to optimize specific biomarkers. For each test, small dietary adjustments are made to optimize weak spots without overhauling the entire diet.

1.  **Reduction in Flaxseed Intake to Lower Lipoprotein(a):**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Gamma tocopherol (a vitamin E isoform found in flaxseeds) positively correlated with Lipoprotein(a) in personal data. Higher Lipoprotein(a) is associated with increased atherogenicity and a faster epigenetic speed of aging (DunedinPACE).
    *   **Methodology:**
        *   Flaxseed intake was reduced from 16 grams per day (prior to Test 7) to an average of 12 grams per day for the Test 8 period.
        *   For the two weeks immediately preceding Test 8, flaxseed intake was further reduced to 7 grams per day.
    *   **Results:** Lipoprotein(a) decreased from 90 nanomolar (Test 7) to 80 nanomolar (Test 8). This reduction occurred despite a concurrent decrease in cacao bean intake (previously inversely correlated with Lipoprotein(a)) from 12 grams to 5 grams per day. The correlation between flaxseeds/gamma tocopherol and Lipoprotein(a) appears to have strengthened.

2.  **Increase in Orange Intake to Support DHEA Sulfate Levels:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Oranges showed a significant positive correlation with DHEA sulfate levels in personal data. DHEA sulfate levels typically decline with aging, but have been relatively stable over 18 previous tests.
    *   **Methodology:** Orange intake was increased from 35 grams per day (prior to Test 7) to 58 grams per day for the Test 8 period.
    *   **Results:** DHEA sulfate levels were 128, slightly above the recent 18-test average of 125, suggesting a positive impact in resisting age-related decline. (Historical DHEA sulfate levels of approximately 300 were observed 20 years prior, though this was confounded by DHEA supplementation at the time).

3.  **Increase in Chickpea Intake to Improve Creatinine (Kidney Function):**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Chickpeas correlated with lower creatinine levels in personal data, indicating potentially better kidney function. (Note: For individuals under 65, creatinine is considered a valid biomarker for kidney function; for those over 65, Cystatin C may be more accurate due to creatinine's proportionality to muscle mass).
    *   **Methodology:** Chickpea intake (dry weight) was doubled from 9 grams per day (prior to Test 7) to 19 grams per day.
    *   **Results:** Creatinine decreased from the multi-test average since 2015 of 0.95 milligrams per deciliter to 0.87 milligrams per deciliter, a small but potentially significant improvement indicative of better kidney function.

## Dietary Approach and Cheat Meals

The dietary strategy incorporates "cheat meals" immediately following blood tests. This typically spans one to two days, where macro and micronutrient targets are not strictly adhered to. This approach has historically prevented prolonged cravings and subsequent binges often associated with indefinitely strict diets.

*   **Post-Test 7 Cheat Meals:** Included homemade chocolate-peanut butter (melted chocolate, peanut butter, sugar) and homemade ice cream (heavy cream, dulce de leche—boiled sweetened condensed milk, and raspberry jam).
*   **Junk Calorie Contribution:**
    *   Chocolate chips: $6.87
    *   Sugar: $3.93
    *   Sweetened condensed milk: $3.14
    *   Raspberry jam: $3.36
    *   Total junk calories equated to $17.30, representing 1.5% of total calories consumed during the 53-day period (meaning the diet was 98.5% clean).

## Macronutrient Breakdown

*   **Average Daily Caloric Intake:** 2119 kcal. This is close to the lowest intake since 2015 (2076 kcal). While lower caloric intake often improves many biomarkers, the 2076 kcal range was associated with lower lymphocyte levels (1300-1400/µL), moving towards an aged state. The current target of around 2100 kcal aims to keep lymphocytes youthful (closer to 1900/µL) while optimizing other biomarkers.
*   **Protein:** 96 grams per day, accounting for 18% of total calories.
*   **Fat:** 91 grams per day, accounting for 39% of total calories. (Includes monounsaturated, omega-3, omega-6, and saturated fat breakdown).
*   **Carbohydrates:**
    *   Total Carbs: 268 grams per day.
    *   Fiber: 76.5 grams per day.
    *   Net Carbs (Total Carbs - Fiber): 193 grams per day, accounting for 36% of total calories.
    *   **Fiber to Fat Conversion:** Approximately 20% of total fiber is soluble fiber, which is fermented by gut bacteria into short-chain fatty acids (acetate, propionate, butyrate). This process contributes an estimated 148 calories, or 7% of the total diet, to the "fat" category.
    *   **Total Fructose Intake:** 62 grams per day (calculated as half of sucrose content plus direct fructose). This is towards the lower end of the personal range, as higher fructose intake has been correlated with negative biomarker changes.
*   **Revised Net Macronutrient Composition (accounting for fiber conversion):**
    *   Total Fat: 46%
    *   Net Carbs: 36%
    *   Total Protein: 18%

## Micronutrient and Mineral Intake

Many micronutrient intakes are purposefully much higher than the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), based on personal correlations with biomarker optimization. For example, Vitamin K intake is approximately 24 times the adequate intake, as it has shown significant correlations with positive biomarker changes.

It is recommended that individuals new to biomarker optimization first ensure full RDA coverage for all micronutrients before tracking personal correlations to optimize intake levels for specific biomarkers.
