# 2024-04-07 Resting Heart Rate Heart Rate Variability - What's Optimal 2,061 Days of Data

## Executive Summary

*   Resting heart rate (RHR) generally increases with age up to approximately 50 years, after which it tends to decline.
*   Heart rate variability (HRV) consistently declines with age across all measured time points.
*   A low RHR is indicative of youth when paired with high HRV, and indicative of older age when paired with low HRV.
*   Personal tracking over 2,061 days shows a significant decrease in average yearly RHR from 51 to 42.1 bpm and a significant increase in average yearly HRV from 47 to 67.8 ms.
*   The observed improvements in RHR and HRV suggest that these biomarkers can be significantly optimized beyond typical age-related changes.

## Biomarker Integration

Resting heart rate and heart rate variability, while measured at the heart, are influenced by:
*   **Autonomic Nervous System Balance:** Specifically, the interplay between sympathetic and parasympathetic (vagus) nerves.
*   **Adrenal Gland Activation:** Leading to the production of norepinephrine and epinephrine, which affect RHR and HRV.
Therefore, these two metrics serve as an integration of the heart, nervous system, and adrenal gland function.

## Resting Heart Rate and Aging

### WHOOP Data (20-50 years)
*   Average resting heart rate plotted against age for men and women.
*   RHR increases for both sexes up to approximately 50 years.
*   An age-related decline in RHR for women begins to be observed after 45 years.

### Fitbit Data (Published Study, 20-85 years)
*   Study of over 90,000 people.
*   Average resting heart rate versus age.
*   Confirms an age-related increase in RHR up to approximately 50 years for both women and men.
*   After 50 years, an age-related decline in RHR is observed.
*   **Note:** Relatively low RHR can be found in both youth and older ages, necessitating additional context.

## Heart Rate Variability and Aging

### Large Scale Study (8.2 million people)
*   Heart rate variability (Root Mean Squared of Successive Differences - RMSSD) plotted against age (20-60 years).
*   Two measurement times are shown: 6 AM (solid line) and 6 PM (dashed line).
*   Regardless of measurement time, a consistent age-related decline in HRV is observed.
*   HRV continues to decline beyond 60 years.

## Interpreting Low Resting Heart Rate

*   A low resting heart rate in conjunction with **high heart rate variability** is indicative of **youth**.
*   A low resting heart rate in combination with **low heart rate variability** is indicative of **older age**.

## Personal Data Analysis (2,061 Days)

### Average Yearly Resting Heart Rate
*   Data tracked from August 2018 to March 2024.
*   Each data point represents a single day.

*   **2018:** ~51 bpm
*   **2019:** ~49 bpm
*   **2020:** ~48 bpm
*   **2021:** ~47 bpm
*   **2022:** ~45 bpm
*   **2023:** ~43 bpm
*   **2024 (Q1 thus far):** ~42.1 bpm

**Statistical Analysis (Two Sample T-Test):**
*   **Q1 2024 vs. Full Year 2023:** Significant reduction in RHR in 2024 (p=0.001).
*   **Q1 2024 vs. 2018:** Q1 2024 RHR is significantly lower than 2018 (p < 0.001).

**Conclusion:** Consistent reduction in resting heart rate from 51 bpm to 42.1 bpm since 2018. The data suggests avoidance of the typical age-related increase and potential for optimization.

### Average Yearly Heart Rate Variability (RMSSD)
*   Data tracked over the same 2,061-day period.

*   **2018:** ~47 ms
*   **2019:** ~56 ms
*   **2020:** ~58 ms
*   **2021:** ~52 ms (Regression)
*   **2022:** ~59 ms
*   **2023:** ~66 ms
*   **2024 (Q1 thus far):** ~67.8 ms

**Statistical Analysis (Two Sample T-Test):**
*   **Q1 2024 vs. 2023:** Q1 2024 HRV is significantly higher than 2023 (p=0.001).
*   **Q1 2024 vs. 2018:** Q1 2024 HRV is significantly higher than 2018 (p = 1 x 10<sup>-47</sup>).

**Conclusion:** Significant increase in heart rate variability from 47 ms to an average of 67.8 ms per day since 2018, representing a 43% improvement. This demonstrates that HRV can be significantly improved beyond typical age-related declines.

## Optimal State Interpretation

*   **Youth/Optimal State:** High heart rate variability in conjunction with a low resting heart rate.
*   **Chronological Age (Reference):** Lower heart rate variability (~35 ms) and a higher resting heart rate (~57 bpm) would be expected based on population data.

The personal data aligns with an optimal state, characterized by both a low resting heart rate and high heart rate variability, significantly differing from expected age-related norms.
