# 2025-02-19 19y Younger Biological Age Blood Test 1 In 2025

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age, calculated using Dr. Morgan Levine's PhenoAge clock, is 32.9 years, which is 19.1 years younger than chronological age. This represents the second-best result out of 38 tests over the past seven years.
*   Historical PhenoAge data (2018-2025) indicates a successful resistance to age-related biological age increases, with the current 32.9 years being significantly lower than the chronologically predicted 39.2 years for 2025.
*   Key biomarkers like high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) at <0.3 mg/L, youthful liver function (Albumin 4.9 g/dL, optimal Alkaline Phosphatase, AST, ALT), low Fibrinogen (258 mg/dL), and a low Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) at 11.8% are positive indicators of health and longevity.
*   Areas identified for optimization include elevated Homocysteine (9.8 µmol/L), highest recorded HbA1c (5.4%), concerning trends in kidney function markers (Blood Urea Nitrogen 11 mg/dL, Cystatin C 0.79 mg/L), a low Free T3:Free T4 ratio (0.18), and consistently low Lymphocytes (<1550/µL).
*   Future interventions include ongoing efforts to reduce Homocysteine, increasing monitoring frequency for HbA1c and Cystatin C, and discussing a prescription switch from Levothyroxine (T4) to Triiodothyronine (T3) with healthcare providers to improve thyroid hormone balance.

## PhenoAge Biological Age Calculation

The biological age was calculated using Dr. Morgan Levine's PhenoAge clock, which correlates with chronological age and is associated with all-cause mortality risk.

The current biological age is 32.9 years, which is 19.1 years younger than chronological age. This is the second-best test result over 38 tests in the past seven years, approaching the theoretical maximum reduction of approximately 20 years.

### PhenoAge Trend (2018-2025)

Consistent tracking with multiple tests per year provides a better representation of age-related changes.

*   **2018-2019 (3 tests):** Average biological age was 36.1 years.
*   **2020 (6 tests):** Average biological age was 35.6 years.
*   **2021 (6 tests):** Average biological age was 35.6 years.
*   **2022 (7 tests):** Average biological age was 33.8 years (best data to date at the time).
*   **2023 (7 tests):** Average biological age was 34.7 years.
*   **2024 (8 tests):** Average biological age was 34.8 years.
*   **2025 (current test):** Biological age is 32.9 years, indicating a positive trend relative to prior years.

Despite the passing of chronological time, the biological age has not increased, suggesting successful resistance to age-related changes in the nine PhenoAge biomarkers since 2018-2019. It's important to note that even if all biomarkers remained constant, PhenoAge is expected to increase by 0.9 years per chronological year. Based on this, starting from the 2020 average of 35.6 years, the expected average for 2025 would be 39.2 years (35.6 + (0.9 * 4 years)). The current reading of 32.9 years is significantly lower than this expectation, indicating the current health approaches are effective.

## Comprehensive Blood Biomarker Analysis

Beyond the PhenoAge biomarkers, a comprehensive analysis of various organ systems is undertaken to identify weak spots and opportunities for optimization to slow aging and maximize lifespan.

### Lipoproteins

*   **HDL:** 61 mg/dL. This marks 14 consecutive tests where HDL has been >= 50 mg/dL, with an average of 56.3 mg/dL over this period.
*   **Triglycerides:** 58 mg/dL. This is close to the optimal range of <45 mg/dL for the lowest risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality.
*   **LDL:** 77 mg/dL. This falls within the optimal range of 65-120 mg/dL for the lowest risk of CHD mortality.

### Inflammation

*   **High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP):** 0.2 mg/L. This is the 22nd consecutive test where hsCRP is less than or equal to the detection limit of 0.3 mg/L.
*   **Homocysteine:** 9.8 µmol/L. While not above the reference range (>11 µmol/L), this is a weak spot. Values 15 years ago were in the 5-6 µmol/L range, indicating a potential age-related shift, not a genetic issue.

#### Homocysteine Interventions Tried:

*   High-dose Trimethylglycine (TMG) (4 grams/day): No significant effect.
*   Folate + B6: No significant effect.
*   Serine + B6: No significant effect.
*   Methyl B12: Reduced homocysteine by approximately 10% (e.g., from 11 to 10 µmol/L), but this was not a major improvement.
*   N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) (1.5 grams/day): Based on two clinical trials showing reduction, this was attempted for the current test but did not significantly alter the value (9.8 µmol/L is within the usual range without supplementation).

Optimization of homocysteine remains an ongoing focus.

### Metabolic Health

*   **Glucose:** 84 mg/dL. This is lower than the 55-test average of 90 mg/dL since 2015, which is superficially good news as glucose increases during aging.
*   **Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c):** 5.4%. This is the highest reading since 2015 and the highest of only five tests performed in the past 10 years. This indicates a potential subtle decline in long-term glycemic control. HbA1c will be included in all future tests for more consistent tracking.

### Kidney Function

*   **Creatinine:** 0.72 mg/dL. This is the lowest value ever recorded and is particularly positive considering the 57-test average of 0.94 mg/dL since 2015. Creatinine levels generally increase with aging due to reduced kidney function.
*   **Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN):** 11 mg/dL. This is an increase from 9 mg/dL in the previous test, without a corresponding increase in protein intake. An increase in BUN can suggest reduced kidney efficiency in urea removal.
*   **Cystatin C:** 0.79 mg/L. This has increased from 0.71 mg/L in the previous measurement (the second time this marker has been tested). As Cystatin C increases during aging, this upward trend is a concern. Cystatin C will be included in all future tests for consistent monitoring.

### Liver Function

*   **Albumin:** 4.9 g/dL. This is within the youthful range.
*   **Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP):** <48 U/L. Values below 48 U/L are associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality.
*   **AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) & ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase):** Both are close to optimal, typically in the high teens or low twenties, which are associated with the lowest risk for all-cause mortality (following a J-shaped curve).
Liver health and function appear to be robust.

### Immunoglobulin G (IgG)

IgG is a significant biomarker to track due to its association with aging and lifespan extension in studies where it has been reduced (e.g., calorie restriction, exercise, parabiosis). IgG levels typically increase during aging. The current IgG level is 1380 mg/dL. Due to limited data on all-cause mortality risk for IgG, ongoing biomarker-to-biomarker correlation analysis will be used to identify optimal ranges within personal data. IgG will be included in all future blood tests.

### Thyroid Hormones

*   **Context:** Diagnosed as hypothyroid in the twenties, on Levothyroxine (T4) for approximately half of life.
*   **Free T4 (inactive):** 1.1 ng/dL.
*   **Free T3 (active):** 2.0 pg/mL.
*   **Free T3:Free T4 Ratio:** 0.18. This ratio is considered relatively low, comparable to the average found in 90-year-olds, while healthy youth (20-30 years old) typically exhibit values double this.
*   **Planned Intervention:** Discussions are underway with the primary care physician and endocrinologist to switch the prescription from Levothyroxine (T4) to Triiodothyronine (T3) to improve the T3:T4 ratio.

### Fibrinogen

Fibrinogen is the third most abundant protein in blood (258 mg/dL, approximately three times higher concentration than glucose or LDL). Along with Albumin (5 g/dL) and Globulins (e.g., IgG at 1000 mg/dL), focusing on highly abundant proteins is critical for comprehensive biomarker optimization. Fibrinogen levels typically increase during aging; thus, the current value of 258 mg/dL (on the lower side of the reference range) is considered good news. Fibrinogen will be measured annually unless significant deviations are observed.

### White Blood Cells (WBC) & Differential

*   **White Blood Cells (WBC):** 3.4 x 10^3/µL. Values less than 3.5 x 10^3/µL are associated with shorter life expectancy compared to 3.5-6.0 x 10^3/µL.
*   **Neutrophils:** 1727 cells/µL. These are slightly low. Optimal values for lowest risk of all-cause mortality are typically around 2000-3000 cells/µL. Neutrophils increase during aging. Given that pro-inflammatory cytokines (Interleukin-6, TNF-alpha) are low or below detection limits, the slightly low neutrophil count is less concerning, as low counts in the context of high inflammation can indicate immune deficiency.
*   **Lymphocytes:** <1550 cells/µL. This marks the fourth out of seven tests with values below 1550 cells/µL. Optimal values for lowest risk of all-cause mortality are typically around 2000 cells/µL, and lymphocytes decline during aging. While calorie intake (2120 kcal for this test, similar to previous) is positively correlated with lymphocyte counts in personal data, other correlations are being investigated to consistently bring lymphocyte counts closer to 2000 cells/µL.

### Red Blood Cell Related Measures

Red blood cells are the most abundant circulating cell type.

*   **Hemoglobin:** 14.5 g/dL. This is trending downwards from a long-term average of 15 g/dL (54-test average since 2015) and a 2024 average of 14.8 g/dL. Hemoglobin declines during aging, so this downward trend is an area of focus for early intervention.
*   **Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV):** 92.8 fL. This is on the higher side of the personal range, though not the highest. Lower values (high 80s) are targeted.
*   **Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW):** 11.8%. This is a positive finding. RDW is a major predictor for PhenoAge and has been identified as an important predictor of lifespan in Little (dwarf) mice regardless of diet. A low RDW is considered a pro-longevity strategy, and values increase during aging.

### Hormones

*   **DHEA Sulfate (DHEA-S):** 120 µg/dL. Data from 15 years ago showed values of 300 µg/dL, suggesting a possible age-related decline or previous supplementation. The 19-test average since 2022 is 125 µg/dL, so the current value is consistent. The goal is to avoid further age-related decline. DHEA-S is tracked as a representative androgen, as androgens as a group decline with aging, though testosterone levels remain consistently high (around 900 ng/dL). DHEA-S will be monitored in all future tests.
*   **Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA):** 0.28 ng/mL. This value is on the lower side of the range from five sporadic tests over the past 10 years, which is good news for prostate cancer risk. PSA will be tested approximately once per year.
