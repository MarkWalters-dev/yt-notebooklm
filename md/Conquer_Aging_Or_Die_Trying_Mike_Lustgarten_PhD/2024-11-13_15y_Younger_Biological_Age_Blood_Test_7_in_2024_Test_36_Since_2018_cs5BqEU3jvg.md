# 2024-11-13 15y Younger Biological Age Blood Test 7 in 2024 Test 55 Since 2015

## Executive Summary

*   The latest biological age test (PhenoAge) indicates a biological age of 36.5 years, which is 15.2 years younger than the chronological age. This represents approximately 75% of the theoretical maximum reduction possible with this test.
*   Over the past four years, the individual has successfully resisted age-related increases in biological age, suggesting improvement in underlying biomarkers despite expected chronological aging.
*   Key biomarkers showing positive trends include consistently high HDL (>= 50 mg/dL for 12 tests), improved triglycerides (currently 57, aiming for < 40), and persistently low high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HSCRP < 0.3 mg/L for 20 tests).
*   While creatinine is near the historical average, other kidney function markers (blood urea nitrogen, uric acid) suggest stable or improved kidney health.
*   Lymphocyte counts have trended upwards towards optimal levels, indicating a positive shift away from age-related decline.

## Biological Age Assessment (PhenoAge)

*   **Latest Result:** 36.5 years biological age.
*   **Chronological Age Difference:** 15.2 years younger than chronological age.
*   **Significance:** Represents ~75% of the theoretical maximum biological age reduction (20 years).
*   **Biomarkers Utilized by PhenoAge:**
    *   Liver health: Albumin, Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)
    *   Kidney function: Creatinine
    *   Metabolic health: Glucose
    *   Inflammation: High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HSCRP)
    *   White blood cell measures: Lymphocyte percentage, White Blood Cells (WBCs)

## Biological Age Trends Since 2018

*   **2018-2019:** Average biological age of 36.1 years (3 tests).
*   **2020-2021:** Average biological age of 35.6 years (6 tests each year).
*   **2022:** Average biological age of 33.8 years (7 tests) - Best result recorded.
*   **2023:** Average biological age of 34.7 years (7 tests).
*   **2024 (to date):** Average biological age of 34.9 years (7 tests).
*   **Age-Related Increase Avoided:** Despite an expected increase of 0.9 years per chronological year (e.g., 35.6 in 2020 + 4 years * 0.9 = 39.2 expected in 2024), the actual average has remained significantly lower, indicating resistance to age-related biomarker decline.

## Key Biomarker Analysis

### Metabolic & Cardiovascular Health

*   **HDL Cholesterol:**
    *   Current: 63 mg/dL (close to optimal 50-60 mg/dL for men).
    *   Trend: 12 consecutive tests >= 50 mg/dL.
    *   Previous Average (since 2015): 44.7 mg/dL (10-11 mg/dL lower).
    *   Observation: Consistent improvement in maintaining higher HDL levels over the past two years.
*   **Triglycerides:**
    *   Current: 57 mg/dL.
    *   Trend: Improved from 60s-70s in prior tests.
    *   Goal: < 40 mg/dL (associated with lowest coronary heart disease mortality risk).
*   **Glucose:**
    *   Current: 90 mg/dL (slight increase from 87).
    *   Average (since 2015): 89.6 mg/dL.
    *   Observation: Current value is consistent with long-term average.
*   **High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (HSCRP):**
    *   Current: < 0.2 mg/L.
    *   Trend: 20 consecutive tests < 0.3 mg/L (lab's limit of detection).

### Kidney Function

*   **Creatinine:**
    *   Current: 0.98 mg/dL.
    *   2024 Low: 0.82 mg/dL (indicates better function).
    *   Average (since 2015): 0.95 mg/dL.
    *   Observation: Current value is on the higher side of the 2024 range but consistent with long-term average.
*   **Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN):**
    *   Current: 9 mg/dL.
    *   Observation: Towards the lower end of the typical range, suggesting stable kidney function.
*   **Uric Acid:**
    *   Current: Flagged as "low" by the lab.
    *   Observation: Not elevated, which would be expected with suboptimal kidney function. Indicates no adverse impact on kidney health despite creatinine level.

### Liver Function

*   **Albumin:**
    *   Current: 5.0 g/dL.
    *   Observation: Consistent with a "youthful" level.
*   **AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase):**
    *   Current: Within the optimal range (high teens to low twenties) for reducing all-cause mortality risk.
*   **ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase):**
    *   Current: In the mid-twenties.
    *   Observation: Slightly higher than the optimal range, which has a U-shaped association with mortality risk.
*   **Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT):**
    *   Observation: Considered a potentially better marker of liver health. Previous lower levels suggest ALT/AST may not be a significant concern. GGT will be included in future tests for clearer interpretation (lower is better, linearly associated with increased all-cause mortality risk).

### Thyroid Hormones

*   **Free T4 & Free T3:**
    *   Free T3 is the active form. Conversion of Free T4 to Free T3 declines with aging.
    *   **2024 Ratio (Free T3/Free T4):** Lowest ratio observed across five tests this year.
    *   Action: Correlation analysis planned to identify interventions to improve this ratio.

### Red Blood Cell Indices

*   **Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV):**
    *   Current: 93.5 fL (decreased from 94.7 fL in the previous test).
    *   Correlation: Higher intake of cocoa bean is associated with lower MCV in the data.
    *   Observation: MCV is a "weak spot" targeted for improvement as higher values are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW):**
    *   Current: 12.0% (youthful).
    *   Significance: A major contributor to the young biological age calculation.

### Immune System

*   **Lymphocytes:**
    *   Current: ~1900/µL (second consecutive test close to optimal ~2000/µL).
    *   Trend: Three tests earlier in 2024 were below 1600/µL (indicating age-related decline).
    *   Observation: Recent results show a positive trend towards optimal levels, moving away from age-related decline.

### Hormone Levels

*   **DHEA Sulfate:**
    *   Current: 126 ng/dL.
    *   Average (last 26 months/17 tests): Similar to current level, indicating resistance to age-related decline over this period.
    *   Historical Data (15 years ago): ~300 ng/dL (potentially due to DHEA supplementation at the time).
    *   Goal: Increase naturally back towards ~300 ng/dL without supplementation, if possible.
