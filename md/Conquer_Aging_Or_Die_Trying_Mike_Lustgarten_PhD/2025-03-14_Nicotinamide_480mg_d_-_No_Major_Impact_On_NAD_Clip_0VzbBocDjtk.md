# 2025-03-14 Nicotinamide 480mg d - No Major Impact On NAD Clip

## Executive Summary

*   Nicotinamide supplementation at 480mg daily did not significantly impact NAD levels.
*   Published data suggests a 10% average increase in energy levels from nicotinamide.
*   A clinical trial indicated that nicotinamide increased energy levels in approximately 30% of participants by about 30%.
*   The effectiveness of nicotinamide supplementation for energy levels appears to be dependent on individual baseline NAD levels.

## Human Evidence

### Nicotinamide and Energy Levels

*   Published data indicates that, on average, energy levels increased by approximately 10%.
*   A clinical trial conducted by the speaker's group showed that nicotinamide could increase energy levels in about 30% of participants, with an average increase of around 30% within that subgroup.
*   This is described as being "very consistent" with the published clinical trial findings.

### Assessing Supplement Effectiveness

*   It is important to consider both the percentage of individuals experiencing a benefit and the magnitude of that benefit.
*   The speaker suggests that if an individual is taking approximately 1000mg of nicotinamide, their NAD levels are "more likely not optimized."
*   Individuals interested in the supplement are advised to test their NAD levels to determine if supplementation is beneficial for them.
