# 2021-07-31 Dietary CD38 Inhibitors - Are They Correlated With Biological Age

## Executive Summary

*   NAD levels decline with age due to increased activity of the NAD-degrading protein CD38. Dietary CD38 inhibitors (Apigenin, Quercetin, Luteolin, Curramanin) are hypothesized to counteract this decline.
*   A personal study analyzing over 1100 days of food intake and 16 blood tests found no significant correlation between daily Apigenin intake (ranging 24-78 mg/day) and Levine's biological age or any of its component biomarkers.
*   Expanding the analysis to the sum of four dietary CD38 inhibitors (Apigenin, Quercetin, Luteolin, Curramanin), with daily intake ranging from 160-387 mg/day, no significant correlation was found with overall biological age as calculated by Levine's PhenoAge or Aging.AI.
*   At the biomarker level, higher total CD38 inhibitor intake correlated with lower fasting glucose (a positive aging trend) but also with lower platelets and red blood cells (negative aging trends).
*   The study concludes that dietary intake of CD38 inhibitors within the observed range (up to 387 mg/day) was not sufficient to significantly impact overall blood biomarker-based metrics of biological age.

## Background: NAD, CD38, and Aging

NAD is vital for the health and function of virtually every organ and tissue system in the body. However, NAD levels decline during aging. One reason for this decline is an age-related increase in CD38, a protein that degrades NAD.

CD38 inhibitors, including Apigenin, Quercetin, Luteolin, and Curramanin, can inhibit CD38, potentially raising NAD levels or slowing the age-related decline of NAD. These metabolites are found in various foods. The central question explored is whether consuming an abundance of foods rich in these dietary CD38 inhibitors can maximize NAD levels and contribute to maintaining youthfulness.

## Study Methodology

The speaker's personal study utilized extensive dietary and blood test data. Food intake has been weighed and logged since 2015, with actual food amounts and intake recorded consistently since July 2018, providing over 1100 days of food intake data corresponding to 16 blood tests.

The approach to determine if dietary CD38 inhibitor intake correlated with biological age involved several steps:

### Protocol for Calculating CD38 Inhibitor Intake

1.  **Quantify Inhibitor Content in Foods:**
    *   Data on milligrams of Apigenin, Quercetin, and Luteolin per gram of specific foods (e.g., peppermint, parsley, oregano) was utilized.
    *   Curramanin content was determined using a separate dataset.
2.  **Determine Average Daily Food Intake for Dietary Periods:**
    *   A 'dietary period' was defined as the time between two consecutive blood tests.
    *   A period began on the day of a fasted blood test and ended the day before the subsequent blood test.
    *   The average daily intake of each food during this period was correlated with the blood test results obtained at the *end* of the period.
    *   For example, average daily intake from July 10, 2018, to August 20, 2018, corresponded to the blood test on August 21, 2018.
3.  **Calculate Average Daily Inhibitor Content per Food:**
    *   For each food, the inhibitor content (milligrams per gram of food) was multiplied by the average daily intake of that food (grams per day) during the corresponding dietary period.
4.  **Sum Total Daily Inhibitor Content:**
    *   The Apigenin content from all foods was summed for each dietary period to determine the total average daily Apigenin intake.
    *   Similarly, the total average daily intake for Quercetin, Luteolin, and Curramanin was calculated, and then a grand sum for all four inhibitors was determined for each dietary period.

### Data for Analysis

*   **Apigenin Intake:** Daily Apigenin content was calculated for each food within each dietary period. The primary source of Apigenin in the diet was parsley. The summed Apigenin intake for each dietary period was then used for correlation analysis.
*   **Total CD38 Inhibitor Intake:** The average daily intake for Apigenin, Quercetin, Luteolin, and Curramanin was calculated for each dietary period. The sum of these four inhibitors represented the total dietary CD38 inhibitor intake. The majority (69%) of total CD38 inhibitor intake came from Curramanin, largely due to high consumption of berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries).

### Correlation Analysis

The calculated daily inhibitor intakes were correlated with blood test data. Key metrics included:

*   **Levine's Phenotypic Age (PhenoAge):** A metric of biological age derived from nine blood biomarkers (glucose, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, CRP, lymphocyte percent, MCV, RDW, WBC).
*   **Aging.AI:** Another biological age score, based on 19 blood biomarkers.

Statistical significance was determined using a p-value less than 0.05, and the strength and direction of correlation were assessed by the correlation coefficient (r).

## Findings: Apigenin Intake and Biological Age

Daily Apigenin intake was correlated with the nine biomarkers used in Levine's Phenotypic Age calculation and the overall biological age score.

*   **Missing Data:** Some biomarker measurements were unavailable due to external factors (e.g., alkaline phosphatase not measured by a doctor, inconsistent hs-CRP measurements in early tests, unreliable red blood cell data due to shipping delays). This resulted in 11 available biological age measurements out of 16 dietary periods.
*   **Results:** No statistically significant correlations were observed between daily Apigenin intake and Levine's biological age test or any of its component biomarkers. The p-values for all correlations were greater than 0.05.
*   **Apigenin Intake Range:** Daily Apigenin intake ranged from 24 to 78 milligrams per day during the study periods.

## Findings: Sum of Dietary CD38 Inhibitors and Biological Age

The sum of the four dietary CD38 inhibitors (Apigenin, Quercetin, Luteolin, Curramanin) was correlated with blood-based metrics of biological age. The total dietary CD38 inhibitor intake ranged from 160 to 387 milligrams per day.

### Correlation with Levine's PhenoAge

*   **Overall PhenoAge Score:** The correlation coefficient (r) was very weak, and the p-value was not statistically significant. This indicates that the sum of these four dietary CD38 inhibitors was not significantly correlated with the overall biological age score generated by Levine's test.
*   **Component Biomarkers:** Of the nine biomarkers on Levine's test, only **glucose** showed a statistically significant correlation (p < 0.05). This was a negative correlation, indicating that higher dietary CD38 inhibitor intake was associated with lower levels of fasting glucose, which is a desirable direction as glucose levels typically increase with aging. However, this effect on glucose was not sufficient to impact the overall biological age score.

### Correlation with Aging.AI

*   **Overall Aging.AI Score:** An inverse correlation was observed, suggesting that higher dietary CD38 inhibitor intake correlated with a younger Aging.AI age. However, this correlation was not statistically significant (p-value > 0.05).
*   **Component Biomarkers:**
    *   **Glucose:** The same negative correlation with glucose was observed as with Levine's data.
    *   **Platelets:** An inverse correlation was found; higher dietary CD38 inhibitor intake correlated with lower platelet counts. This is considered to be in the "wrong" direction, as platelet levels tend to decline with aging.
    *   **Red Blood Cells (RBC):** An inverse correlation was also observed; higher dietary CD38 inhibitor intake correlated with lower red blood cell counts. This is also considered to be in the "wrong" direction, as RBC levels typically decline with aging.

## Conclusion

The study indicates that, for the individual observed, dietary intake of Apigenin (24-78 mg/day) and the combined intake of Apigenin, Quercetin, Luteolin, and Curramanin (160-387 mg/day) were not significantly correlated with overall blood biomarker-based metrics of biological age (Levine's PhenoAge or Aging.AI).

While higher intake of CD38 inhibitors did correlate with a positive change in one biomarker (lower fasting glucose), these effects were not enough to significantly impact overall biological age scores. Furthermore, correlations with other biomarkers (platelets, red blood cells) were in directions generally associated with advanced aging. This suggests that the studied range of dietary CD38 inhibitor intake may be insufficient to produce a measurable impact on biological age.
