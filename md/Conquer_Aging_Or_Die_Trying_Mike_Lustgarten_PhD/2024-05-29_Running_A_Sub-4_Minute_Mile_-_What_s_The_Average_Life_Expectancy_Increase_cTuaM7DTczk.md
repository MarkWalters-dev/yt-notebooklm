# 2024-05-29 Running A Sub-4 Minute Mile - What s The Average Life Expectancy Increase

## Executive Summary

*   A recent study on the first 200 male sub-4 minute milers found a significant 4.7-year increase in life expectancy compared to a matched general population.
*   These findings are consistent with previous research on general exercise capacity and longevity in men.
*   Men with a peak exercise capacity of 10-12 METs (VO2 max 35-43), classified as fit or highly fit, lived an average of 4.5 years longer than those in the lowest 20th percentile for VO2 max.
*   Extremely fit men (top 2nd percentile for VO2 max) showed an even greater benefit, living 6 years longer than the lowest 20th percentile.
*   Data on the longevity of sub-4 minute milers is currently exclusive to men, as the fastest mile run by a woman to date is approximately 4 minutes and 8 seconds.

## Longevity of Sub-4 Minute Milers

A recently published study examined the longevity of the first 200 men to run a sub-4 minute mile, tracking survival up to 70 years after achieving this feat. The data indicates that male sub-4 minute milers experienced a significant increase of 4.7 years in life expectancy relative to a matched general population. The survival curve for these runners was shifted to the right when compared with the matched general population, illustrating a prolonged survival period.

It is important to note that these data are exclusively in men. The fastest mile run by a woman to date is approximately 4 minutes and 8 seconds.

## General Exercise Capacity and Life Expectancy

These findings align with a previously published study on the relationship between exercise capacity and longevity in men:

*   Men with a peak exercise capacity of 10 to 12 METs (equivalent to a VO2 max of 35 to 43), classified as fit and highly fit, lived an average of 4.5 years longer compared to individuals in the lowest 20th percentile for VO2 max.
*   For individuals classified as extremely fit, representing the top 2nd percentile of VO2 max, the average life expectancy increased by 6 years when compared with the lowest 20th percentile for VO2 max.
