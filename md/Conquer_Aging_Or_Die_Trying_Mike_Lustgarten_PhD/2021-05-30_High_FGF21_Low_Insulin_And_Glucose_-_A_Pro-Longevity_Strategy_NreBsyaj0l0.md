# 2021-05-30 High FGF21 Low Insulin And Glucose - A Pro-Longevity Strategy

## Executive Summary

*   Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF21) overexpression in mice significantly extends average lifespan in both sexes and maximal lifespan in females, often outperforming interventions like alpha-ketoglutarate, berberine, and 20% caloric restriction.
*   Human FGF21 levels increase with obesity and aging, indicating a complex role in metabolism.
*   Offspring of centenarians, who exhibit reduced all-cause mortality and lower risks of cancer and cardiovascular disease, have significantly higher circulating FGF21 levels compared to healthy controls and patient groups.
*   Centenarian offspring also show lower fasting glucose and insulin levels, a pattern mirrored in aged FGF21 overexpressing mice.
*   High FGF21 levels, particularly when accompanied by relatively lower glucose and insulin, are proposed as a pro-longevity strategy.

## FGF21 and Lifespan in Mice

FGF21 overexpression in animals leads to significantly higher systemic FGF21 levels, typically 5 to 10-fold greater than wild-type (WT) animals in both fed and fasted states. This overexpression has a notable impact on longevity in C57BL/6J mice.

### Male Mice

FGF21 overexpression significantly extended the average lifespan of male mice. Controls lived an average of 28 months, while FGF21 overexpressing mice lived 36 months. Maximum lifespan, however, was not significantly extended, with both groups reaching approximately 42 months.

### Female Mice

In female mice, FGF21 overexpression extended both average and maximal lifespan. Controls lived an average of 30 months, whereas FGF21 overexpressing mice lived 40 months (a 10-month, approximately 30% increase). The experiment was stopped at 43 months, so the full maximal lifespan extension for these mice remains unknown beyond this point.

## Comparison with Other Interventions

The lifespan-extending effects of FGF21 overexpression were compared against two other recently popularized interventions in C57BL/6J mice: alpha-ketoglutarate and berberine.

### Alpha-Ketoglutarate (AKG)

AKG supplementation extended both average and maximal lifespan in pooled data, with all mice deceased by 37 months.

*   **Average Lifespan (Females):** AKG-supplemented mice lived 31 months, while FGF21 overexpressing mice lived 40 months (approximately 30% longer).
*   **Maximum Lifespan (Females):** AKG-supplemented female mice lived 38 months, while FGF21 overexpressing female mice lived at least 43 months.
*   **Average Lifespan (Males):** AKG did not significantly extend male lifespan compared to controls. However, FGF21 overexpressing male mice lived 36 months, compared to 31 months for AKG-supplemented male mice.

Overall, FGF21 overexpression appears to be a more effective intervention for lifespan extension than AKG.

### Berberine

Berberine supplementation increased both average and maximal lifespan in male C57BL/6J mice, but no mice in this study (berberine or WT controls) lived past 26 months.

*   **Average Lifespan (Males):** Berberine-supplemented mice lived 23 months, while FGF21 overexpressing mice lived 36 months.
*   **Maximum Lifespan (Males):** FGF21 overexpressing male mice reached 42 months, while no berberine-supplemented or control male mice in that study lived past 26 months.

FGF21 overexpression demonstrated a substantially greater lifespan extension compared to berberine supplementation.

## Caloric Restriction (CR) Comparison

FGF21 overexpression was also compared against the "gold standard" for lifespan extension in C57BL/6J mice: 20% caloric restriction (CR).

### Female Mice

*   **Average Lifespan:** 20% CR female mice lived 36 months, while FGF21 overexpressing female mice lived 40 months.
*   **Maximum Lifespan:** 20% CR female mice lived 45 months. FGF21 overexpressing female mice lived at least 43 months (experiment stopped), suggesting comparable maximal lifespan extension.

### Male Mice

*   **Average Lifespan:** 20% CR male mice lived 33 months, while FGF21 overexpressing male mice lived 36 months.
*   **Maximum Lifespan:** Both 20% CR and FGF21 overexpressing male mice had a maximum lifespan of 42 months.

Based on this data, FGF21 overexpression appears to provide a higher average lifespan for both female and male mice compared to 20% CR.

## Human FGF21 Regulation and Context

FGF21 levels in humans can be influenced by various interventions:

*   **Increased by:** Starvation/fasting, low methionine diet, low protein diet, high-fat ketogenic diet, exercise.
*   **Also increased by:** Obesity and aging.

### FGF21 and Obesity

There is a positive correlation between Body Mass Index (BMI) and circulating FGF21 levels. Higher BMI is associated with higher systemic FGF21, observed in both healthy controls and Type 2 diabetic patients.

### FGF21 and Aging

FGF21 levels increase with age. Adults over 70 years old have approximately twofold higher circulating FGF21 levels compared to adults under 40. A larger study showed a clear increase in FGF21 from children (5 years old, ~156 pg/mL) to older adults (80 years old, ~358.5 pg/mL).

## FGF21 in Centenarian Offspring

To understand whether elevated FGF21 during aging is beneficial, researchers studied centenarian offspring (children of individuals living over 100 years).

### Health Benefits in Centenarian Offspring

Centenarian offspring generally exhibit better health and longevity compared to age-matched controls, evidenced by significantly lower all-cause mortality risk, as well as reduced risk for cancer-related and cardiovascular disease-related mortality:

*   Total Mortality: 62% decrease
*   Cancer Mortality: 71% decrease
*   Cardiovascular Disease Mortality: 85% decrease

### FGF21 Levels in Centenarian Offspring

Centenarian offspring (OFF) had significantly higher circulating FGF21 levels compared to:
*   Healthy controls (HC)
*   Type 2 diabetic patients without complications (T2D-NC)
*   Type 2 diabetic patients with complications (T2D-C)
*   Alzheimer's disease patients (AD)

This suggests that high FGF21 levels may be a pro-longevity marker in humans, consistent with the animal data.

### Glucose and Insulin in Centenarian Offspring

Centenarian offspring also exhibit significantly lower fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels compared to their partners (who did not have centenarian parents).

## Proposed Pro-Longevity Strategy: High FGF21, Low Insulin, Low Glucose

This metabolic pattern of high FGF21 combined with low glucose and insulin is also observed in aged FGF21 overexpressing mice.

### FGF21 Overexpressing Mice

*   **Male Mice:** Old FGF21 overexpressing male mice had approximately half the insulin levels and significantly reduced glucose levels compared to wild-type mice.
*   **Female Mice:** Old FGF21 overexpressing female mice showed insulin levels about half that of wild-type mice (approaching statistical significance, p=0.08) and significantly lower glucose levels.

Considering all these findings, having high FGF21 levels in conjunction with relatively lower glucose and insulin levels appears to be a strong indicator of a pro-longevity state.
