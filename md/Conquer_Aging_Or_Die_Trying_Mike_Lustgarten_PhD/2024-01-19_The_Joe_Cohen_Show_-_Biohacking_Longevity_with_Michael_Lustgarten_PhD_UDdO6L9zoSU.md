# 2024-01-19 The Joe Cohen Show - Biohacking Longevity with Michael Lustgarten PhD

**Executive Summary:**

*   **NAD Precursors and Epigenetic Aging:** Very high doses of NAD precursors (e.g., 600mg nicotinic acid, 2g NMN) were observed to increase DunedinPACE (a measure of epigenetic aging) in personal experiments, suggesting a potential for an adverse effect on aging biomarkers at supra-optimal levels. Lower doses (e.g., 60mg nicotinic acid, 200-250mg niacin) were associated with lower DunedinPACE scores.
*   **Individualized Dietary Fat Response:** In a self-experiment, increasing dietary fat intake (e.g., to 115-120g/day from whole foods) correlated with increased fasting glucose, Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW), and C-reactive protein (CRP), which reversed when fat intake was reduced (to 80g/day). This highlights the importance of personalized dietary adjustments based on biomarker data.
*   **Optimal Liver Enzyme Ranges for Mortality:** Large-scale population studies (16.6 million people) indicate a U-shaped or J-shaped mortality risk for ALT and AST, with the lowest all-cause mortality risk found in median ranges (e.g., 18-22 U/L for ALT and 21-23 U/L for AST), and increased risk at both very low (<17 U/L) and higher (>29 U/L) levels. GGT showed a dose-dependent relationship, where lower levels were associated with better outcomes.
*   **Ergothioneine Degradation by Gut Microbiome:** Ergothioneine (a protective antioxidant) can be degraded into Trimethylamine (TMA) by gut bacteria through the enzyme ergothioneinase, which is more active in an alkaline gut pH. As gut pH tends to become more alkaline with aging, this mechanism may contribute to lower ergothioneine and higher TMAO levels, potentially impacting kidney and cardiovascular health.
*   **Sex-Specific Effects of Soluble Fiber in Mice:** A high soluble fiber diet in aged mice resulted in significant fat mass loss in both male and female mice. However, only female mice showed improved treadmill endurance capacity, even when consuming the same amount of food as controls, suggesting potential sex-specific effects of dietary fiber on physical function.

## Lab Markers & Longevity

*   **Objective Markers:** Rely on objective lab markers for longevity goals, as subjective feelings can be misleading.
*   **Optimal Ranges:** For every biomarker, aim for an optimal range associated with the lowest risk of mortality.
*   **Personalized Approach:**
    *   Supplementation is used based on demonstrated need, after exhausting diet, exercise, and sleep adjustments.
    *   Dietary intake is rigorously tracked daily and correlated with blood test results over time (e.g., 50 blood tests since 2015).

## Supplementation Philosophy

*   **Demonstrated Need:** Supplements are considered only when diet, exercise, and sleep cannot optimize a biomarker.
*   **Tolerance Concerns:** A concern exists about potential tolerance development to supplements over time, akin to insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. The idea is to reserve powerful interventions for when they are truly needed.
*   **Minimal Supplement Use:** Current daily supplementation includes only Methyl B12 and Vitamin D (seasonal).
*   **High-Dose Niacin/NAD Precursors:** Experimentation with 600mg/day nicotinic acid significantly increased NAD levels but also increased DunedinPACE, suggesting a potential negative impact on epigenetic aging. Reducing the dose to 60mg/day improved NAD levels without negatively impacting DunedinPACE. Similarly, 2g/day NMN led to high NAD levels, with DunedinPACE results pending.
*   **Niacin for Other Markers:** Previous high-dose niacin intake (1300mg) negatively impacted other labs (increased liver enzymes, lowered thyroid hormones, worsened HbA1c), despite improving subjective well-being. A lower dose (200-250mg) showed better DunedinPACE.
*   **"Kitchen Sink" Approach (Alternative View):** An alternative strategy involved maximizing supplement intake (up to 150 different supplements daily) to optimize every biomarker. This led to identifying adverse effects (e.g., lowered thyroid hormones from niacin, carnitine, propolis) and subsequently removing or reducing problematic supplements.

## DunedinPACE & Biological Age

*   **DunedinPACE:** A measure of the pace of aging.
*   **Impact of Niacin/NAD:** High doses of nicotinic acid (600mg) correlated with a higher DunedinPACE (0.98), while lower doses (60mg) or other interventions led to lower scores (e.8, 0.8, 0.78).
*   **Chronological Age Adjustment:** It's important to standardize DunedinPACE for chronological age and sex, as younger individuals and women naturally tend to have lower scores. The median pace increases with chronological age (e.g., an 80-year-old might average 1.0, a 20-year-old 0.7).
*   **Stress Impact:** Psychosocial stress is identified as a significant factor influencing biological aging and DunedinPACE. Specific supplements are used to manage stress, which is believed to positively impact these markers.
*   **UK Biobank Biological Age Study (Oct 2023):** A new biological age clock, integrating markers like Cystatin C, RDW, GGT, Lymphocyte Percentage, Creatinine, Urea, Albumin, ApoA, and Cholesterol, showed 11% higher predictive value than PhenoAge.
    *   **Cystatin C:** Highest predictor, lower levels are anti-aging.
    *   **RDW:** Second highest predictor, lower levels are anti-aging.
    *   **GGT:** Third highest predictor, lower levels are anti-aging.
    *   **Creatinine & Urea:** In this model, higher levels were associated with lower mortality and reduced biological age, likely due to their correlation with muscle mass and liver function (which decline at end-of-life, leading to lower levels).

## Dietary Approaches

*   **Fat Intake & Glucose/Inflammation:**
    *   Increased fat intake (e.g., 115-120g/day from whole foods) correlated with higher fasting glucose (e.g., in the 90s) in personal data, alongside higher RDW and CRP.
    *   Reducing fat intake (to 80g/day, ~40% of calories) brought fasting glucose back to the 80s.
    *   This suggests individualized responses to fat intake, which can impact glucose and inflammatory markers.
*   **Protein Intake & Urea:** Protein intake influences blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. High protein intake (e.g., >1.6g/kg body weight) can increase urea, which may negatively impact gut tight junctions.
*   **Fiber Intake:**
    *   High fiber intake (85g/day, 5x SAD) is used to optimize health markers.
    *   Megadosing specific fibers (e.g., 100g+ resistant starch, 10-15g inulin) can lead to gastrointestinal issues (bloating, pain) and, in some cases, elevated liver enzymes (inulin).
    *   Resistant starch, particularly derived from corn, is noted for a noticeable "butyrate effect" (relaxation, focus) at optimal doses (e.g., 40g/day, providing 24g resistant starch) without GI distress. Excessive doses (>100g) caused intestinal pain and sleep disruption.
*   **Whole Foods Focus:** Preference for whole foods over protein powders for nutrient density and a lack of bloating issues.
*   **Food Sensitivities:** Individual food sensitivities (e.g., kidney beans, pinto beans) necessitate selective consumption (e.g., chickpeas are well-tolerated).
*   **Fish Intake:** High fish intake (e.g., 500g/day) can cause cognitive impairment due to fat-soluble toxins (dioxins), which can be mitigated with activated charcoal. A daily intake of 100g fish (sardines) is tolerated without issues.
*   **Caloric Restriction:** A gradual, consistent 25% caloric restriction (from 2800 to 2100 calories/day) over three years has been implemented, moving away from past unsuccessful large, rapid cuts.

## Exercise & Physical Function

*   **Workout Regimen:** A mix of whole-body compound movements, calisthenics, weightlifting, mobility, and flexibility. Not based on Peter Attia's specific recommendations.
*   **Bone Density:** DEXA scans show bone density at the upper limit for chronological age, indicating good bone health.
*   **Ligaments & Tendons:** Training joints with specific exercises (e.g., sissy squats) can strengthen ligaments and tendons, improving blood flow to these areas, which typically have limited circulation. This approach is favored over supplements for joint health.
*   **Herniated Disc:** A previous injury from heavy squats and deadlifts in youth necessitates careful training.

## Gut Microbiome & Health

*   **Gut-Muscle Axis Study (Human):** A randomized controlled trial is underway to study the impact of a high soluble fiber, whole-food diet (4x USDA guidelines) on muscle mass and physical function in older adults.
*   **Gut-Muscle Axis Study (Mice):**
    *   A high soluble fiber diet (3x content) in aged mice:
        *   Led to significant fat mass loss in both male and female mice.
        *   Did not impact overall muscle mass or grip strength in the group.
        *   Improved treadmill endurance capacity *only* in female mice, despite both sexes eating the same amount of food.
        *   This suggests sex-specific responses to soluble fiber.
    *   A confounding factor in mice studies is coprophagia (eating their own feces).
*   **Butyrate Production:** The best fiber for butyrate production is debated and individual-dependent, based on the specific gut microbiome composition. Resistant starch is personally found to be highly effective for butyrate production, leading to cognitive benefits.
*   **Gut pH and Ergothioneine:**
    *   **Process Visualization:**
        Aging -> Gut pH becomes more alkaline -> Increased activity of ergothioneinase gene in gut bacteria -> Ergothioneine degradation -> Trimethylamine (TMA) production -> Increased TMAO levels (potentially harmful for kidney/cardiovascular health)
    *   Maintaining an acidic colon pH (through fiber, polyphenols) is proposed as a way to inhibit ergothioneinase activity, preserve ergothioneine, and potentially reduce TMAO.
    *   Centenarians often show a gut pH of 8 and lower ergothioneine levels.
    *   The Ergothioneine to TMAO ratio is being investigated as a predictor of longevity.
*   **Uremic Metabolites:** Tracking of gut bacteria-derived uremic metabolites (e.g., indoxyl sulfate, p-cresol sulfate, TMAO) as early indicators of kidney dysfunction and overall health, even when standard kidney markers (creatinine, cystatin C, BUN) are normal. These are maintained at low levels through diet and lifestyle.

## Other Biomarkers & Insights

*   **Red Blood Cells & Hemoglobin:** Levels of red blood cells and hemoglobin decline with aging. While higher levels are generally desirable, excessively high levels (e.g., hemoglobin >16g/dL) can increase all-cause mortality risk. Optimal ranges for men are generally 14-16g/dL for hemoglobin and 4.6-4.8 x 10^6/µL for red blood cells. High fat intake has been observed to increase these markers beyond optimal levels in personal data.
*   **CRP (C-reactive protein):** Maintained below the limit of detection (<0.3mg/L) for 14-15 consecutive tests.
*   **Total Testosterone:** Maintained at high-normal levels (e.g., 896 ng/dL) naturally, without Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT).
*   **Cholesterol:** Total cholesterol around 160mg/dL, LDL around 80-85mg/dL. Higher saturated fat intake (e.g., from coconut butter) can increase LDL. Optimal LDL management involves high fiber intake (e.g., 85g/day). Large veteran studies (5 million people) suggest that after adjusting for comorbidities, LDL's all-cause mortality risk is primarily above 200mg/dL total cholesterol.
*   **Immune System & Infection:** Conscious exposure to diverse environments (gym, travel) to build immune resilience. Personal experience indicates fighting off infections without getting sick four times, despite previous immune weakness. Sleep and body composition are foundational for immune health.
*   **Eating Window:** A shortened eating window is primarily used to optimize sleep by reducing nighttime urination from high fluid intake with fibrous foods, rather than for direct biomarker impact.
*   **Organic Foods:** Preference for organic foods to limit pesticide burden, though no direct impact on blood tests has been rigorously controlled for.
