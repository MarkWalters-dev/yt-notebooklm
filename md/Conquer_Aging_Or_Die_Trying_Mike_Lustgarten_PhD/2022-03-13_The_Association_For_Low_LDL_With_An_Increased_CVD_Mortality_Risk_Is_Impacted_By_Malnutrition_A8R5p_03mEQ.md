# 2022-03-13 The Association For Low LDL With An Increased CVD Mortality Risk Is Impacted By Malnutrition

## Executive Summary

*   For all age groups, relatively low LDL cholesterol (below 100-120 mg/dL) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality.
*   The "non-HDL cholesterol paradox," where low non-HDL cholesterol is linked to increased CVD mortality, appears to be driven primarily by LDL cholesterol.
*   In patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), the association between low non-HDL cholesterol and increased all-cause mortality risk is significantly reduced when adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities.
*   Malnutrition, defined by low levels of albumin, lymphocytes, and total cholesterol, appears to be the primary driver of the association between low non-HDL cholesterol and increased all-cause mortality risk in CAD patients.
*   Low levels of albumin, lymphocytes, and HDL cholesterol are characteristic of the aged phenotype and decline with aging, potentially explaining the increased CVD mortality risk observed in individuals with low LDL within this context.

## Introduction to the Low LDL Paradox

Data from a study involving approximately 14.9 million individuals not taking lipid-lowering medication indicates that for all age groups, relatively low LDL cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality. The lowest risk for CVD-related mortality was observed in the LDL range of 100 to 120 mg/dL. However, lower LDL levels are associated with an increased mortality risk from CVD.

The apparent paradox of low LDL being linked to increased CVD risk is explored by examining how LDL cholesterol levels change with age. LDL levels generally increase with age until the fifties, after which they decline. Low LDL levels are commonly found in younger individuals.

## The Non-HDL Cholesterol Paradox

A study involving almost 42,000 individuals with coronary artery disease (CAD), published in "Non HDL cholesterol paradox and the effect of underlying malnutrition in patients with coronary artery disease," investigates this phenomenon.

### Defining Non-HDL Cholesterol

*   **Non-HDL Cholesterol Paradox:** Low levels of non-HDL cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of CVD mortality.
*   **Non-HDL Cholesterol Calculation:** Non-HDL cholesterol = Total Cholesterol (TC) - HDL Cholesterol.
    *   More specifically, it comprises LDL + VLDL + Intermediate Density Lipoprotein (IDL).
    *   LDL and VLDL are the primary components of non-HDL cholesterol.

### VLDL Cholesterol and CVD Risk

A study examining the risk for acute myocardial infarction, sudden coronary death, and other coronary deaths in association with VLDL cholesterol concentration found that:

*   Individuals with VLDL cholesterol levels less than 20 mg/dL had the lowest risk for these CVD outcomes compared to those with higher VLDL levels (20-29 mg/dL and >30 mg/dL).
*   Higher levels of VLDL cholesterol were associated with a significantly increased risk of CVD outcomes.

**Conclusion:** Since low VLDL is associated with a *reduced* CVD mortality risk, the non-HDL cholesterol paradox is likely driven predominantly by LDL cholesterol, not VLDL.

### Non-HDL Cholesterol and All-Cause Mortality in CAD Patients (Unadjusted)

In a study involving individuals with an average age of 65 and 80% male participants:

*   The lowest all-cause mortality risk was observed in subjects with a non-HDL cholesterol level of 4 to 5 mmol/L (approximately 155 to 193 mg/dL).
*   A non-HDL cholesterol level less than 85 mg/dL was significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk in CAD patients. This is the "non-HDL cholesterol paradox."
*   It is important to note that this association was unadjusted, meaning other factors could influence the observed relationship.

## Factors Influencing the Non-HDL Cholesterol Association

The association between non-HDL cholesterol and all-cause mortality risk is impacted by several health-related variables:

*   Older age
*   Sex
*   CVD-related comorbidities:
    *   Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)
    *   Hypertension (high blood pressure)
    *   Type 2 Diabetes (elevated blood glucose)
    *   Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD, eGFR < 60)
    *   Anemia (low hematocrit/red blood cell concentration)
    *   Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

When the association between non-HDL cholesterol and all-cause mortality risk is adjusted for these variables:

*   The increased risk associated with lower non-HDL cholesterol is reduced.
*   The lowest all-cause mortality risk shifts to a relatively higher non-HDL cholesterol level, although it borders on statistical significance.
*   The confidence intervals for both the increased risk at lower non-HDL levels and the lowest risk at higher non-HDL levels are near the border of statistical significance, indicating the influence of these adjusted variables.

**Conclusion:** Age, sex, and comorbidities significantly affect the relationship between non-HDL cholesterol and all-cause mortality risk in CAD patients.

## The Impact of Malnutrition

The study title highlights the role of malnutrition. Malnutrition was defined using blood test data for:

*   Albumin
*   Lymphocytes
*   Total Cholesterol

**Note:** Including total cholesterol in these models accounts for HDL cholesterol because Total Cholesterol = Non-HDL Cholesterol + HDL Cholesterol.

When the association between non-HDL cholesterol and all-cause mortality risk is adjusted for these malnutrition markers:

*   The observed relationship changes dramatically.
*   Non-HDL cholesterol levels **greater than 85 mg/dL** are now associated with an **increased** all-cause mortality risk.
*   The **non-HDL cholesterol paradox is eliminated**. A non-HDL cholesterol level **less than 85 mg/dL is now significantly associated with a reduced** all-cause mortality risk in CAD patients.

**Conclusion:** Malnutrition appears to be driving the association between low non-HDL cholesterol and increased all-cause mortality risk in CAD patients.

### Adjusting for Malnutrition and Other Factors

When the malnutrition model is further adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities, the results remain largely the same:

*   Non-HDL cholesterol levels greater than 85 mg/dL are still significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   The association between lower non-HDL cholesterol and reduced all-cause mortality risk persists, although it borders on statistical significance (confidence intervals near a hazard ratio of 1).

**Conclusion:** Malnutrition plays a significant role in the effect of low non-HDL cholesterol on all-cause mortality risk in CAD patients, even when other influencing factors are considered.

## The "Why": Malnutrition and the Aged Phenotype

The question arises: why would malnutrition drive the effect of low non-HDL cholesterol on all-cause mortality risk? This is linked to the aged phenotype, characterized by low levels of albumin, lymphocytes, and HDL.

### Albumin and Aging

*   **Trend:** Albumin levels are high in youth and decline during aging. Serum albumin levels decrease from approximately 46 g/L in men and 45 g/L in women in youth to about 36 g/L in 100-year-olds.
*   **Mortality Risk:** Lower all-cause mortality risk is associated with albumin levels found in youth (46 g/L). As albumin concentration declines with aging, all-cause mortality risk significantly increases.

### Lymphocytes and Aging

*   **Trend:** Lymphocyte counts are high in youth and decline during aging.
*   **Mortality Risk:** The lowest all-cause mortality risk is associated with approximately 2 billion lymphocytes per liter. As lymphocyte levels decline, all-cause mortality risk significantly increases.

### HDL Cholesterol and Aging

*   **Trend:** HDL cholesterol levels are relatively high in youth and decline during aging.
    *   Women: Peaks around 64 mg/dL in youth, steadily declines with aging.
    *   Men: Peaks around 56 mg/dL in youth, with a rapid decline into the thirties, followed by relative stability in the low fifties.
*   **Mortality Risk:** Relatively low HDL cholesterol levels (less than 45 mg/dL for men and less than 55 mg/dL for women) are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.

## Synthesizing the Findings

The increased mortality risk observed with LDL cholesterol levels below 100-120 mg/dL can be explained by considering low LDL within the context of malnutrition.

*   Low albumin, lymphocytes, and HDL cholesterol, which constitute malnutrition and are also characteristic of the aged phenotype, occur concurrently with low LDL.
*   Therefore, the combination of low LDL in the presence of markers of malnutrition and aging may collectively explain the increased cardiovascular mortality risk.
