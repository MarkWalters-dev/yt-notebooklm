# 2024-04-28 Are Turmeric And Black Pepper Bad For Health

## Executive Summary

*   In a six-year self-study with 35 blood tests, both turmeric and black pepper showed predominantly positive (health-resisting age-related decline or mortality risk) unadjusted correlations with 26 biomarkers across various organ systems.
*   After adjusting for body weight, turmeric maintained a net positive association, significantly linked to lower glucose, alkaline phosphatase, neutrophils and monocytes, younger PhenoAge, and lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).
*   Similarly, black pepper, after body weight adjustment, showed a net positive association, significantly linked to lower glucose, higher HDL, lower uric acid, younger PhenoAge, and lower hsCRP.
*   Even with a more restrictive False Discovery Rate (FDR < 0.05) and body weight adjustment, turmeric was associated with lower glucose, alkaline phosphatase, and hsCRP, while black pepper was associated with lower glucose and hsCRP.
*   Across all levels of statistical rigor (unadjusted, body weight adjusted, and FDR adjusted), the net correlative/association scores for both turmeric and black pepper remained positive, suggesting they are not detrimental to health in this individual case.

## Study Methodology

This study involved a six-year analysis of personal dietary intake and 35 blood tests to evaluate the health impact of turmeric and black pepper. The methodology included:

*   **Food Tracking:** Since 2015, all food intake was weighed using a food scale.
*   **Dietary Data Entry:** Daily food amounts were entered into the Cronometer app.
*   **Spreadsheet Integration:** Dietary data (including macros and micros since 2015, and specific food intake since 2018) was manually entered into a spreadsheet.
*   **Correlation Calculation:** For each blood test, the average daily dietary intake for the period leading up to that test was calculated. These averaged dietary intakes were then correlated with corresponding blood biomarker levels.

## Dietary Intake Data

*   **Turmeric Intake:**
    *   Intake varied from low to relatively high over the six-year period, with each data point corresponding to a blood test.
    *   The average turmeric intake during this period was 1.3 grams per day, almost exclusively ground turmeric powder.
    *   More recently, average intake has been closer to 3 grams per day.
*   **Black Pepper Intake:**
    *   Intake also varied, with periods of medium, low, and relatively high consumption.
    *   The average black pepper intake over six years was 0.5 grams per day.
    *   More recently, average intake has been around 2 grams per day.

## Biomarkers Monitored

A panel of 26 biomarkers was analyzed, representing various organ systems:

*   **Metabolic Health:**
    *   Glucose
    *   HDL
    *   LDL

    *   LDL (follows an inverse U-shape during aging, interpretation is complex)

**Net correlative turmeric score (excluding LDL): +8** (12 green - 4 red)

**Black Pepper:**

*   **Positive (Green - 10 correlations):**
    *   Lower Glucose
    *   Higher HDL
    *   Lower Uric Acid
    *   Lower Alkaline Phosphatase

Based on unadjusted correlations, both turmeric and black pepper appeared to be non-detrimental to health, with more positive than negative correlations.

## Confounding by Body Weight

Body weight significantly correlated with several biomarkers, raising the question of whether body weight was driving some of the observed associations with turmeric and black pepper.

*   **Body Weight Overlap Correlations (affecting biomarkers also correlated with turmeric/black pepper):**
    *   **Negative (Red - 7 correlations):**
        *   Lower HDL
        *   Higher Uric Acid
        *   Higher Alkaline Phosphatase
        *   Higher Neutrophils and Monocytes
        *   Higher RDW
        *   Lower Telomere Length
        *   Higher Systolic Blood Pressure
        *   Higher hsCRP
    *   **Positive (Green - 2 correlations):**
        *   Higher Platelets
        *   Higher Red Blood Cells
    *   **Neutral/Tricky (1 correlation):**
        *   Higher LDL

**Net overlap score for body weight: -6** (2 green - 8 red; excluding LDL)
This suggested that body weight could be a confounder, with its overall impact being more negative on these overlapping biomarkers.

## Body Weight Adjusted Associations

To account for body weight as a potential confounder, linear regression models were used to assess the associations of turmeric and black pepper after adjusting for body weight.

**Turmeric (Body Weight Adjusted):**

*   **Significant Positive Associations (Green - 5 correlations):**
    *   Lower Glucose
    *   Lower Alkaline Phosphatase
    *   Lower Neutrophils and Monocytes
    *   Younger PhenoAge
    *   Lower hsCRP
*   **Significant Negative Associations (Red - 2 correlations):**
    *   Lower Platelets
    *   Lower Red Blood Cells
*   **Neutral/Tricky (1 correlation):**
    *   Lower LDL

**Net body weight adjusted turmeric association score: +3** (5 green - 2 red)

**Black Pepper (Body Weight Adjusted):**

*   **Significant Positive Associations (Green - 5 correlations):**
    *   Lower Glucose
    *   Higher HDL
    *   Lower Uric Acid
    *   Younger PhenoAge
    *   Lower hsCRP
*   **Significant Negative Associations (Red - 2 correlations):**
    *   Lower Platelets
    *   Lower Red Blood Cells

**Net body weight adjusted black pepper association score: +3** (5 green - 2 red)

After adjusting for body weight, both turmeric and black pepper continued to show a net positive association with the biomarkers.

## False Discovery Rate (FDR) Adjusted Associations

To further increase statistical rigor and account for multiple comparisons (26 biomarkers), associations were re-evaluated using a restrictive False Discovery Rate (FDR) of less than 0.05.

**Turmeric (Body Weight & FDR Adjusted):**

*   **Significant Positive Associations (Green - 3 correlations):**
    *   Lower Glucose
    *   Lower Alkaline Phosphatase
    *   Lower hsCRP
*   **Significant Negative Associations (Red - 1 correlation):**
    *   Lower Platelets

**Net body weight and FDR adjusted turmeric association score: +2** (3 green - 1 red)

**Black Pepper (Body Weight & FDR Adjusted):**

*   **Significant Positive Associations (Green - 2 correlations):**
    *   Lower Glucose
    *   Lower hsCRP
*   **Significant Negative Associations (Red - 1 correlation):**
    *   Lower Red Blood Cells

**Net body weight and FDR adjusted black pepper association score: +1** (2 green - 1 red)

## Conclusion

Across all analytical approaches—unadjusted correlations, body weight adjusted associations, and body weight and FDR adjusted associations—the net correlative or association scores for both turmeric and black pepper remained positive. This suggests that, based on this data-driven personal analysis across 26 biomarkers, turmeric and black pepper are not detrimental to health and may, in fact, offer potential positive effects.
