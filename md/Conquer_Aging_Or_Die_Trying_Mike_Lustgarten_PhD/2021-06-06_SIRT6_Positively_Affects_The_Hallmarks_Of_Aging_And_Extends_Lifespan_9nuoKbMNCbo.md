# 2021-06-06 SIRT6 Positively Affects The Hallmarks Of Aging And Extends Lifespan

**Executive Summary:**

*   SIRT6 overexpression consistently extends both average and maximal lifespan in mice, demonstrating a more robust and consistent effect compared to SIRT1.
*   SIRT6 positively influences multiple hallmarks of aging, including maintaining telomere length, reducing oxidative stress, promoting DNA damage repair, modulating inflammation by decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and increasing anti-inflammatory ones, and promoting autophagy.
*   While initial findings suggested lifespan extension by SIRT1 activation with resveratrol, subsequent studies on both resveratrol and SIRT1 overexpression have shown inconsistent or no significant lifespan extension.
*   SIRT6 levels can be increased through various interventions, including calorie restriction, specific dietary components like ergothioneine, and both acute aerobic and chronic resistance exercise.
*   Certain compounds, such as quercetin and luteolin, offer a "double whammy" by not only acting as SIRT6 activators but also inhibiting CD38, thereby increasing NAD levels, which are beneficial for health and lifespan.

## NAD and Sirtuins

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is crucial for health and function. Its cellular levels are maintained by a balance of factors:

*   **Factors that Increase NAD:**
    *   Physical activity
    *   Supplementation with NMN (Nicotinamide mononucleotide) or NR (Nicotinamide riboside)
    *   Calorie Restriction (CR)
    *   Inhibitors of CD38
*   **Factors that Decrease NAD:**
    *   Aging
    *   Physical inactivity or sedentary behavior
    *   Caloric excess

Sirtuins are a family of NAD-dependent proteins that can extend lifespan. They function by removing acetyl groups from histones and other proteins. There are seven sirtuins, found in various cellular compartments, including the nucleus, cytosol, and mitochondria (SIRT3, SIRT4, SIRT5).

## SIRT1 and Lifespan

Early research focused on SIRT1's role in lifespan:

*   **Brain-Specific SIRT1 Overexpression:** In a study combining male and female mice, brain-specific SIRT1 overexpression significantly extended average lifespan but did not increase maximal lifespan compared to wild-type controls.
*   **Resveratrol as a SIRT1 Activator:**
    *   Resveratrol was initially shown to extend average lifespan in mice fed a high-calorie diet, compared to mice on a high-calorie diet alone.
    *   **Mechanism of Action:** A high-calorie diet alone resulted in high PGC-1 alpha acetylation, indicative of lower SIRT1 activity. However, combining the high-calorie diet with resveratrol significantly reduced PGC-1 alpha acetylation (by 60-70%), suggesting increased SIRT1 activity.
    *   **Inconsistent Lifespan Effects:** Subsequent studies, however, indicated that both low (300 PPM) and high (1200 PPM) doses of resveratrol did not significantly extend lifespan in either male or female mice.
*   **SIRT1 Overexpression Inconsistencies:** Other studies involving SIRT1 overexpression in mice (across two transgenic lines, combined male/female data, and separated by sex) also showed no significant effect on lifespan.

## SIRT6 and Lifespan

A recent comparative study directly assessed the impact of SIRT1 and SIRT6 overexpression on lifespan in mice. Wild-type mice served as controls.

*   **SIRT1 Overexpression:** Showed no significant increase in either average or maximal lifespan.
*   **SIRT6 Overexpression:** Significantly increased both average and maximal lifespan. This effect was observed in both male and female mice.
*   **SIRT1 + SIRT6 Co-Overexpression:** Did not extend lifespan beyond that observed with SIRT6 overexpression alone, suggesting that the lifespan-extending effect is primarily driven by SIRT6 and is not additively enhanced by co-overexpression of SIRT1.

Other studies also demonstrated that SIRT6 overexpression improved lifespan:

*   Male mice from one transgenic line (Line 55) showed increased average and maximum lifespan.
*   Male mice from another line (Line 108) exhibited increased average but not maximum lifespan.
*   **Caveat:** In some studies, lifespan in SIRT6 transgenic female mice was not extended, indicating potential sex-specific effects in certain contexts.

## Mechanisms of SIRT6 in Aging

SIRT6 positively affects multiple hallmarks of aging:

SIRT6
*   -> Maintains Telomere Length (counteracts telomere shortening during aging)
*   -> Reduces Oxidative Stress (counteracts increased oxidative stress during aging)
*   -> Promotes DNA Damage Repair (repairs single and double-strand DNA breaks)
*   -> Reduces Inflammation (decreases pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF alpha; increases anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10)
*   -> Promotes Autophagy (counteracts the decline in autophagy during aging)

## Activating SIRT6

Can SIRT6 be increased through diet, exercise, or supplements to translate its benefits to aging and lifespan?

### Calorie Restriction

Calorie restriction increases SIRT6. In a study on old male mice (20-24 months, equivalent to approximately a 73-year-old human), a 30% calorie restriction resulted in about a 50% increase in SIRT6 protein levels compared to ad libitum fed mice. This suggests a role for dietary energy intake in modulating SIRT6 levels.

### Ergothioneine

Ergothioneine, referred to as a "longevity vitamin," can increase SIRT6:

*   **In vitro Study (Endothelial Cells):**
    *   Cells exposed to high glucose levels showed lower SIRT6 protein expression.
    *   Adding ergothioneine to control cells (normal glucose) did not significantly impact SIRT6 levels.
    *   However, in cells with high glucose, the addition of ergothioneine significantly increased SIRT6 levels compared to high glucose alone.
*   **Relevance to Aging:** Circulating glucose levels often increase with aging. This raises the question of whether ergothioneine could increase SIRT6 in older adults. Randomized controlled trials are needed to investigate this.

### Other Dietary Activators

Numerous other compounds are known SIRT6 activators. Notably, quercetin and luteolin are also identified as CD38 inhibitors. This means they are involved in mechanisms that not only activate SIRT6 but also increase NAD levels, offering a dual benefit for health and lifespan.

### Exercise

Both acute and chronic exercise can increase SIRT6 levels:

*   **Acute Aerobic Exercise:**
    *   **Protocol:** 30 minutes of running at 80% of VO2 max on a treadmill.
    *   **Participants:** 24-year-old men.
    *   **Results:** SIRT6 expression in white blood cells approximately doubled one hour after exercise compared to pre-exercise and immediately post-exercise levels.
*   **Resistance Exercise Training:**
    *   **Protocol:** 12 weeks of strength training.
    *   **Participants:** 66-year-old men.
    *   **Results:** Increased SIRT6 levels.

This highlights the important role of both cardiovascular and strength training in potentially increasing SIRT6 levels in humans.
