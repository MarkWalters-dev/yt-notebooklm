# 2024-05-26 Thyroid Hormones FT4 FT3 - What s Optimal

## Executive Summary

*   Thyroid hormone metabolism significantly impacts aging and longevity, influencing hallmarks like cell senescence, inflammation, and metabolism.
*   Free Thyroxine (FT4) levels show a biphasic change with age, initially decreasing from youth (20-50 years) and then increasing from 50 to 90 years. Free Triiodothyronine (FT3) generally declines continuously with age for men, with a subtle biphasic pattern for women.
*   The Free T3 to Free T4 ratio consistently decreases with aging, suggesting reduced conversion of T4 to active T3 in older individuals, including centenarians.
*   A lower Free T3 to Free T4 ratio is significantly associated with increased frailty in centenarians and an increased all-cause mortality risk across various age groups.
*   Maintaining a higher Free T3 to Free T4 ratio (e.g., above 0.45, or closer to youthful levels of 0.35-0.38) appears beneficial for health, reduced frailty, and lower mortality risk.

## Thyroid Hormone Metabolism and Aging

Thyroid aging influences and is impacted by many hallmarks of aging, including cell senescence, telomere shortening, inflammation, epigenetics, metabolism, loss of proteostasis, and stem cell renewal.

The metabolism of thyroid hormones follows this pathway:
Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) -> Thyroid Gland produces inactive Thyroxine (T4)
T4 (4 iodine atoms) can be:
    -> Removal of 1 iodine atom -> Active Triiodothyronine (T3)
    -> Converted to reverse T3 (diverts away from active T3 production)
T3 can be:
    -> Degraded into T2 (further reduces active T3 concentration)

Collectively, thyroid hormone metabolism impacts longevity, aging, and age-related disease.

## Age-Related Changes in Free T4

A study of over 83,000 people (ages 20-90 years) observed changes in Free T4 (FT4) levels (in picomolar):

*   **Youth (20-50 years):** Average levels for women were around 13.25 picomolar, and for men, 13.5 picomolar.
*   **Mid-life (50-60 years):** Levels declined to approximately 12.5 picomolar for both sexes.
*   **Older Age (60-90 years):** An age-related increase was observed, with levels rising again.

Comparing these observed age-related changes to the standard reference range (Quest Diagnostics: 0.8-1.8 nanograms per deciliter, which converts to approximately 0.97-1.05 nanograms per deciliter for the observed values) reveals that while levels remain within the reference range, the significant age-related decrease and subsequent increase are missed. This highlights that reference ranges may not capture optimal physiological changes.

## Age-Related Changes in Free T3

Free T3 (FT3) levels (in picomolar) generally decrease during aging:

*   **Youth:** Average values for women were about 4.6 picomolar, and for men, about 4.9 picomolar.
*   **Older Age (90 years):** Values for both sexes were close to 4.1 picomolar.

The decline is relatively continuous for men, while for women, a subtle biphasic pattern (down, then up, then down again) was noted. Similar to FT4, these age-related FT3 declines often remain within standard reference ranges (2.3-4.2 picograms per milliliter, converting to approximately 2.67-3.19 picograms per milliliter for observed values), meaning reliance on reference ranges alone would miss these age-related changes.

## The Free T3 to Free T4 Ratio

As FT3 tends to be lower and FT4 tends to be higher at older ages (after around 50-60 years), this suggests a decreased conversion of FT4 into the active thyroid hormone FT3 during aging. Therefore, the Free T3 to Free T4 ratio can be a more informative biomarker.

*   **Youth (younger than 50-55 years):** Average ratios were about 0.35-0.38 for both women and men.
*   **Aging (20-90 years):** A significant decline in this ratio occurs, reaching values of around 0.31-0.32 at older ages.
*   **Centenarians (older than 90 years):** The ratio is further reduced, ranging from 0.3 to 0.2, and shows a significant inverse correlation with age among the oldest old (up to 113 years).

While a lower ratio in centenarians might suggest it's a marker of longevity, further data indicates otherwise.

## Frailty and Mortality Risk Association with Free T3:Free T4 Ratio

Studies indicate that a lower Free T3 to Free T4 ratio is associated with adverse health outcomes:

*   **Frailty in Centenarians:** In a study of 180 centenarians (average age 102 years), a significant inverse correlation was found between the Free T3 to Free T4 ratio and a frailty index. A lower ratio was associated with greater frailty, and a higher ratio was associated with being less frail. This suggests that while individuals can reach advanced age with a low ratio, higher ratios may be linked to better health and fitness in old age.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk (Younger Adults):**
    *   A study of ~6,200 people (average age 46, median 12-year follow-up) found that a Free T3 to Free T4 ratio less than approximately 0.45 was significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk. Ratios higher than 0.5 were not associated with significantly increased risk.
    *   Another larger study, despite unit conversion issues for its x-axis, showed similar trends: higher ratios were associated with lower all-cause mortality risk, while lower ratios were associated with increased risk.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk (Centenarians):** A study on centenarians (average age 103 years) assessed survival over time:
    *   Cluster 3, with the lowest average Free T3 to Free T4 ratio (0.18), had the shortest median lifespan, living an average of 500 days post-assessment.
    *   Cluster 1, with a higher average ratio (0.24), had a significantly increased median lifespan, living about 400 days (15 months) longer than Cluster 3.

Across these three studies, a relatively lower Free T3 to Free T4 ratio is consistently associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk in both relatively younger adults and the oldest old.

## Personal Strategy for Optimizing Thyroid Hormones

Current personal Free T3 to Free T4 ratio has shown a concerning decline:
*   **October 2022:** Ratio was 0.30.
*   **April 2024:** Ratio decreased to 0.18.

This recent value of 0.18 is consistent with ratios found in short-lived centenarians and represents an age-related decline moving in an undesirable direction. The goal is to raise this ratio, aiming for at least 0.30, and ideally, closer to youthful levels of 0.35-0.38.

**Initial Plan to Increase Free T3:Free T4 Ratio:**

*   **Increase Selenium Intake from Whole Food:** This approach is chosen for its expected lower risk compared to high-dose supplements.
*   **Primary Source:** Brazil nuts.
*   **Current Intake:** Approximately 275 micrograms per day (mostly from Brazil nuts).
*   **Target Intake:** Increase Brazil nut consumption to reach the tolerable upper limit for selenium, which is 400 micrograms per day.
*   **Re-testing:** Thyroid hormones and other biomarkers will be re-tested soon after implementing the increased selenium intake to assess the impact and ensure no other biomarkers are negatively affected. If the strategy is unsuccessful or causes other issues, a new strategy will be developed.
