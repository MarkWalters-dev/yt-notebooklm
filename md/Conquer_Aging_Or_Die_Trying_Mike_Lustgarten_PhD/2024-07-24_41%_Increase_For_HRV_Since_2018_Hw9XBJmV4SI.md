# 2024-07-24 41% Increase For HRV Since 2018

### Executive Summary

*   **Integrated Biomarkers:** Resting heart rate (RHR) and heart rate variability (HRV) are integrated measures reflecting the health of the cardiovascular system, nervous system (sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, including the vagus nerve), and adrenal glands (via norepinephrine and epinephrine).
*   **Age-Related Trends:** Population data indicates that RHR generally increases up to approximately 50 years of age, followed by a decline in older individuals (50-85 years). HRV, measured by RMSSD, consistently declines with age from 20 to at least 80 years.
*   **Context for Low RHR:** A low RHR combined with a *high* HRV is indicative of youthfulness, whereas a low RHR combined with a *low* HRV is expected in advanced aging. HRV provides crucial context for interpreting RHR values.
*   **Personal Biomarker Optimization:** Since 2018, the speaker has significantly improved personal biomarkers, reducing average RHR from 51 beats per minute (bpm) to 42 bpm, and increasing average HRV from 47.3 milliseconds (ms) to 66.6 ms. These changes resist typical age-related declines.
*   **Contributing Factors:** Improvements in RHR and HRV are attributed to optimizing factors such as body weight and exercise prescription (intensity, dose, frequency, and duration).

## Introduction: HRV and Resting Heart Rate as Integrated Biomarkers

Resting heart rate (RHR) and heart rate variability (HRV) are key biomarkers. While localized to the heart, their levels are influenced by multiple organ systems:

*   **Nervous System:** The balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves (including the vagus nerve) impacts RHR and HRV.
*   **Adrenal Gland:** Sympathetic nerve activation of the adrenal gland influences RHR and HRV through the release of norepinephrine and epinephrine.

These metrics thus provide an integrated measure of at least three organ systems. The goal is to optimize these biomarkers for longevity. The speaker has been tracking both metrics since 2018, accumulating over 2100 days of personal data.

## Population Trends: Resting Heart Rate During Aging

Analysis of large datasets reveals consistent patterns in resting heart rate across different age groups:

*   **WHOOP Data (Ages 20-50):** Data for both women and men shows that average resting heart rate increases during aging.
*   **Fitbit Data (Ages 20-85):**
    *   In agreement with WHOOP data, resting heart rate increases up to approximately 50 years.
    *   Following this, a decline is observed from 50 to about 85 years of age.
    *   Relatively low resting heart rates are found in both young and very old age groups. This highlights the need for additional context, such as HRV, to differentiate youthful low RHR from age-related low RHR.

## Population Trends: Heart Rate Variability (HRV) During Aging

To provide context for RHR, it's essential to understand how HRV changes with age:

*   **Fitbit Data (Study of 8.2 million people, Ages 20-60):**
    *   The HRV metric used is RMSSD (root mean squared of successive differences), which is consistent across WHOOP and Fitbit.
    *   Regardless of whether measurements are taken at 6 AM or 6 PM, HRV consistently declines during aging within this age range.
    *   HRV continues to decline at least from 60 to 80 years of age.

## Interpreting Low Resting Heart Rate with HRV Context

Combining RHR and HRV provides a more accurate picture of physiological age:

*   **Youthful Profile (e.g., 20-year-olds):** Expected to have a low resting heart rate (around 62 bpm based on Fitbit data) in conjunction with a relatively high heart rate variability (around 75 ms).
*   **Middle-Aged Profile (e.g., 50-year-olds):** Expected to show a relatively higher resting heart rate and a lower heart rate variability.
*   **Elderly Profile (e.g., 80-85-year-olds):** A low resting heart rate in conjunction with a low heart rate variability would be expected.

## Personal Data: Resting Heart Rate Trends (2018-2024)

The speaker's personal data tracked via WHOOP from August 2018 through June 2024 shows significant improvements:

*   **2018 Baseline:** Average yearly resting heart rate was approximately 51 bpm, close to age-expected levels at that time. Notably, the speaker was more physically active in 2018 (longer weight training, daily low-intensity cardio) than currently.
*   **Consistent Reduction:** From 2019 onward, the average daily resting heart rate was sequentially reduced each year.
*   **2024 Data (First 6 months):** The average resting heart rate is 42 bpm.
*   **Statistical Significance:**
    *   **2018 vs. 2024:** A statistically significant reduction in RHR from 51 bpm (2018) to 42 bpm (2024) is observed (p-value < 1 x 10^-121).
    *   **2023 vs. 2024:** The 2024 average of 42 bpm is significantly lower than the first six months of 2023 (43.7 bpm), with a p-value of 2 x 10^-21.
*   **Resistance to Age-Related Increase:** The speaker has avoided the age-related increase in resting heart rate typically expected between 45 and 50 years, instead showing a consistent decline.

## Personal Data: Heart Rate Variability Trends (2018-2024)

Parallel to RHR improvements, the speaker's HRV has also significantly increased:

*   **2018 Baseline:** Average yearly HRV was 47.3 ms, which was age-expected for 2018 despite high activity levels.
*   **Yearly Progression:**
    *   Increased in 2019 and 2020.
    *   Experienced a regression in 2021, likely linked to weight gain.
    *   Increased again in 2022 and 2023 after getting leaner.
*   **2024 Data (First 6 months):** Average HRV is 66.6 ms.
*   **Overall Improvement:** Since 2018, average HRV has increased from 47 ms to 67 ms, demonstrating that HRV is an individualized metric that can be improved.
*   **Statistical Significance:**
    *   **2018 vs. 2024:** A highly significant improvement in HRV from 47 ms (2018) to 67 ms (2024) is observed (p-value < 3 x 10^-70).
    *   **2023 vs. 2024:** A small but statistically significant improvement of 2.7 ms (p-value = 8 x 10^-5) is noted for 2024 compared to 2023.

## Youthful Biomarker Profile: Speaker's Current Status

The combination of the speaker's current HRV and RHR values indicates a youthful physiological state relative to chronological age:

*   **Current Metrics (2024, first 6 months):**
    *   HRV: 67 ms
    *   RHR: 42 bpm
*   **Chronological Age Expectation:**
    *   HRV: ~35 ms
    *   RHR: ~56 bpm
*   **Comparison:** The speaker's current data for both HRV and RHR are significantly better than what would be expected for their chronological age.
*   **Future Goals:** The speaker aims for further improvement, citing youthful and fit benchmarks observed in others (e.g., HRV of 100 ms, RHR of 40 bpm) as a target.

## Factors Influencing Biomarker Improvements

The improvements in RHR and HRV are attributed to:

*   **Body Weight:** Getting leaner contributed to increased HRV.
*   **Exercise Prescription:** Optimization of exercise intensity, dose, frequency, and duration plays a crucial role.
