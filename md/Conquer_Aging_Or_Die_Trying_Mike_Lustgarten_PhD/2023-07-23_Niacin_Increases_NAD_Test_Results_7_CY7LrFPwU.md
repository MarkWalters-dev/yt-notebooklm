# 2023-07-23 Niacin Increases NAD Test Results

## Executive Summary
*   Niacin (nicotinic acid) supplementation (600 mg/day) significantly increased the speaker's NAD level to 67.4 micromolar, marking the highest level recorded in their self-experiments.
*   Previous attempts to raise NAD using NMN (300-1000 mg/day) and modulators of the de novo NAD synthesis pathway (vitamin B6, grape seed powder) were either ineffective or less effective.
*   A 2020 study demonstrated that niacin (1000 mg/day) increased circulating NAD levels by 5-6 fold in both controls and patients with mitochondrial myopathy, and also increased NADP levels by 20% in controls.
*   NADP (specifically NADPH) is a crucial cofactor for the conversion of cholesterol to DHEA. Despite the increase in NAD from niacin, the speaker's DHEA sulfate levels did not improve in the short term, remaining low at 114 micrograms/dL.
*   The next experiment will combine the current niacin dose (600 mg/day) with an additional 1 gram/day of tryptophan to investigate if a combined approach via salvage and de novo pathways can further increase NAD and potentially DHEA sulfate.

## Personal NAD Levels and Supplementation Journey

The speaker's personal NAD levels were tracked from January to July 2023 across seven tests:

*   **Baseline (no supplements):** 25.6 micromolar
*   **NMN (300 mg/day):** 25.3 micromolar (no significant change)
*   **NMN (1000 mg/day):** 39 micromolar (first increase)
*   **Vitamin B6 (approx. 3.5x baseline intake):** 30 micromolar
*   **Vitamin B6 (up to 12x baseline intake over two tests):** Average 26 micromolar (no significant impact)
*   **Grape Seed Powder (source of proanthocyanidins, targeting de novo pathway):** 19.9 micromolar (lowest level recorded)
*   **Niacin (nicotinic acid, 600 mg/day):** 67.4 micromolar (highest level recorded)

The speaker returned to the salvage pathway, specifically using niacin, after previous experiments with the de novo pathway (B6 and grape seed powder) did not yield desired improvements in NAD levels.

## Niacin's Impact on NAD

A study published in 2020 demonstrated niacin's effectiveness in addressing NAD deficiency.
**Study Protocol and Findings:**
*   **Participants:** 10 control subjects and 5 patients with adult-onset mitochondrial myopathy, all with an average age of 50-51 years.
*   **Intervention:** Both groups received 1000 mg/day of niacin.
*   **Duration:** 10-month study, with blood samples for NAD analysis taken at 4 and 10 months.
*   **Results for NAD:** Both groups showed a significant 5-6 fold increase in circulating NAD levels.
*   **Results for NADP:** Niacin also increased NADP (NAD with a phosphate group). In the control group, NADP levels significantly increased by 20%.

## Niacin's Broader Impact: NADP and DHEA Synthesis

NADP is critical because its reduced form, NADPH, is a required cofactor in the synthesis of DHEA from cholesterol.

**Cholesterol to DHEA Sulfate Pathway:**
Cholesterol -> (5 enzymatic steps, requiring **NADPH**) -> DHEA -> (Sulfation) -> DHEA sulfate

DHEA sulfate is the most abundant androgen in men, and its levels decline with aging. Low levels are associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. If NADP is low, the conversion of cholesterol into DHEA can be inefficient, potentially leading to low DHEA sulfate levels.

The speaker's DHEA sulfate levels have declined over time:
*   **2005 (average of 2 tests):** 300 micromolar
*   **Last year (average of 23 tests):** 117 micrograms/dL (considered low for age)
*   **Most recent test (after niacin, with increased NAD):** 114 micrograms/dL (no improvement)

This observation raises a question for future research: will a further increase in NAD eventually lead to an increase in DHEA sulfate? If not, it suggests that NAD is not the limiting factor, and other factors such as cholesterol levels or the sulfation process of DHEA might be at play.

## Future Experiments

The speaker plans to continue investigating NAD levels, focusing on the de novo NAD synthesis pathway in conjunction with niacin.
**Reasoning for the next experiment:**
*   Previous attempts with vitamin B6 (up to 12-fold increase) and grape seed powder (which reduced NAD levels) had no positive effect on NAD, suggesting there might not be age-related blocks in those specific steps of the de novo pathway for the speaker.
*   This leads to the hypothesis that supplementing with tryptophan, the precursor for the de novo pathway, could raise NAD.

**Next NAD Test Protocol:**
*   **Current Tryptophan Intake:** 1 gram per day.
*   **Supplementation:** An additional 1 gram per day of tryptophan.
*   **Niacin Dose:** Unchanged at 600 mg per day.
*   **Goal:** To determine if doubling tryptophan intake alongside niacin can further increase NAD and potentially elevate DHEA sulfate levels.
