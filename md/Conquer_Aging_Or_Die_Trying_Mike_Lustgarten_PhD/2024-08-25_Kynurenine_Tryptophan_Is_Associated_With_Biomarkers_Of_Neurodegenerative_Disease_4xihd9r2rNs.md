# 2024-08-25 Kynurenine Tryptophan Is Associated With Biomarkers Of Neurodegenerative Disease

## Executive Summary
* The Kynurenine to Tryptophan Ratio (KTR) is significantly and positively associated with plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration, including phosphorylated tau (p-tau), Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP), and Neurofilament Light Chain (NFL) protein in older adults.
* The KTR serves as an integrated measure of inflammatory inputs (pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines) and antioxidant defense, as it reflects the activity of Indoleamine Dioxygenase (IDO).
* Under inflammatory conditions (induced by cytokines or LPS), Tryptophan is degraded into Kynurenine via IDO, increasing the KTR.
* The optimal KTR range associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk is between 15 and 23.
* Measuring the KTR may allow for an indirect strategy to track and potentially mitigate plasma biomarkers of neurodegenerative disease by managing inflammation and oxidative stress.

## Neurodegenerative Disease Biomarkers

Plasma biomarkers are crucial for detecting neuropathological hallmarks associated with neurodegenerative conditions:

*   **Amyloid Plaques (Alzheimer's Disease):** Biomarker is the A$\beta$42 / A$\beta$40 ratio in plasma.
*   **Tau Tangles (Alzheimer's, Huntington's):** Biomarker is phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in plasma.
*   **Neuroinflammation:** Biomarker is Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) in plasma.
*   **Neurodegeneration:** Biomarker is Neurofilament Light Chain Protein (NFL) in plasma.

*Note: Direct commercial availability of these plasma biomarkers, particularly the A$\beta$ ratio, is often limited or prohibitively expensive (e.g., >\$1,200 for the A$\beta$ ratio test).*

## Kynurenine to Tryptophan Ratio (KTR) Association with Neurodegeneration

A study involving 178 individuals aged 78 years investigated the association between KTR and established plasma biomarkers:

*   **Methodology:** The study measured plasma levels of p-tau, GFAP, and NFL (X-axis) against the plasma Kynurenine to Tryptophan Ratio (Y-axis).
*   **Finding:** Significant positive associations ($p < 0.05$) were observed for all three biomarkers. A relatively higher KTR was significantly associated with higher levels of plasma neurodegenerative biomarkers.

## The Kynurenine Pathway: Tryptophan Metabolism

The conversion of Tryptophan to Kynurenine is central to immune status:

### 1. Normal Conditions (Non-Immune Activated)
*   **Process:** Tryptophan $\xrightarrow{\text{Tryptophan Dioxygenase (TDO)}}$ Kynurenine
*   **Outcome:** This pathway contributes to *de novo* NAD synthesis (e.g., in the liver).

### 2. Immune Activated/Inflammation Conditions
*   **Inducers:** Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-$\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, TNF-$\alpha$) and bacterial products (Lipopolysaccharide, LPS).
*   **Process:** Inducers lead to the expression of **Indoleamine Dioxygenase (IDO)**.
*   **IDO Function:** Tryptophan $\xrightarrow{\text{IDO}}$ Kynurenine
*   **Result:** Increased degradation of Tryptophan leads to an **increased Kynurenine to Tryptophan Ratio (KTR)**.

### 3. Anti-Inflammatory Regulation
*   **Inhibitors:** Anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-4) and the antioxidant enzyme Superoxide Dismutase (SOD).
*   **Effect:** These factors inhibit IDO-1 expression, tempering the increase in KTR.

**Conclusion:** The KTR functions as an integrated measure reflecting both pro-inflammatory signaling and antioxidant defense capacity.

## Personal KTR Tracking and Optimization

The KTR can be tracked using metabolomics kits that measure plasma Kynurenine and Tryptophan levels.

### Optimal KTR Range (Based on All-Cause Mortality Risk)
*   **Optimal Range (Lowest Risk):** KTR between 15 and 23.
*   **Increased Risk Range:** KTR values greater than 25 are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.

### Personal Data Trend
*   **2023 Average KTR (5 tests):** 24 (Slightly outside the optimal risk range, but below the increased risk threshold).
*   **2024 Average KTR (5 tests to date):** 22.5 (Moved into the optimal 15-23 range).

The goal of tracking the KTR is to maintain low values to minimize inflammation, oxidative stress, and the associated increase in neurodegenerative disease biomarkers during aging.

## Methodological Notes on Data Collection
The speaker noted using at-home metabolomics kits to measure the KTR and other metabolites. The following protocol describes how the speaker tracked their personal results over time:

*   **Data Collection Protocol:**
    *   Obtain regular plasma tests for Kynurenine and Tryptophan (e.g., via IOLO's kit).
    *   Calculate the Kynurenine to Tryptophan Ratio (KTR) for each time point.
    *   Plot the KTR against time to monitor longitudinal changes.
