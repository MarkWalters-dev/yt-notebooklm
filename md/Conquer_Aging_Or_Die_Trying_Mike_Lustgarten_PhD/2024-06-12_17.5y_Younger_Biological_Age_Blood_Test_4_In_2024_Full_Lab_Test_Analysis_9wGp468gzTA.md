# 2024-06-12 17.5y Younger Biological Age Blood Test 4 In 2024 Full Lab Test Analysis

## Executive Summary

*   Biological Age (PhenoAge) calculated at 33.8 years, which is 17.5 years younger than the chronological age of 51.3 years. This result, consistent with recent trends, suggests a potential slowing of biological aging since 2018.
*   A significant and statistically confirmed improvement in HDL levels was observed, averaging 55 mg/dL over the last nine tests compared to approximately 45 mg/dL in 43 previous tests since 2015.
*   Indicators suggest improved kidney function, with creatinine levels near their lowest observed value and uric acid also at its lowest end among all tests.
*   Lymphocyte count has recently declined to below 1,500 cells/uL (from a historical and more youthful 2,000 cells/uL), indicating a shift in an unfavorable direction concerning aging.
*   Experimental interventions, including a 5g/day BCAA supplement to lower homocysteine and increased Brazil nut intake for selenium to improve the Free T3 to Free T4 ratio, showed no significant impact on respective biomarkers in this test.

## Biological Age Assessment

This marks the fourth blood test in 2024 and the 52nd since 2015. Using Dr. Morgan Levine's PhenoAge calculator, a biological age of 33.8 years was determined, which is 17.5 years younger than the chronological age of 51.3 years.

*   **Note on CRP:** The C-reactive protein (CRP) value used for this calculation was imputed. The standard CRP test measures levels less than 3 mg/L, which does not provide the specificity of an HS-CRP test (lower limit of detection 0.3 mg/L). Based on 17 previous tests showing HS-CRP levels below 0.3 mg/L, a value of 0.3 mg/L was assumed. If the actual HS-CRP were higher, it could slightly reduce the calculated biological age advantage.

### Biological Age Trends (2018-2024)

Analysis of 33 PhenoAge tests since 2018 reveals the following trends:

*   **2018-2019 (3 tests):** Average biological age of 36.1 years.
*   **2020-2021 (12 tests, 6 each year):** Average biological age of 35.6 years for both years.
*   **2022 (Best Year):** Average biological age of 33.8 years.
*   **2023:** Average biological age of 34.7 years.
*   **2024 (First 4 tests):** Average biological age of 33.7 years, pushing towards the lowest recorded data.

While a claim of "aging reversal" is not made, the consistent data since 2018 suggests a potential slowing of biological aging through this approach.

## Full Blood Test Report Analysis

### Hormones: Testosterone & SHBG

*   **Total Testosterone:** 965 ng/dL, considered youthful.
*   **Free Testosterone:** On the relatively low side, towards the lower end of the range. This is primarily attributed to high Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) levels, which are almost three times higher than the reference range.
*   **SHBG Duality:** SHBG is a complex biomarker:
    *   It increases with aging and higher levels are associated with increased Alzheimer's disease risk.
    *   Conversely, it is approximately two times higher in individuals on calorie restriction (CR) diets compared to standard diets and is positively associated with insulin sensitivity. High SHBG levels may therefore be considered beneficial, especially given that calorie restriction is a gold standard for lifespan extension in various animal models.

### Lipid Profile: HDL

*   **HDL:** 54 mg/dL. The optimal range for HDL is 50-60 mg/dL.
*   **Historical Improvement:** Previously, there were issues with relatively low HDL levels. However, for the last nine consecutive tests (approximately 15 months), HDL has been ≥ 50 mg/dL, with an average of about 55 mg/dL. This contrasts with an average of approximately 45 mg/dL for the 43 tests conducted since 2015. A two-sample t-test confirms a statistically significant improvement in HDL over the recent period.

### Homocysteine

*   **Homocysteine:** 10.8 micromolar, which is considered "age-expected." The goal is to achieve youthful levels.
*   **BCAA Intervention Protocol:**
    1.  **Hypothesis:** Increasing protein intake, specifically Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs), would lower homocysteine, building on a personal data correlation between higher protein intake and lower homocysteine.
    2.  **Rationale:** Data from a Parkinson's animal model suggests BCAA fermentation by gut bacteria can reduce neurodegeneration, potentially by lowering homocysteine. This intervention aimed to address a potential deficiency in BCAAs or limitation in gut bacterial fermentation into propionate.
    3.  **Intervention:** Supplemented with 5 grams of BCAAs per day, representing a 50% increase relative to average intake.
    4.  **Result:** No impact on homocysteine levels observed from this intervention.

### Glucose, Creatinine, & Uric Acid (Kidney Function)

*   **Glucose:** The glucose level for this test was the second-worst among all 52 tests since 2015. An objective is to reduce this in future tests.
*   **Creatinine:** Close to its lowest value, which is positive as creatinine levels typically increase with aging. A lower creatinine, in this context (unlikely muscle mass loss in a month), suggests improved kidney function.
*   **Uric Acid:** Also close to its lowest value across all tests. Uric acid levels increase with poor kidney function.
*   **Conclusion:** The concurrent reduction in creatinine and uric acid levels suggests improved systemic clearance and better kidney function for this test.

### Thyroid Hormones: Free T3 & Free T4 Ratio

*   **Free T3 to Free T4 Ratio:** This ratio remains slightly lower than desired.
*   **Selenium/Brazil Nut Intervention Protocol:**
    1.  **Hypothesis:** Increasing dietary selenium intake would improve the Free T3 to Free T4 ratio.
    2.  **Rationale:** Selenium is a required cofactor for the conversion of T4 into T3.
    3.  **Intervention:** Increased Brazil nut intake to achieve close to the tolerable upper limit of 400 micrograms of selenium per day. The intervention lasted for 16 days prior to this test.
    4.  **Result:** Free T3 marginally increased from 2.3 to 2.4 pg/mL, while Free T4 remained unchanged compared to the previous month's test. This resulted in a very marginal increase in the Free T3 to Free T4 ratio.
*   **Biological Process:** Dietary Selenium -> Cofactor for T4 -> T3 conversion.

### White Blood Cell Count & Distribution

*   **Total White Blood Cell Count (WBC):** 3.6 x 10^3/uL, which is towards the lower end of the range. WBC counts in the 3.5-6.0 x 10^3/uL range are associated with longer life expectancy.
*   **Importance of Distribution:** Focusing solely on total WBC count can be misleading. It's crucial to examine the distribution of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes, which comprise over 95% of total WBCs.
    *   Neutrophils and monocytes generally increase during aging.
    *   Lymphocytes generally decrease during aging.
*   **Lymphocyte Trend:** Historically, lymphocyte counts were around a youthful 2,000 cells/uL (associated with lowest all-cause mortality risk). However, for the past few tests, they have been closer to 1,500 cells/uL or less. This decline indicates a shift in an unfavorable direction for aging and is a priority for future optimization.
*   **Lymphocyte Percentage:** While lymphocyte percentage may appear youthful on age-related plots, it's critical to look at the absolute lymphocyte count and the overall WBC distribution for a comprehensive understanding, as focusing only on percentages or total counts can obscure underlying declines in specific cell types.

### C-Reactive Protein (CRP)

*   The C-Reactive Protein (CRP) measured was not the high-sensitivity CRP (HS-CRP). The standard CRP test has a lower limit of detection of 3 mg/L, making it less precise for assessing very low inflammatory states compared to HS-CRP (lower limit of detection 0.3 mg/L).

### DHEA Sulfate

*   **DHEA Sulfate:** Remains a "weak spot." Although levels have been kept relatively stable for the past few years (which is good, as DHEA-S declines with aging), they were approximately twice as high 15 years ago. The goal is to restore DHEA-S levels to these past higher values.
