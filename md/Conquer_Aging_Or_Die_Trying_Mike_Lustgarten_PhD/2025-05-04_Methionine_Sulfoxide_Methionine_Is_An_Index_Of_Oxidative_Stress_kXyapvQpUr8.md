# 2025-05-04 Methionine Sulfoxide Methionine Is An Index Of Oxidative Stress

## Executive Summary

*   The ratio of methionine sulfoxide to methionine serves as a reliable biomarker for oxidative stress.
*   A higher methionine sulfoxide to methionine ratio is significantly correlated with older biological age.
*   In the provided personal data, the methionine sulfoxide to methionine ratio showed a trend towards increasing between 2023 and 2024, but the first test in 2025 indicated a lower ratio.
*   Avoiding age-related increases in this ratio, aiming for the lower end of one's range, is suggested as a strategy to mitigate oxidative stress.

## Oxidative Stress and the Methionine Sulfoxide to Methionine Ratio

Methionine, an amino acid, undergoes oxidation of its sulfur atom in the presence of reactive oxygen species, specifically hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), to form methionine sulfoxide. The ratio of methionine sulfoxide to methionine is therefore an index of oxidative stress.

## Correlation with Biological Age

The methionine sulfoxide to methionine ratio has been shown to be associated with biological age. In the presented data, plotting the PhenoAge biological age calculator against this ratio revealed a significant positive correlation.

*   **Correlation Coefficient (r):** 0.79
*   **P-value:** < 0.05 (0.006)

A correlation coefficient of 0.79 indicates a strong positive association, meaning that a higher methionine sulfoxide to methionine ratio is significantly correlated with an older biological age.

## Personal Data: Methionine Sulfoxide to Methionine Ratio Over Time

Personal data tracking the methionine sulfoxide to methionine ratio over 15 tests from 2023 to 2025 shows the following trends:

*   **2023 (5 tests):** Average ratio of 0.06
*   **2024 (9 tests):** Average ratio of 0.07

While this indicates a movement in a potentially unfavorable direction, a two-sample t-test comparing 2023 and 2024 data did not show a statistically significant difference (p-value > 0.05, specifically 0.32).

The first blood test in 2025 indicated a lower ratio, falling on the lower side of the observed range, suggesting a potential positive shift.

## Optimal Ratio and Considerations

Given that oxidative stress increases with aging, an optimal methionine sulfoxide to methionine ratio would ideally involve:

*   Avoiding age-related increases in the ratio.
*   Maintaining the ratio consistently at the lower end of one's individual range.

The exact optimal numerical value (e.g., 0.04 or 0.08) is not definitively established, but avoiding increases year-to-year is a key consideration.

## Other Biomarkers of Oxidative Stress

Other metabolomic ratios can also be used to evaluate oxidative stress, including:

*   Cysteine / Cysteine
*   Xanthine / Hypoxanthine

These will likely be covered in future discussions.
