# 2024-03-14 Ergothioneine Extends Lifespan In Worms Flies And Mice - What About In People

## Executive Summary

*   Ergothioneine supplementation in mice at seven weeks of age resulted in a 16% increase in median survival and a 29% increase in maximal survival.
*   Higher doses of ergothioneine (10 millimolar) significantly increased lifespan in *C. elegans* (worms).
*   Ergothioneine has previously been shown to extend lifespan in flies.
*   Higher plasma levels of ergothioneine in humans were associated with a reduced risk of death from all causes.

## Mouse Data

Ergothioneine supplementation was initiated in young mice (seven weeks of age) at a dose of 4-5 mg/kg body weight.

*   **Median Survival:** A 16% increase in median survival was observed in ergothioneine-supplemented mice compared to controls.
*   **Maximal Survival:** A 29% increase in maximal survival was observed in ergothioneine-supplemented mice compared to controls.

## Worm Data (*C. elegans*)

*   **Low Dose (5 millimolar):** The lifespan curve shifted in the right direction, but the effect was not statistically significant.
*   **High Dose (10 millimolar):** Ergothioneine significantly increased lifespan in *C. elegans*.

## Fly Data

Ergothioneine has been shown to extend lifespan in flies.

## Human Evidence

A study involving individuals with an average age of 58 years and a 22-year follow-up investigated the association between plasma metabolite levels and all-cause mortality risk.

*   **Methodology:** Baseline plasma metabolite levels were assessed, and the risk of death was evaluated approximately 22 years later.
*   **Hazard Ratio Interpretation:**
    *   A log hazard ratio to the right of zero indicates a relatively higher plasma level of a metabolite is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   A log hazard ratio to the left of zero indicates a relatively higher plasma level of a metabolite is associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Findings:**
    *   **Cotinine:** This marker of tobacco use was furthest to the right of the log hazard ratio of zero, indicating a maximally increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Ergothioneine:** This metabolite was farthest to the left of the log hazard ratio of zero, indicating that relatively higher plasma levels of ergothioneine are associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk.

## Ergothioneine Metabolism and Measurement

*   Ergothioneine can be influenced by diet and also degraded by gut bacteria.
*   Measuring plasma levels is considered essential for assessing its impact.
*   At-home metabolomics kits are becoming available to track plasma ergothioneine levels, with an update expected for May 2024.
