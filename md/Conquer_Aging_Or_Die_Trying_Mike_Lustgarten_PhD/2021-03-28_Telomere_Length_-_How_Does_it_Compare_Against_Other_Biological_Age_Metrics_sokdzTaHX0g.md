# 2021-03-28 Telomere Length - How Does it Compare Against Other Biological Age Metrics

## Executive Summary

*   Telomere length declines with chronological age, but its correlation with chronological age is moderate (r = -0.42).
*   Shorter telomeres are associated with a 26% increased risk of all-cause mortality, though this association was not significant in 13 out of 23 studies examined.
*   Other biological age metrics, such as the kdm biological age (incorporating 12 biomarkers), show a much stronger correlation with chronological age (r = 0.91) compared to telomere length.
*   In one study, telomere length was not significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk, whereas several epigenetic clocks and other metrics like cognitive function, functional aging index (FAI), and frailty index (FI) were.
*   When assessing health span-related metrics, telomere shortness was only significantly correlated with facial aging, while certain epigenetic clocks and kdm biological age showed broader significant correlations with physical function, cognitive function, and subjective aging measures.

## Telomere Biology Overview

*   Telomeres are protective caps at the ends of chromosomes.
*   During cell division and replication, telomeres shorten.
*   Critically short telomeres are associated with cellular senescence.
*   Telomeres protect chromosomes from fusion and maintain chromosomal stability.
*   Telomere length declines during aging.
*   Shorter telomeres are associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality.

## Telomere Length and Aging

### Data on Telomere Length Decline

*   Telomere length (measured in white blood cells, LTL) declines with increasing chronological age in both females and males.
*   This data is representative of cohorts from European countries, the US, and Israel.

### Association with All-Cause Mortality Risk

*   A meta-analysis of 23 studies (over 120,000 subjects) examined the association between shorter telomeres and all-cause mortality risk.
*   Findings indicated a 26% increased risk of death for all causes in individuals with shorter telomeres compared to those with longer telomeres.
*   **Caveat:** In 13 out of the 23 studies, the effect of telomere length on all-cause mortality risk was not statistically significant.

### Correlation with Chronological Age

*   In a separate study, telomere length plotted against chronological age showed a negative correlation coefficient (r) of -0.42.
*   This indicates a moderate correlation, which is not considered strong (typically considered |r| > 0.5).

## Comparison with Other Biological Age Metrics

### kdm Biological Age

*   The kdm biological age metric incorporates 12 biomarkers: 11 blood biomarkers and systolic blood pressure.
*   Eight of these biomarkers (albumin, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, c-reactive protein, lymphocyte percentage, white blood cell count, MCV, and RDW) are also found in Levine's phenotypic age calculator.
*   **Strong Correlation with Chronological Age:** The kdm biological age metric demonstrated a strong correlation with chronological age, with a correlation coefficient of 0.91. This is significantly stronger than the correlation observed for telomere length.

### Association with All-Cause Mortality Risk

*   A study compared telomere length with eight other biological age metrics regarding their association with all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Telomere Length:** Was *not* significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk in this study.
*   **Epigenetic Age Clocks:**
    *   Horvath's initial epigenetic clock: Not significantly associated.
    *   Hannum epigenetic clock: Not significantly associated.
    *   DNAmPhenoAge (Levine's clock): Significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality risk (older epigenetic age correlated with higher risk).
    *   DNA GrimAge (Horvath's clock): Significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality risk (older epigenetic age correlated with higher risk).
*   **Other Metrics:**
    *   Cognitive function: Better cognitive function was associated with a lower hazard ratio for all-cause mortality.
    *   Functional Aging Index (FAI): Significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk.
    *   Frailty Index (FI): Significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Conclusion:** Six out of nine measures were significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk, while telomere length was not.

### Physiological Age Metric

*   A "physiological age" metric, including blood biomarkers (hemoglobin, glucose, cholesterol, apoB, triglycerides) and clinical markers (BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, waist circumference, hip circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure), was also assessed.
*   Similar to telomere length, this physiological age metric was *not* associated with all-cause mortality risk in this particular study.

### Health Span-Related Metrics

*   A study compared telomere shortness with epigenetic clocks and kdm biological age in relation to health span-related metrics (physical function, balance, grip strength, motor coordination, physical limitations, cognitive function, cognitive decline, self-rated health, facial aging).
*   **Telomere Shortness:** Only significantly correlated with facial aging (r, p-value provided).
*   **Epigenetic Clocks (353 CpG and 99 CpG):** None of the health span-related measures were associated with these two clocks.
*   **Epigenetic Clock (71 CpG):** Significantly correlated with all measures of physical function, cognitive function, and subjective aging, *except for grip strength*.
*   **kdm Biological Age (10 biomarkers):** Significantly correlated with all measures of physical function, cognitive function, and subjective aging.

## Conclusion on Metric Comparison

*   When comparing telomere length to other biological age metrics, kdm biological age and certain epigenetic clocks appear to be stronger indicators for assessing chronological age and health span-related metrics.
*   Telomere length's association with all-cause mortality risk is less consistent and often not statistically significant compared to other measures.
