# 2023-08-06 Tryptophan + Niacin - No Additive Effect On NAD Relative To Niacin Alone

## Executive Summary

*   Supplementation with nicotinic acid (niacin) alone achieved a high NAD level of 67 micromolar.
*   A subsequent test combining niacin with tryptophan did not result in an additive increase in NAD levels, remaining at 59 micromolar.
*   The combined intake of 862 mg/day of nicotinic acid and 688 mg/day of tryptophan over 16 days, with a 10-day lead-in of 1g/day of tryptophan and 659 mg/day of nicotinic acid, showed no improvement compared to niacin alone.
*   This suggests that tryptophan did not further enhance NAD levels when co-administered with a sufficient dose of niacin.
*   Future experiments will investigate the effect of tryptophan supplementation on NAD levels independently of niacin.

## Human Evidence: NAD Levels

### NAD Test #7 (Niacin Alone)

*   Supplementation: 654 mg/day of nicotinic acid (NA)
*   Resulting NAD level: 67 micromolar

### NAD Test #8 (Niacin + Tryptophan)

*   **Supplementation Period (July 5 - July 20, 16 days):**
    *   Average Nicotinic Acid intake: 862 mg/day
    *   Average Tryptophan intake: 688 mg/day
*   **Lead-in Period (10 days prior to test):**
    *   Tryptophan intake: 1 gram/day
    *   Nicotinic Acid intake: 659 mg/day
*   Resulting NAD level: 59 micromolar
*   **Finding:** No additive effect observed for the combination of tryptophan and niacin on NAD levels compared to niacin alone.

## De Novo NAD Synthesis Pathway

Tryptophan can be converted into NAD through a series of enzymatic steps.

Tryptophan -> ... -> NAD

Nicotinic acid (NA) is also converted into NAD.

Nicotinic acid -> ... (3 enzymatic steps) -> NAD

## Future Experiments

*   **Objective:** To determine if tryptophan alone can increase NAD levels.
*   **Rationale:** Previous experiments suggest no age-related block in vitamin B6 or the conversion of quinolinic acid to NAD.
*   **Proposed Protocol:**
    *   Double tryptophan dosage to 2 grams/day.
    *   Total daily tryptophan intake (including diet) of 3 grams/day.
    *   Monitor NAD levels without niacin supplementation.
    *   If no increase is observed, return to niacin supplementation in the range of 600 mg/day.
*   **Next Test Date:** August 21, 2023. A full blood panel will be conducted concurrently.
