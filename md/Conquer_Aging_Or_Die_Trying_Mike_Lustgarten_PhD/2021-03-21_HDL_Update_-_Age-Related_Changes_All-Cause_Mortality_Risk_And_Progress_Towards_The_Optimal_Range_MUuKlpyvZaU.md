# 2021-03-21 HDL Update - Age-Related Changes All-Cause Mortality Risk And Progress Towards The Optimal Range

## Executive Summary

*   A large study of 15.8 million adults shows that HDL levels in women peak at 64 mg/dL between ages 24-27, then consistently decline. In men, HDL peaks at 56 mg/dL between ages 22-23, declines into the mid-30s, then stabilizes around 51-52 mg/dL.
*   The lowest all-cause mortality risk was associated with HDL levels between 50-79 mg/dL for women and 50-59 mg/dL for men. HDL below 50 mg/dL (both sexes) or above 80 mg/dL (women) was linked to significantly increased risk.
*   Individual analysis revealed statistically significant correlations between higher HDL levels and increased intake of certain nuts/seeds (cocoa beans, coconut butter, sunflower seeds, walnuts) and higher daily sodium intake, particularly from pickles.
*   For the individual, a higher HDL level (specifically >50 mg/dL) was strongly and significantly correlated with lower levels of Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP).
*   Elevating HDL above 50 mg/dL is proposed as a beneficial strategy to reduce personal risk for cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, atherosclerosis) and inflammation by lowering Lp(a) and hs-CRP.

## HDL Levels and Age-Related Changes

A study involving 15.8 million adults revealed distinct age-related patterns in HDL cholesterol levels:

*   **Women:** HDL increases during youth, peaking at approximately 64 mg/dL between 24 and 27 years of age. Following this peak, HDL levels consistently decline throughout the rest of life.
*   **Men:** HDL also increases in youth, peaking at 56 mg/dL between 22 and 23 years of age. A decline of about 10 years follows, after which HDL levels stabilize in the low 50s (around 51-52 mg/dL) for the next five decades.

## HDL and All-Cause Mortality Risk - Large Korean Cohort

The large Korean cohort study identified specific HDL ranges associated with all-cause mortality risk:

*   **Lowest Risk:**
    *   **Women:** HDL between 50 and 79 mg/dL.
    *   **Men:** HDL between 50 and 59 mg/dL.
*   **Increased Risk:**
    *   **Both Men and Women:** HDL less than 50 mg/dL was associated with a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Women:** HDL greater than 80 mg/dL also showed a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk when compared with the 50-59 mg/dL range.

## Comparison with Previous Meta-Analysis

These findings were compared to a previous meta-analysis of 24 studies, which included a smaller sample size (3.4 million subjects) from US and European cohorts, contrasting with the Korean cohort. Despite geographical differences and sample size discrepancies, the data showed relative similarities:

*   **Men (Lowest All-Cause Mortality Risk):**
    *   **New Korean Study:** 50-59 mg/dL
    *   **Previous Meta-Analysis:** 52-56 mg/dL
    *   These ranges are quite similar, suggesting consistency independent of geography.
*   **Women (Lowest All-Cause Mortality Risk):**
    *   **New Korean Study:** 50-79 mg/dL
    *   **Previous Meta-Analysis:** 58-62 mg/dL
    *   While the new study showed a wider optimal range, the 50-79 mg/dL grouping still aligns with the lowest risk observed in the meta-analysis.

## Individual Progress Towards Optimal HDL

An individual's HDL levels have been tracked 36 times since 2008, showing a wide range from 28 to 56 mg/dL, with an average of 44 mg/dL over 13 years. Given the optimal range of 50-59 mg/dL identified in the studies, the average value is not optimal.

Recent measurements show progress towards the optimal range, with values moving from 39 to 40, 44, and then 49 mg/dL in the last four measurements. The goal is to identify factors that can consistently maintain HDL above 50 mg/dL.

## Dietary Factors Influencing Individual HDL

Analysis of dietary intake in relation to individual HDL levels revealed several correlations:

*   **Nuts and Seeds:**
    *   Previous data indicated correlations between HDL and saturated fat-containing and/or omega-6 containing nuts/seeds (cocoa beans, coconut butter, sunflower seeds, walnuts).
    *   Initially, only sunflower seeds were significantly correlated with higher HDL. However, the sum of intake of these nuts and seeds showed a strong and statistically significant correlation with higher HDL.
    *   After two more blood tests, the correlation for cocoa beans became statistically significant, and sunflower seeds maintained a strong, significant correlation. Coconut butter's correlation remained similar.
    *   A deliberate reduction in walnut intake resulted in a reduced correlation between walnuts and HDL, indicating a direct influence.
    *   The sum of these four nuts/seeds continues to show a strong, statistically significant correlation (r=0.78) with HDL.
    *   **Strategy:** Maintain and potentially increase intake of these nuts and seeds (currently over 80g/day).

*   **Sodium Intake:**
    *   A statistically significant positive correlation was found between average daily sodium intake and HDL levels; higher sodium intake correlated with higher HDL.
    *   **Major Sodium Sources (in personal diet):** Pickles, carrots, sardines, broccoli, yogurt, beets, and spinach. Processed foods are rarely consumed.
    *   Among these specific foods, **pickles** were the only item independently and significantly correlated with HDL (r=0.75, statistically significant p-value).
    *   **Strategy:** To potentially achieve HDL levels above 50 mg/dL, the individual plans to maintain or increase pickle intake, thereby ensuring total daily sodium intake remains above 2400 mg.

## Clinical Relevance of Increased HDL

Increasing HDL from an average of 44 mg/dL to the 50-59 mg/dL range is considered clinically relevant due to its correlations with other key health markers.

### HDL and Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]

*   **What is Lp(a)?** An LDL-like particle with an apolipoprotein(a) protein in its core.
*   **Risks associated with High Lp(a):** Myocardial infarction (heart attack), ischemic stroke, and atherosclerotic stenosis (atherosclerosis). Higher Lp(a) levels are generally detrimental to health.
*   **Individual Data:**
    *   Over 12 years (19 blood tests), a statistically significant inverse correlation was observed: **Higher HDL -> Lower Lp(a)**.
    *   The individual's average Lp(a) over this period was 38.4 mg/dL.
    *   **Risk Thresholds:**
        *   Increased risk for heart attack and atherosclerosis: Lp(a) > 30 mg/dL. The individual's average is above this, with 18 out of 19 measurements exceeding 30 mg/dL.
        *   Increased risk for stroke: Lp(a) > 50 mg/dL. Only 1 out of 19 measurements exceeded this, though several were in the mid-40s.
    *   **Actionable Insight:** An HDL level greater than 50 mg/dL appeared to be a threshold for achieving Lp(a) levels less than 30 mg/dL. Consistently raising HDL above 50 mg/dL is expected to lower Lp(a) and reduce risks for heart attack and atherosclerosis.

### HDL and High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP)

*   **Correlation:** A moderately strong, statistically significant inverse correlation between HDL and hs-CRP was previously observed and remained consistent across recent blood tests: **Higher HDL -> Lower hs-CRP**.
*   **Optimal hs-CRP:** Levels less than 0.3 mg/L are considered optimal.
*   **Actionable Insight:** Extrapolating from the data, an HDL level greater than 50 mg/dL correlates with achieving an hs-CRP level lower than 0.3 mg/L.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

Based on the evidence from large population studies and individual physiological correlations:

*   The optimal HDL range for reduced all-cause mortality risk for men is 50-59 mg/dL, and for women, 50-79 mg/dL.
*   In the individual case, achieving an HDL level greater than 50 mg/dL is beneficial, aligning with peak HDL levels in youth and optimal mortality risk ranges.
*   This increase is further supported by strong inverse correlations with key cardiovascular risk markers:
    *   Elevated HDL (>50 mg/dL) is associated with reduced Lipoprotein(a), mitigating risks for heart attack and atherosclerosis.
    *   Elevated HDL (>50 mg/dL) is associated with reduced high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, indicating lower systemic inflammation.
*   Dietary strategies, including maintaining or increasing intake of specific nuts/seeds (cocoa beans, coconut butter, sunflower seeds, walnuts) and sodium from sources like pickles, are being utilized to achieve and maintain HDL levels above 50 mg/dL.
