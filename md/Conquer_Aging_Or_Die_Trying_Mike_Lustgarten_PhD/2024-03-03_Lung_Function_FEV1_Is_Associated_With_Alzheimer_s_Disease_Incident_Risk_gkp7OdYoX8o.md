# 2024-03-03 Lung Function FEV1 Is Associated With Alzheimer s Disease Incident Risk

## Executive Summary

*   Higher triglyceride levels are associated with a lower incident risk for Alzheimer's disease.
*   Elevated Mean Cell Volume (MCV) of red blood cells is associated with an increased Alzheimer's disease incident risk, while higher red blood cell count is associated with a lower risk.
*   Redundant Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) is not significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease incident risk.
*   Lower Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1), indicating poorer lung function, is associated with an increased Alzheimer's disease incident risk.
*   The study suggests that tracking FEV1 may be important for assessing Alzheimer's disease risk, alongside other biomarkers like triglycerides and red blood cell count.

## Study Methodology

The study analyzed data from nearly 326,000 individuals with an average age of 56 years, with a nine-year follow-up period to assess Alzheimer's disease incident risk based on baseline biomarker assessments. The analysis included three models:
*   Age and sex adjusted.
*   Multivariate model.
*   Disease-specific model, adjusting for as many factors as possible that could impact the association between blood biomarkers and Alzheimer's disease incident risk.

## Biomarker Associations with Alzheimer's Disease Incident Risk

### Metabolic Biomarkers

*   **Serum Glucose:** Not associated with Alzheimer's disease incident risk.
*   **Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c):** Not associated with Alzheimer's disease incident risk.
*   **Total Cholesterol:** Borderline significant; higher levels were associated with a lower incident risk.
*   **Triglycerides:** Higher triglyceride levels were associated with a lower Alzheimer's disease incident risk.

### Inflammation and Organ Function Biomarkers

*   **C-Reactive Protein (CRP):** Not associated with Alzheimer's disease incident risk.
*   **Albumin:** Not significantly associated.
*   **Alkaline Phosphatase:** Not significantly associated.
*   **Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN):** Not significantly associated.
*   **Creatinine:** Not significantly associated.
*   **Uric Acid:** Not significantly associated.

### Hematological Biomarkers

*   **Lymphocytes:** Not significantly associated.
*   **Red Blood Cells (Total Levels/Count):** Higher red blood cell levels were associated with a lower Alzheimer's disease incident risk.
*   **Mean Cell Volume (MCV):** Higher MCV was associated with an increased Alzheimer's disease incident risk.
*   **Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW):** Not significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease incident risk.

### Other Biomarkers

*   **Systolic Blood Pressure:** Not associated with Alzheimer's disease incident risk.
*   **Diastolic Blood Pressure:** Not associated with Alzheimer's disease incident risk.
*   **Waist Circumference:** Not associated with Alzheimer's disease incident risk.

## Lung Function Biomarker

### Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1)

*   **Association:** Higher FEV1 levels (better lung function) were associated with a lower Alzheimer's disease incident risk.
*   **Age-Related Decline:** FEV1 typically peaks around age 20 and declines with age. This decline is observable in both men and women, even when considering healthy non-smokers.
*   **Tracking FEV1:** Home-based spirometers can reliably track FEV1 with high correlation to physician-office spirometry, allowing for self-monitoring.
*   **Personal Data:** The presenter has been tracking their FEV1 since September 2022, taking the best of nine trials for each measurement, typically three days per week between 9-10 PM.
    *   An attempt to increase FEV1 using a lung-specific trainer initially led to a reduction, likely due to overtraining.
    *   Upon stopping the trainer, FEV1 began to increase.
    *   Average FEV1 in 2023 was 3.25 liters/second.
    *   Average FEV1 in early 2024 (so far) is 3.38 liters/second.
*   **Comparison to Age-Expected FEV1:** At age 51, the presenter's age-expected FEV1 is 2.95 liters. Their 2023 average of 3.25 liters/second corresponds to the median value for someone 10-11 years younger.
*   **Goal:** To avoid age-related decline in FEV1 and to use data to guide the reintroduction and optimization of lung-specific training if a decline is observed over several weeks.
