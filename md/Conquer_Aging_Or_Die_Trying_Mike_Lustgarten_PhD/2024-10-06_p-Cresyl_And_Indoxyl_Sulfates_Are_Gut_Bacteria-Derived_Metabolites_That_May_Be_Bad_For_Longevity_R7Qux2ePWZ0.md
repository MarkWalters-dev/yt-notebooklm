# 2024-10-06 p-Cresyl And Indoxyl Sulfates Are Gut Bacteria-Derived Metabolites That May Be Bad For Longevity

## Executive Summary
*   p-Cresyl sulfate (PCS) and indoxyl sulfate (IS) are metabolites produced by gut bacteria from tyrosine and tryptophan, respectively.
*   These metabolites are detoxified by the liver through sulfation, but elevated levels in circulation can damage the kidney, heart, and endothelium.
*   Circulating levels of PCS and IS increase with age due to declining kidney function and potentially decreased albumin binding.
*   Higher levels of PCS and IS are significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality.
*   Dietary factors, such as macadamia nuts, mushrooms, vitamin B5, and coconut butter, show correlations with PCS and IS levels, suggesting potential avenues for intervention.

## Gut Microbiome Metabolism to PCS and IS
Proteins in the large intestine are broken down into amino acids:
*   Tyrosine -> Paracresol (by gut bacteria)
*   Tryptophan -> Indole (by gut bacteria)

Indole can be converted to indoxyl under oxidative conditions.

These compounds can enter the bloodstream via the portal circulation, reaching the liver.

## Liver Detoxification and Circulation
The liver attempts to detoxify paracresol and indole by adding sulfate groups, forming:
*   p-Cresyl sulfate (PCS)
*   Indoxyl sulfate (IS)

One mechanism to reduce circulating levels is binding to albumin.

## Factors Affecting Circulating Levels
*   **Aging:**
    *   Albumin levels decline, reducing the binding capacity for PCS and IS, thus increasing free levels.
    *   Kidney function declines, impairing the clearance of these metabolites.
*   **Consequence of Aging:** Elevated levels of PCS and IS accumulate during aging.

## Evidence of Age-Related Increases in PCS and IS
Data shows statistically significant increases in circulating levels of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate in individuals older than 65 compared to those younger than 65.

*   **Indoxyl Sulfate:** Increased from 1.22 µM to 1.55 µM (p < 0.05).
*   **p-Cresyl Sulfate:** Increased from 3.83 µM to 4.9 µM (p < 0.05).

## Association with All-Cause Mortality
Both PCS and IS are significantly associated with an increased risk of death from all causes.

*   **Tyrosine-derived compounds (PCS):** Hazard ratio significantly greater than 1, with the 95% confidence interval entirely to the right of 1.
*   **Tryptophan-derived compounds (IS):** Hazard ratio significantly greater than 1, with the 95% confidence interval entirely to the right of 1.

## Personal Metabolomics Data and Trends
Personal tracking of plasma levels of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate over an 14-month period (April 2023 - July 2024) reveals a trend line moving in the "wrong direction," indicating increasing levels.

## Dietary Correlations with PCS and IS
Analysis of correlations between dietary intake and metabolite levels (p < 0.05) reveals several associations:

*   **Positive Correlation (Higher intake associated with higher metabolite levels):**
    *   Macadamia nuts

*   **Inverse Correlation (Higher intake associated with lower metabolite levels):**
    *   Mushrooms (rich source of Vitamin B5)
    *   Vitamin B5 (likely a marker for mushroom intake)
    *   Coconut butter

## The Coconut Butter Conundrum
Coconut butter presents a conflicting correlation:
*   **Metabolite Levels:** Inversely correlated with PCS and IS, suggesting higher intake may be beneficial for these markers.
*   **Epigenetic Age (Horvath's Clock):** Inversely correlated with Horvath's epigenetic age, suggesting higher intake is associated with a *younger* epigenetic age.
*   **Telomere Length:** Positively correlated with telomere length, suggesting higher intake is associated with *longer* telomeres.

This creates a dilemma: prioritize improving metabolite levels associated with mortality or potentially negative epigenetic markers, or vice versa. The current preference is to favor metabolomic markers.
