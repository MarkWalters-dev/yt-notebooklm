# 2021-07-14 Lifespan Extension In Drosophila - A Conversation with Dr. Michael Rose

## Executive Summary

*   Experimental evolution in *Drosophila* by selectively breeding from older adults can lead to significant lifespan extension, potentially doubling lifespan in approximately 80 generations.
*   Aging is not an uncontrollable process of molecular damage but rather an adaptation that can be tuned by natural selection, involving hundreds of genes, transcripts, and metabolites.
*   Translating lifespan extension findings from *Drosophila* to humans is complex and requires sophisticated approaches beyond simple supplementation or drug interventions, likely involving a combination of machine learning, omics data, and large-scale resources.
*   The future of aging interventions lies in a holistic, multi-omic, and AI-driven approach, potentially involving large consortiums and corporate-scale resources, rather than reductionist single-gene or single-supplement strategies.
*   Dietary and lifestyle interventions, particularly those aligned with ancestral evolutionary history, can be effective, but achieving dramatic lifespan extension requires a comprehensive, data-driven strategy.

## Experimental Evolution and Lifespan Extension in *Drosophila*

*   **Early Experiments (1970s):** Dr. Michael Rose replicated experiments by Watier (1977) who bred flies exclusively from older adults in two *Drosophila* species (*subobscura* and *pseudoobscura*). This resulted in increased lifespan.
*   **Hypothesis:** Modifying the first stage of reproduction (delayed reproduction) would, over time, lead to populations evolving delayed aging, supported by evolutionary genetic theory.
*   **Systematic Approach (1980 onwards):**
    *   Five *Drosophila* populations were established with delayed reproduction, alongside five control populations.
    *   These populations have been maintained and studied for decades.
*   **Magnitude of Lifespan Extension:**
    *   Experimental evolution using delayed reproduction demonstrated lifespan extension not by a small margin (10-20%), but by multiples (two, three, and even five times).
    *   A doubling of lifespan was observed in approximately 80 generations.
*   **Reversibility:** The procedure can be reversed; taking long-lived lines and shortening the reproductive cycle leads to rapid evolution of shorter lifespans.
*   **Genetic Complexity:** The genomic basis for this tuning involves hundreds of sites in the genome, affecting hundreds of transcript levels, which in turn influences hundreds of metabolites and consequently, organ systems.

## Transitioning to Human Interventions: Beyond Experimental Evolution

*   **Timeframe for Human Application:** Extrapolating the 80 generations for a 2x lifespan extension in *Drosophila* to human years suggests impractical timescales (thousands of years).
*   **Developing Faster Methods:** Since 1984, the focus has shifted to developing faster intervention strategies that do not involve experimental evolution.
*   **Layered Supplementation Approach (Genescient Era):**
    *   An idea published around 2010 involved a layered supplementation approach, guided by omics data from fruit flies, and bridged to human interventions.
    *   This approach influenced the founding of the company Genescient.
*   **Lyceum Company:** Founded by Dr. Rose, based on a different intervention strategy.
*   **AI and Machine Learning for Bridging Omics:**
    *   Since 2010, there has been a focus on using AI, specifically machine learning, to bridge the gap from fruit fly genomes to human genomes and from omic effects to clinical efficacy in humans.
    *   Key publications include:
        *   2017: Large-scale genomics paper.
        *   2018: AI methodology paper (FLAIM) by Moore et al.
        *   2019: Transcriptomics paper.
        *   Ongoing work on metabolomics.
*   **Complexity of Aging:** The genetic foundations of adaptation and aging are complex, involving hundreds of genes, transcripts, and metabolites.
*   **Machine Learning for Parsing Complexity:** Machine learning tools are essential for navigating and understanding this complexity, both for scientific inference and technological intervention.

## The Role of Machine Learning and Omics in Aging Research

*   **Beyond Reductionism:** The traditional reductionist approach in biology is becoming obsolete for complex issues like aging, which involve a vast network of interacting factors.
*   **Genomics and Omics Revolution:** The advent of genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic technologies has revealed the inherent complexity of biological systems, challenging reductionist paradigms.
*   **AI-Driven Interventions:** Machine learning is crucial for processing massive omics datasets and identifying actionable interventions.
*   **Ubiquity of Machine Learning:** Machine learning is already integrated into daily life (e.g., Google Search, Amazon), and its application in biology is a natural progression.
*   **Challenges in Translating to Individuals:** While machine learning can identify potential interventions in large cohorts, developing personalized recommendations for individuals based on their unique genetics and environment is a significant ongoing challenge.
*   **Need for Pharma-Scale Resources:** Developing effective interventions that translate omic insights into health and lifespan benefits likely requires the resources of pharmaceutical companies and large healthcare providers.

## Diet, Lifestyle, and Ancestry

*   **Age and Ancestry-Appropriate Tuning:** A short-term bridge to lifespan extension is tuning diet and lifestyle based on evolutionary history.
*   **Dietary Adaptation:**
    *   Populations with ancestry from the Northwestern Periphery of Eurasia may be less adapted to modern agricultural foods than those from the Middle East or South Asia.
    *   As humans age, adaptation to agricultural foods can decrease, making them less beneficial or even detrimental.
    *   Foods novel to the human diet since 1850 (e.g., processed seed oils, trans fats, nitrites) are generally not adapted to and can be toxic.
*   **Long Abandoned Diets:** Experiments with *Drosophila* suggest that diets not consumed for many generations can be more beneficial at later ages than recently evolved "agricultural" diets.
*   **Key Dietary Recommendations (for some ancestries):** Reducing or eliminating grains, rice, corn, dairy from mammals, and legumes can improve health.

## The Future of Aging Interventions

*   **Holistic Approach:** The future of aging interventions lies in a holistic, multi-omic approach that considers the complex interplay of genes, transcripts, metabolites, and microbiomes.
*   **Machine Learning as a Tool:** Machine learning is essential for parsing this complexity and identifying causal pathways, not just correlates.
*   **"Amazon Scale" Resources:** Achieving significant lifespan extension will likely require corporate-scale resources, comparable to the development of Amazon or the Apollo missions.
*   **Consortium Approach:** Large-scale interventions will probably be driven by consortia of big companies, rather than individual researchers or small startups.
*   **Moving Beyond Reductionism:** The field needs to move away from simplistic stories about single genes or pathways and embrace the reality of biological complexity.
*   **Measuring Success:** The focus should shift from maximum lifespan to age-specific mortality rates and functional measures, which can be assessed over shorter timeframes.
*   **Microbiome's Role:** The microbiome plays a significant role in aging and lifespan, and future interventions must account for the coevolutionary adaptation of microbes.
*   **The Long Game:** Achieving dramatic lifespan extension is a difficult but doable task that requires sustained effort, significant resources, and a deep appreciation for biological complexity.
