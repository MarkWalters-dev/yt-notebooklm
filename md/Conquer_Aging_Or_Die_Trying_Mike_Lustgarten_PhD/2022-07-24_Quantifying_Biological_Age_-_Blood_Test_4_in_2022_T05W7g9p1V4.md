# 2022-07-24 Quantifying Biological Age - Blood Test 4 in 2022

## Executive Summary

*   The subject's biological age, calculated by Levine's PhenoAge, was 32.2 years (17.2 years younger than chronological age) based on 07/11/2022 blood test data, incorporating refined high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) from at-home testing.
*   At-home finger-prick testing for hs-CRP showed comparable or superior sensitivity (<0.2 mg/L) to standard lab venipuncture (<0.3 mg/L).
*   Longitudinal data for Levine's PhenoAge shows a reduction in average biological age from 35.6 years (2020-2021) to 33.9 years (2022), with an increased average age reduction from chronological age (11.9 years pre-2022 to 15.2 years in 2022).
*   Using the Aging.ai model, the subject's biological age was 28 years (21.4 years younger than chronological age) for the latest test, continuing a trend of reduction from previous periods (e.g., 32 years in 2009-2013, 29.9 years in 2016-2021).

## Biological Age Measurement (Levine PhenoAge)

Aging and disease are biochemical processes that unfold over decades. Tracking established biomarkers of organ and systemic health can provide insight into the potential to slow aging and disease risk. Earlier this month, the fourth blood test of 2022 was conducted to assess biological age.

Biological age was calculated using Dr. Morgan Levine's phenotypic age calculator (PhenoAge). The blood test performed on 07/11/2022, using nine biomarkers and chronological age, calculated a biological age of 32.6 years, which is 16.8 years younger than chronological age.

The Quest Lab's high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) measurement was reported as <0.3 mg/L, indicating it was below their detection limit. The actual value could range from zero to 0.3 mg/L.

## Comparison of hs-CRP Testing Methods

At-home blood biomarker testing offers advantages in convenience and frequency of data collection. While approximately 40 blood tests were conducted over the past seven years (averaging five tests per year) via lab venipuncture, at-home finger-prick testing allows for similar data collection (e.g., 40 tests) in a shorter timeframe (e.g., six weeks).

An at-home high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) test (Let's Get Checked) was performed to compare its accuracy against standard lab venipuncture.

### Methodology:

*   Quest Lab venipuncture blood draw: ~07:30 AM.
*   At-home finger-prick test: ~08:30 AM (approximately one hour after venipuncture).
*   Both tests were conducted in a fasted state.

The primary question was whether the at-home finger-prick test, involving blood squeezed onto a blood spot card, would yield comparable hs-CRP data to the venipuncture method.

The at-home hs-CRP test reported a value of <0.2 mg/L. This indicates a slightly better sensitivity for the at-home test compared to the Quest Lab's <0.3 mg/L result. The at-home test confirmed hs-CRP was below the 0.3 mg/L threshold, supporting its reliability relative to venipuncture for this measurement. If the at-home test had yielded an hs-CRP value higher than 0.3 mg/L, its reliability would be questionable in comparison to venipuncture.

## Refined Levine PhenoAge Calculation

Using the more precise hs-CRP value of <0.2 mg/L from the at-home test (as an upper limit), the Levine PhenoAge was re-calculated. This resulted in a further reduced biological age of 32.2 years, which is 17.2 years younger than chronological age.

## Longitudinal Levine PhenoAge Trends

Longitudinal analysis of Levine PhenoAge results since 2020 provides further context:

*   **2020 (6 tests):** Average biological age = 35.6 years.
*   **2021 (6 tests):** Average biological age = 35.6 years.
*   **2022 (first 4 tests):** Average biological age = 33.9 years.

This represents a positive reduction in average biological age for 2022 compared to previous years.

The average biological age reduction relative to chronological age has also improved:

*   **Prior to 2022 (15 tests):** Average reduction = 11.9 years.
*   **2022 (first 4 tests):** Average reduction = 15.2 years.

This indicates an approximate 3-year further reduction in biological age, according to the Levine PhenoAge.

A limitation of the PhenoAge model is its inclusion of chronological age, which inherently limits the maximum achievable biological age reduction. As chronological age increases, biological age calculated by this model will also increase, even if biomarkers remain stable. For example, an 80-year-old individual might achieve a best-case biological age of approximately 60 years with this test.

## Aging.ai Biological Age

In contrast to PhenoAge, the Aging.ai model does not incorporate chronological age, allowing for potentially greater biological age reductions. Using 19 biomarkers on Aging.ai 3.0, the calculated biological age was 28 years, which is 21.4 years younger than chronological age.

## Longitudinal Aging.ai Trends

Longitudinal data for Aging.ai biological age extends back to 2009. Initially, blood tests were annual (2009-2013, 3 tests), yielding an average Aging.ai age of 32 years. Starting in 2016, testing frequency increased to better reflect internal biochemistry.

*   **2016-2021 (27 tests):** Average biological age = 29.9 years.
*   **2022 (first 4 tests):** Average biological age = 28 years.

Overall, the biological age using Aging.ai has been maintained within a range of 29-32 years since 2009, with a further reduction observed in 2022.
