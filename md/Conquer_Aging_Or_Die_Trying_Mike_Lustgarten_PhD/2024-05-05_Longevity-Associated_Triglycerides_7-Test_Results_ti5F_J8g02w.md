# 2024-05-05 Longevity-Associated Triglycerides 7-Test Results

## Executive Summary
*   A study involving approximately 4.5 million people indicates that higher triglyceride (TAG) levels are associated with an increased coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality risk, particularly above 75 mg/dL.
*   However, specific triglyceride species, termed Longevity-Associated Triglycerides (LATs), are significantly linked to increased odds of living to 85 years. Key LATs identified include C56:8, C58:11, and C58:7, with statistical significance (p-value and FDR < 0.05).
*   Triglycerides are composed of a glycerol backbone and three fatty acids. A single triglyceride species can be formed by numerous different combinations of fatty acids.
*   These LATs can be tracked using metabolomics kits. The speaker's personal data indicates successful maintenance and a slight increase in the average sum of 29 LAT species from 2022 (42 µM) to 2024 (47 µM), suggesting progress in avoiding age-related decline.
*   Strategies for maintaining high levels of LATs are being investigated through dietary correlations.

## General Triglyceride Information
A study involving approximately 4.5 million people indicates that higher triglyceride (TAG) levels are associated with an increased coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality risk. Specifically, in the fully adjusted model, CHD mortality risk significantly increases above a triglyceride level of approximately 75 mg/dL.

## Longevity-Associated Triglycerides (LATs)
Not all triglycerides have the same impact on health and longevity. Research on approximately 12,000 individuals identified specific triglyceride species associated with increased odds of living to 85 years. Analysis of the log odds ratio for longevity against the log hazard ratio for all-cause mortality highlighted triglycerides with higher odds of reaching 85 and lower risk of all-cause mortality.

**Specific Longevity-Associated Triglycerides (LATs):**
*   C56:8 (56 carbons, 8 double bonds)
*   C58:11 (58 carbons, 11 double bonds)
*   C58:7 (58 carbons, 7 double bonds)
*   Four other species were also identified.

**Statistical Significance:**
For all identified LATs, the odds ratio for reaching 85 years was greater than 1 (e.g., C54:9 TAG: 1.11). The 95% confidence intervals for these odds ratios were entirely above 1, and the p-values and False Discovery Rates (FDR) were less than 0.05, confirming a significant association with increased odds of reaching 85 years.

The objective is to maintain relatively high levels of these longevity-associated triglycerides, which can be tracked and potentially optimized. One method for tracking these is an at-home metabolomics kit (e.g., IOLO's), which measures 241 triglyceride species, including 29 longevity-associated triglycerides that correspond to the identified five species. The kit also provides data for over 385 other metabolites.

## Triglyceride Biochemistry
Triglycerides consist of a glycerol backbone to which three fatty acids are esterified. The specific combination of these three fatty acids determines the overall triglyceride species. Different fatty acids can attach at each of the three positions on the glycerol backbone, leading to a wide variety of triglyceride structures.

**Triglyceride Formation Example:**
Glycerol Backbone
-> Esterification with Fatty Acid 1 (e.g., C12:1)
-> Esterification with Fatty Acid 2 (e.g., C12:1)
-> Esterification with Fatty Acid 3 (e.g., C12:1)
-> Forms a specific Triglyceride (e.g., C36:3, if all three are C12:1 fatty acids)

This variability in fatty acid composition at each position explains how a single triglyceride species (e.g., C56:6) can be formed by numerous different fatty acid combinations. For example, while C54:9 may have a singular metabolic precursor, a species like C56:6 can result from diverse fatty acid combinations (e.g., C22:4 + C34:2, or C24:0 + C32:6).

## Personal Tracking Results for Longevity-Associated Triglycerides
The speaker tracks the sum of 29 longevity-associated triglyceride species (corresponding to the five key LATs) to maintain relatively high levels.

*   **2023 Results (5 Tests):**
    *   Lowest sum: 17.5 µM (Test 1)
    *   Highest sum: 79 µM (Test 3)
    *   Objective: Keep these values high.

*   **Year-to-Year Comparison (Average Sum of 29 LATs):**
    *   2022 Average: 42 µM (based on five tests)
    *   2024 Average (first two tests): 47 µM
    *   Trend: The 2024 average shows an increase compared to 2022, indicating success in avoiding age-related decline and maintaining high levels of these specific triglycerides.

## Optimization Strategies
Strategies for maintaining high levels of longevity-associated triglycerides involve analyzing correlations with dietary intake.
