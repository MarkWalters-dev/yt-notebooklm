# 2020-12-27 Microbial Products Affect the Hallmarks Of Aging - Mitochondrial Function Part I

### Executive Summary

*   Bacterial cells and genes significantly outnumber human cells and genes in the body, suggesting a profound impact of microbes on human biology, including the hallmarks of aging.
*   Mitochondrial function declines with aging, characterized by decreased ATP production and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, establishing mitochondrial dysfunction as a hallmark of aging.
*   Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin from Gram-negative bacteria, increases in blood plasma with age in both rodent models and human populations.
*   Elevated LPS levels negatively impact mitochondrial function by reducing ATP synthesis and increasing the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species like superoxide and hydrogen peroxide.
*   Interestingly, centenarians exhibit *lower* blood LPS levels compared to healthy young controls, suggesting a potential link between reduced LPS and extreme longevity, possibly due to better gut barrier function.

## The Human Microbiome's Influence on Aging

The human body contains more bacterial cells than human cells (1.3 to 2.2 fold greater in young adults, 1.8 fold in older adults, and 1.4 fold in obese individuals). Furthermore, bacterial genes outnumber human genes by more than 100 to one. This substantial microbial presence suggests that microbes can significantly influence the hallmarks of aging. This discussion focuses on the impact of microbial products on mitochondrial dysfunction, a key hallmark of aging.

## Mitochondrial Function Overview

Mitochondria are crucial organelles primarily responsible for producing energy in the form of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). This process occurs via the electron transport chain (ETC) on the mitochondrial inner membrane, where the oxidation of NADH and FADH2 drives biochemical and electrical processes culminating in ATP synthesis by ATP synthase.

A byproduct of this energy production is the formation of superoxide, a toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), when electrons leak and are picked up by oxygen. Fortunately, the body has detoxification mechanisms for ROS:

Superoxide (toxic)
-> (Manganese Superoxide Dismutase, MnSOD)
-> Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) (less toxic)
-> (Catalase)
-> Water (H2O) + Oxygen (O2)

## Mitochondrial Dysfunction as a Hallmark of Aging

Mitochondrial function consistently declines with aging. In young individuals, muscle mitochondria exhibit high levels of ATP production and low levels of superoxide. In contrast, older muscle mitochondria produce less ATP (energy) and generate more superoxide. This age-related decline in mitochondrial function is a well-established hallmark of aging.

## Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Aging

A microbial product, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is increasingly recognized for its negative impact on mitochondrial function and its age-related increase. LPS is an endotoxin found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.

### Age-Related Increase in Blood LPS

*   **Rodent Data:** Studies in mice show an age-related increase in plasma LPS levels. For example, 18-month-old mice (middle-aged equivalent) exhibit significantly higher circulating LPS than 4-month-old mice (teenager equivalent). Similar increases are observed in aged rats.
*   **Human Data:**
    *   A small study comparing 26-year-olds and 74-year-olds found a significant increase in plasma LPS in the older adults.
    *   Larger studies, including a preprint with over 1,100 participants, show that plasma LPS levels significantly increase in individuals aged 60 and older compared to 20-year-olds.

### Sources of LPS in the Blood

LPS can enter the bloodstream through two main routes:

1.  **Gut Translocation:**
    *   The gut microbiome contains a high concentration of Gram-negative bacteria, a primary source of LPS.
    *   Under healthy conditions, intact tight junctions between intestinal epithelial cells prevent substances from the gut lumen from entering the bloodstream.
    *   However, with intestinal barrier dysfunction (leaky gut), these tight junctions weaken, allowing whole bacteria, bacterial products like LPS, other metabolites, and bacterial vesicles to translocate from the gut lumen into the blood.
2.  **Blood Microbiome:**
    *   A blood microbiome exists, even in young individuals. In 21-year-olds, proteobacteria (a Gram-negative phylum) constitute 83% of the blood microbiome.
    *   While large studies comparing the blood microbiome in young versus old adults are lacking, it is hypothesized that an age-related increase in blood proteobacteria could contribute to higher circulating LPS levels.

### LPS Levels in Centenarians

Contrary to the general age-related increase, centenarians have been observed to have *lower* levels of blood LPS compared to healthy young controls. This could be due to:

*   **Survivor Bias:** Centenarians may possess inherently healthier gut barrier function or a more favorable blood microbiome composition, allowing them to live longer.
*   **Good Gut Barrier Function:** Reduced gut permeability in centenarians could prevent LPS translocation.
*   **Stable Blood Microbiome:** A lack of age-related alterations in their blood microbiome might contribute to lower LPS.

## LPS Negatively Impacts Mitochondrial Function

### Decreased Mitochondrial ATP Production

Studies using macrophages show that exposure to LPS leads to a decrease in the ATP to ADP ratio, indicating reduced energy production. To confirm this reduction is mitochondrial, researchers use oligomycin, an inhibitor of ATP synthase (Complex V of the mitochondrial ETC). When oligomycin is applied, the remaining ATP production, which is non-mitochondrial, is similar in both control and LPS-treated macrophages. This suggests that the decrease in overall ATP production in the presence of LPS is predominantly due to impaired mitochondrial ATP synthesis.

### Increased Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Production

LPS exposure also leads to an increase in mitochondrial ROS:

*   **Superoxide Production:** Macrophages treated with LPS show higher levels of mitochondria-specific superoxide, as measured by a mitochondria-targeting dye.
*   **Hydrogen Peroxide Production:** Macrophages exposed to LPS exhibit a dramatic increase in cellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels over 2, 6, and 24 hours. To determine the mitochondrial contribution to this H2O2, catalase (which degrades H2O2 into water and oxygen) was overexpressed in the mitochondria of macrophages (MCAT macrophages). The significant reduction in H2O2 levels in MCAT macrophages demonstrated that the vast majority of the LPS-induced H2O2 production originated from the mitochondria.

## Conclusion and Future Directions

Mitochondrial function declines with aging, and LPS levels increase with aging. High levels of LPS negatively impact mitochondrial function by decreasing ATP production and increasing ROS.

It is important to note that many in vitro studies on LPS and mitochondrial function use LPS concentrations 500 to 1000 times higher than physiologically relevant levels observed in humans, particularly during aging. Therefore, a critical unanswered question is whether more physiologically relevant concentrations of LPS, and other microbial products, negatively affect mitochondrial function in aged individuals. This area requires further research.
