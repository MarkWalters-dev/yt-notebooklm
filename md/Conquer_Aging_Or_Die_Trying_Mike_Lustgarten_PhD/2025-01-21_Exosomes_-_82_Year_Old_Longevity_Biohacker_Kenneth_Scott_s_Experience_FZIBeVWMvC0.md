# 2025-01-21 Exosomes - 82 Year Old Longevity Biohacker Kenneth Scott s Experience

## Executive Summary

*   Amniotic fluid-derived exosomes are processed and filtered to be less than 125 nanometers, which helps prevent an immune system reaction.
*   These exosomes contain a rich array of youthful signaling molecules and metabolites, possessing significant regenerative potential.
*   Users report rapid and substantial pain reduction, particularly for tendon damage (e.g., Cipro-induced), and a general feeling of enhanced well-being or a "high" post-treatment.
*   Due to inherent batch variability, FDA approval is unlikely; however, the therapy is accessible in the United States for off-label use by physicians.

## Source and Processing of Amniotic Exosomes

*   Exosomes are sourced from amniotic fluid, specifically obtained from full-term healthy baby births.
*   A company called CRM (Center for Regenerative Medicine), associated with Dr. Farshan and the American Academy of Stem Cell Physicians, processes the fluid.
*   The processing includes filtering by size to ensure exosomes are less than 125 nanometers.
*   This small size is critical as it helps prevent the immune system from reacting to them.
*   Each batch of amniotic exosomes is unique, coming from different births, necessitating a detailed safety process by CRM to ensure safety.

## Mechanism and Benefits

*   Exosomes are described as containing extensive "nutrition" and a wide range of youthful signaling molecules and metabolites.
*   These components are associated with the regenerative processes fundamental to development from a fertilized egg into a complete human being.
*   The small size of the exosomes (<125 nm) allows them to evade immune detection, facilitating their therapeutic action.

## Personal Experiences with Exosome Therapy

*   **Kenneth Scott's Wife:**
    *   Suffered continual pain for approximately one year due to Cipro-induced tendon damage.
    *   Received amniotic exosome treatment.
    *   Experienced an immense reduction in pain within three weeks.
    *   While some tendon pain persists after five years, the initial improvement from one treatment was significant.
*   **Kenneth Scott:**
    *   Reported feeling "on such a high" after his first exosome treatment.
    *   Both he and his wife have undergone approximately half a dozen treatments.
*   **Dave Pascoe (62-year-old biohacker):**
    *   Described a similar sensation of being "on a high" after exosome treatment.
    *   His shoulder issue resolved after exosome injection.
    *   The issue recurred only after he over-exercised, highlighting the initial healing potential provided by the exosomes.

## Regulatory Landscape and Accessibility

*   Exosome therapy is considered relatively inexpensive and is available in the United States.
*   The inherent variability of each exosome batch (originating from different births) presents a challenge for FDA approval, as the FDA typically requires identical composition for approved therapies.
*   However, doctors can legally administer amniotic exosomes in the US for off-label use, provided they do not make specific claims about their efficacy.
*   Some doctors utilize amniotic exosomes to counter effects from Cipro, consistent with observed benefits for tendon damage.
