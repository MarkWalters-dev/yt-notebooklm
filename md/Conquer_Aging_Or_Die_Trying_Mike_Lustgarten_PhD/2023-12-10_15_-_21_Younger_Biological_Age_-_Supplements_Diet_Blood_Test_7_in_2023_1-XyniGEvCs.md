# 2023-12-10 15 - 21 Younger Biological Age - Supplements Diet Blood Test 7 in 2023

## Executive Summary
*   Biological age was calculated as 15-21 years younger than chronological age using doctor Morgan Levine's PhenoAge and aging.ai calculators.
*   The supplementation protocol included Levothyroxine (for hypothyroidism), Vitamin D, Methyl B12 (to reduce Homocysteine and in correlation with lower Horvath epigenetic age), and low-dose Nicotinic Acid (to boost NAD while managing potential impact on epigenetic pace).
*   Diet composition prioritizes foods with strong positive correlations to 25 biomarkers, such as strawberries (+11 score) and collard greens (+7 score), while adjusting intake of foods like carrots (0 score) due to its beta-carotene content, which has a negative correlative score (-4).
*   Average daily caloric intake was 2106 calories (the lowest recorded), with macronutrient distribution approximately 18% protein, 35% fat (adjusted to 43% when including fiber calories), and 39% net carbohydrates.
*   Micronutrient intake ensures full Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) coverage, with several, notably Vitamin K, consumed at significantly higher levels (e.g., 24 times the RDA) based on their strong positive correlations with health biomarkers.

## Supplements

The following supplements were taken during the 49-day period corresponding to this blood test (10/09/2023 - 11/26/2023):

*   **Levothyroxine:** 137.5 micrograms per day. This has been taken for approximately half of the speaker's life due to a diagnosis of hypothyroidism in their early to mid-twenties.
*   **Vitamin D:** 2000 International Units (IUs) per day, taken for 47 out of 49 days.
    *   **Rationale & Experiment:** The dose was doubled from the usual 1000 IUs per day due to previous significant inverse correlations observed between higher Vitamin D intake and lower levels of creatinine (a marker of kidney function) and glucose (over 47 and 45 blood tests, respectively, since 2015).
    *   **Result:** Despite doubling the dose, creatinine and glucose levels did not improve. This indicates a correlation but not causation for Vitamin D's effect on these specific biomarkers in this instance.
    *   **Future Plan:** For the next test (test #1 in 2024), Vitamin D supplementation will return to 1000 IUs per day.
*   **Methyl B12:** 1000 micrograms per day, taken for all 49 days.
    *   **Rationale:**
        *   To limit Homocysteine levels, as Methyl B12 is the only variable (among folate, choline, B6, serine) that has significantly impacted keeping Homocysteine lower.
        *   Higher B12 intake is significantly correlated with a lower Horvath epigenetic age over nine tests.
    *   **Homocysteine Reduction Pathway:**
        Homocysteine -> (Methyl B12) -> Methionine
*   **Nicotinic Acid:** 60 milligrams per day, taken for 23 out of 49 days.
    *   **Rationale:** This low dose aims to boost NAD levels without potentially impacting the epigenetic pace of aging, a concern observed with higher doses (up to 600 milligrams per day) in previous tests.
    *   **Future Plan:** Further NAD and epigenetic testing will be conducted to identify the optimal Nicotinic Acid dose that maximizes NAD without negatively affecting epigenetic pace.

## Diet Composition

Dietary intake was tracked over the 49-day period (10/09/2023 - 11/26/2023). The dietary strategy is based on correlations between food intake and 25 biomarkers (including blood markers, slow-wave sleep, and systolic blood pressure), using data from 9 to 33 tests since 2018 (or 2015 for macros/micros). Foods are ranked by intake, with an emphasis on those with strong net positive correlative scores.

*   **Top Foods (by intake):**
    *   **Green Tea:** Organic loose-leaf green tea sourced from Japan is a staple due to studies from Asia (Japan and China) showing higher intake associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Strawberries:** Intake for this test averaged approximately 600 grams/day, which is above the average intake of 407 grams/day since 2018. Strawberries have a strong net correlative score of +11, meaning they are significantly correlated with a net of 11 biomarkers moving in a youth-associated direction (e.g., inversely correlated with blood pressure).
    *   **Collard Greens:** Intake averaged approximately 300 grams/day, which is above the average intake of 84 grams/day since 2018. Collard greens have a strong net correlative score of +7.
    *   **Carrots:** Intake averaged 259 grams/day, which is below the average intake of 353 grams/day since 2018. Carrots have a net correlative score of 0. This intake is deliberately kept below average because beta-carotene, abundant in carrots, has a net correlative score of -4 in the speaker's data. Prioritizing collard greens (with a +7 score) over increasing carrot intake helps manage overall beta-carotene levels.

*   **Dietary Experiment: Egg Intake for Homocysteine:**
    *   **Protocol:** Egg intake was doubled to an average of approximately 4 eggs per week (from 2 eggs/week in the previous test).
    *   **Rationale:** Eggs are a rich source of choline, which is involved in the methionine cycle to reduce homocysteine.
    *   **Proposed Pathway:**
        Choline -> Betaine (Trimethylglycine)
        Homocysteine + Betaine -> Methionine (reducing Homocysteine)
    *   **Result:** Homocysteine levels remained relatively high at 9.8 micromolar, indicating the experiment did not achieve the desired reduction.
    *   **Future Plan:** Eggs have been temporarily cut from the diet pending epigenetic data analysis, as choline also feeds into methylation pathways that could impact Horvath or Dunedin Pace.

*   **Cheat Days:**
    *   Limited to a maximum of two "cheat meals" per 49-day period to maintain long-term dietary adherence.
    *   For this test, cheat meals included chocolate mixed with peanut butter and Starburst candy.
    *   Calories from these foods accounted for 1.3% of total caloric intake, indicating a diet that is nearly 99% clean.

*   **Top Calorie Contributors:**
    *   Sardines are the primary source of calories, a consistent finding across multiple tests due to their positive net correlative score.
    *   The top 10 calorie-contributing foods remained mostly consistent with the previous test (Test #6), reflecting an intentional effort to maintain dietary consistency and make small, targeted tweaks.

## Macronutrients

*   **Average Daily Calorie Intake:** 2106 calories per day (49-day average). This represents the lowest average daily calorie intake recorded since tracking began in 2015, a result of a purposeful, sequential reduction over time. (The previous level was 2122 calories/day for Test #6).

*   **Protein Intake:**
    *   96 grams per day (49-day average).
    *   **Rationale:** Protein has a net correlative score of -4 with the 25 biomarkers. The average protein intake since 2015 is 110 grams/day. To follow the negative correlation, intake is targeted below average.
    *   **Percentage of Calories:** Approximately 18%.

*   **Fat Intake:**
    *   81 grams per day (49-day average).
    *   **Rationale:** Fat has a net correlative score of -1 with the 25 biomarkers (statistically significant, p < 0.05). The average fat intake since 2015 is 85 grams/day. To follow the negative correlation, intake is targeted below average.
    *   **Percentage of Calories:** Approximately 35%.
    *   **Fat Breakdown:** Includes monounsaturated, polyunsaturated (omega-3, omega-6), and other fats. Cronometer data shows approximately a 20-gram deficit when summing sub-categories to total fat, mainly due to incomplete data for foods like cocoa beans and sardines. This is considered a systematic error given the consistent diet.

*   **Carbohydrate Intake:**
    *   **Total Carbs:** 287 grams per day (49-day average).
    *   **Fiber Intake:** 82.5 grams per day.
    *   **Net Carbs:** 205 grams per day (Total Carbs - Fiber).
    *   **Percentage of Calories from Net Carbs:** Approximately 39%.
    *   **Fructose Intake:** Total fructose was 58 grams per day (calculated as fructose + sucrose/2). This is close to the lowest fructose intake since 2015 (57.5 grams) and approximately half of previous higher intakes. Fructose has a net negative correlative score, so its intake is monitored to keep it relatively low.

*   **Soluble Fiber and Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs):**
    *   Soluble fiber is fermented by gut bacteria into Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs).
    *   **Pathway:**
        Soluble Fiber -> Gut Bacteria -> Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)
    *   SCFAs contribute approximately 2 calories per gram of fiber.
    *   From 82.5 grams of fiber, this yields about 175 calories, representing approximately 8% of total daily calories.

*   **Net Macronutrient Percentages (including fiber calories added to fat):**
    *   Fat: ~43%
    *   Net Carbs: ~39%
    *   Protein: ~18%

## Micronutrients

*   **General Approach:** The diet ensures full Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) coverage for all micronutrients. Intake levels for many micronutrients are purposely higher than the RDA based on their correlations with the 25 biomarkers.

*   **Vitamin K:**
    *   Intake: Approximately 2400 micrograms per day, which is about 24 times the adequate intake of approximately 100 micrograms.
    *   **Rationale:** Vitamin K has a strong net correlative score of +5 with the 25 biomarkers. Intake is intentionally maintained above average to align with this positive correlation.

*   **Beta-carotene:**
    *   Intake: Approximately 50,000 micrograms (50 milligrams) per day.
    *   **Rationale:** Beta-carotene has a net correlative score of -4 in the speaker's data. The intake is maintained below the average of 53,000 micrograms/day since 2015 to follow this negative correlation, which also influences the choice to consume fewer carrots and more collard greens.

*   **Mineral Intake:**
    *   Mineral intake for this test (Test #7) is purposely consistent with the previous test (Test #6). This consistency reflects the strategy of making small, targeted dietary adjustments rather than drastic changes, given the generally youthful biomarker profile.
