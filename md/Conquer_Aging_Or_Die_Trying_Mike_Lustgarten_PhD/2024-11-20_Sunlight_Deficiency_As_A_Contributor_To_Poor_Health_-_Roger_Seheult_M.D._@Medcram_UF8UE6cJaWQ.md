# 2024-11-20 Sunlight Deficiency As A Contributor To Poor Health - Roger Seheult M.D. @Medcram

## Executive Summary

*   **Mitochondrial Function and Melatonin:** Mitochondria, the powerhouses of cells, are central to aging and chronic disease. They produce melatonin, a potent antioxidant, which acts as a "cooling system" for mitochondria, reducing oxidative stress and improving ATP production.
*   **Near-Infrared Light and Melatonin Production:** Near-infrared (NIR) light, a component of sunlight, is a free and readily available stimulus that significantly increases melatonin production within mitochondria, far exceeding the levels produced by the pineal gland.
*   **Sunlight's Physiological Benefits:** Exposure to sunlight, particularly NIR light, penetrates deep into the body, interacting with mitochondria to reduce oxidative stress, increase ATP and carbon dioxide production, and lower glucose levels, leading to improved metabolic health and reduced inflammation.
*   **Epidemiological Evidence for Sunlight:** Large-scale epidemiological studies consistently show a correlation between increased sunlight exposure and reduced all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality, and cancer mortality. Conversely, night light exposure is linked to higher mortality risks.
*   **Green Spaces and Health Outcomes:** Proximity to or spending time in green spaces is associated with significant health benefits, including reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and premature death, likely due to increased exposure to reflected infrared light.

## Introduction to Light and Health

*   Hospitals are increasingly designed to incorporate natural light due to emerging data on its health benefits.
*   Chronic diseases (heart disease, diabetes, obesity, dementia, inflammation, long COVID, cancer) are major impediments to longevity.
*   A common underlying factor in these chronic diseases is mitochondrial dysfunction, which is considered central to the aging process.

## Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Melatonin

*   **Mitochondrial Function:** Mitochondria are responsible for generating ATP, the energy currency of cells. As we age, mitochondrial ATP production declines, contributing to age-related decline and disease.
    *   Mitochondria use fuel (proteins, fats, glucose) to produce ATP.
    *   This process also generates heat and oxidative stress, which can impair mitochondrial function.
*   **Melatonin's Role:** Melatonin is a powerful antioxidant that can neutralize oxidative stress, acting as a "cooling system" for mitochondria and maintaining their efficiency.
    *   While melatonin is known for its role in sleep regulation from the pineal gland, significantly larger quantities are produced within the mitochondria themselves.
    *   Mitochondrial melatonin is consumed locally to combat free radical damage within cells.

## The Role of Sunlight and Near-Infrared Light

*   Sunlight is a free and accessible stimulus that increases mitochondrial melatonin production.
*   **Composition of Sunlight:** The majority of solar photons consist of near-infrared (NIR) radiation.
*   **Near-Infrared Light Characteristics:**
    *   **Invisible:** Lies beyond the visible red spectrum; undetectable by the naked eye.
    *   **Perceptible:** Felt as warmth when exposed to the sun.
    *   **Penetrating:** Can pass through clothing and skin, reaching deep into the body.
    *   **Low Frequency Energy:** Similar to low-frequency sound waves that penetrate obstacles, NIR light penetrates deeply.
    *   **Interaction with Mitochondria:** NIR light interacts with specific absorbers within mitochondria, initiating beneficial biological processes.
    *   **Penetration Depth:** Longer wavelengths (further to the right on a spectrum) correspond to lower frequencies and deeper penetration into the body, with NIR light reaching up to 8 centimeters.
*   **Penetration Through Clothing:** Even with one or two layers of clothing, approximately 50% of NIR light can still reach the body.
*   **Reflection from Greenery:** Trees, grass, and leaves are highly reflective of infrared light, meaning green environments can provide 2-4 times more infrared exposure.
*   **Infrared Light and Heat:** NIR light carries heat. Leaves of trees reflect this heat, keeping them cool even on a hot day. The area beneath a tree is cooler due to this reflection.

## Physiological Effects of Near-Infrared Light Exposure

*   **Mitochondrial Interaction:** NIR light penetrates the skin, scatters within the body, and is absorbed by mitochondria.
*   **Biochemical Outcomes:**
    *   Reduces oxidative stress.
    *   Increases ATP production.
    *   Increases carbon dioxide production.
    *   Utilizes fuel, leading to a drop in glucose levels.

## Human Evidence for Sunlight's Benefits

### Red Light Therapy and Glucose Metabolism

*   **Study:** Subjects exposed to red light (670 nm) showed a smaller increase in blood glucose after a glucose bolus compared to those not receiving red light.
*   **Mechanism:** Energized mitochondria utilized fuel more efficiently, leading to increased ATP and carbon dioxide production.
*   **Confirmation:** Higher levels of exhaled carbon dioxide were measured in subjects receiving red light.
*   **Implications:** Potential benefits for managing diabetes and glucose-related issues.

### Epidemiological Studies

*   **Short-Term Exposure (Oxford Study):**
    *   Examined blood tests (triglycerides, insulin sensitivity) in relation to reported sunlight hours in the preceding seven days.
    *   Found that more sunlight hours correlated with improved insulin sensitivity and reduced triglycerides.
*   **Long-Term Exposure (Southern Sweden Study - 30,000 women):**
    *   Categorized women based on sun avoidance, moderate sun exposure, and avid sun exposure.
    *   **Findings:**
        *   Sun avoiders had higher total mortality rates.
        *   Increased sunlight exposure correlated with lower all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality, cancer mortality, and non-cardiovascular disease mortality.
    *   **Dose-Response:** The observed dose-response curve strongly suggests a causal relationship.
    *   **Magnitude of Effect:** Nonsmokers avoiding sun had a life expectancy similar to smokers with the highest sun exposure.
*   **Replication (UK Biobank Study - 300,000 individuals):**
    *   Confirmed the findings of the Southern Sweden study, showing reduced all-cause, cardiovascular disease, and cancer mortality with greater sun exposure.
    *   Interestingly, data also indicated a reduction in all cancer mortality despite common concerns about skin cancer.

### Light at Night (Artificial Light)

*   **Satellite Data Studies:** Link increased exposure to night light to higher mortality risks.
*   **UK Biobank Study (Wearable Light Sensors):**
    *   Monitored light exposure at all hours in 88,000 individuals.
    *   **Findings:** Sunlight exposure during the day reduced mortality across various categories (all-cause, cardiometabolic, other causes).
    *   Bright light exposure from midnight to 7 AM was detrimental.
    *   Beneficial effects of light were observed from the morning until around 9 PM.
    *   **Conclusion:** Maintaining dark environments at night and seeking bright light during the day are crucial for enhancing circadian rhythms and potentially reducing disease burden and increasing longevity.

### Green Spaces and Health

*   **Association:** Living in or spending time in green spaces is linked to better health outcomes.
*   **Observed Benefits:**
    *   28% reduction in Type 2 Diabetes.
    *   16% reduction in cardiovascular mortality.
    *   31% reduction in total mortality.
*   **Study (South Louisville, Kentucky):**
    *   Planted 8,000 mature trees in a four-square-mile area.
    *   **Outcome:** A 13% reduction in CRP levels (a marker for cardiovascular disease) over two to three years. This reduction was comparable to that achieved with regular exercise.
*   **Meta-Analysis Findings:**
    *   Reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, premature death, preterm birth.
    *   Increased sleep duration.
    *   Reduced diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and stress markers.
    *   Significant reduction in salivary cortisol levels (a physiological marker of stress).

### Dermatological Reconsideration of Sunlight

*   A 2024 publication in the *Journal of Investigative Dermatology* titled "Sunlight, Time for a Rethink" acknowledges the beneficial effects of sunlight exposure and calls for further research.
*   Dermatological organizations are beginning to recognize and highlight the necessity of studying these beneficial effects.

## Sunlight and COVID-19

*   **Initial Observations in ICUs:** Critically ill COVID-19 patients often presented with metabolic disorders and mitochondrial dysfunction, not just respiratory issues.
*   **ACE2 Receptor:** This receptor, targeted by SARS-CoV-2, also plays a crucial role in modulating oxidative stress. Viral infection can deplete ACE2 receptors, exacerbating oxidative stress in susceptible individuals.
*   **Vitamin D Levels:** Patients with low vitamin D levels were observed to have worse outcomes. However, oral vitamin D supplementation showed mixed results, suggesting it might be a marker of something else.
*   **Hypothesis:** Patients with higher vitamin D levels may have benefited not only from UVB (vitamin D production) but also from the infrared spectrum of sunlight, which enhances mitochondrial melatonin.
*   **Geographical Correlation:**
    *   **COVID-19 Surges and Latitude:** A study in *Scientific Reports* (2021) found that COVID-19 surges in 2020 correlated perfectly with latitude, not temperature or humidity, as sunlight decreased in the Northern Hemisphere and moved to the Southern Hemisphere.
    *   **COVID-19 Mortality and Sunlight:** A study in *Epidemiology* (2021) found that increased sunlight exposure was associated with lower COVID-19 mortality in the US, England, and Italy. It suggested optimizing sun exposure as a public health intervention, potentially independent of vitamin D.
*   **Overweight Rates and Latitude:** A study published in *Melatonin Research* (2022) found an association between COVID-19 and latitude in countries with >50% overweight rates.

## Seasonal Patterns of Mortality

*   **All-Cause Natural Deaths:** Nearly all natural causes of death (heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes, influenza, kidney disease) peak at the end of the year, shortly after the shortest day.
*   **Geographic Shift:** This pattern shifts by six months in the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., Australia), aligning with their shortest day in July.
*   **Temperature vs. Sunlight:** The consistency of this pattern across different climates (e.g., mild winters in Australia) suggests that temperature is not the primary driver; rather, it points to the amount of sunlight.

### Influenza and Sunlight

*   **Harvard Kennedy School Study:** Analyzed solar radiation data and CDC influenza data.
*   **Finding:** Found that sunlight strongly protected against getting influenza. This effect was independent of temperature or humidity.
*   **Timing:** In 2009, reduced sunlight across the country preceded an early H1N1 epidemic, and this was linked to specific areas with less sunlight.

## Mechanism of Sunlight's Benefit: Infrared Light Therapy

*   **Study Findings:** Infrared light therapy has been shown to:
    *   Reduce toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) dependent hyperinflammation.
    *   Decrease levels of inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, IL-8, and Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha.
    *   Modulate interferon production, potentially mitigating the cytokine storm associated with severe COVID-19.
    *   Chronic exposure to natural sunlight appears to attenuate the humoral immune response, which can be dysregulated in severe infections.

### Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) of Near-Infrared Light for COVID-19

*   **Study Design:** 30 inpatients with COVID-19 were treated with a jacket emitting 940 nm near-infrared light for 15 minutes daily for seven days, or a placebo.
*   **Blinding:** The infrared light is invisible, making the treatment blinded by definition.
*   **Outcomes (NIR Group vs. Control):**
    *   Faster and higher improvement in oxygen saturation.
    *   Faster improvement in respiratory rate and heart rate.
    *   Increase in lymphocytes (important for clearing infected cells), whereas lymphocytes continued to drop in the control group.
    *   **Discharge:** Patients receiving NIR light were discharged an average of **four days faster** than the control group.
*   **Implications:** Significant financial implications for hospitals due to reduced length of stay, especially in DRG (Diagnosis-Related Group) payment models.

## Personal Case Study: COVID-19 Patient and Sunlight

*   A patient admitted with severe COVID-19, requiring high levels of oxygen and on the verge of intubation, was taken outside into sunlight for 20-30 minutes daily.
*   **Outcome:** Significant improvement was observed within days, with oxygen requirements decreasing rapidly. The patient was discharged without the need for oxygen.
*   **Reflection:** The patient reported feeling significant benefit from the sunlight, highlighting its profound impact.

## Historical Perspectives on Light Therapy

*   **Florence Nightingale:** Advocated for fresh air and light (including direct sunlight) as crucial for recovery in the sick.
*   **Ellen G. White:** A health reformer and founder of Loma Linda University, emphasized spending time outdoors in sunshine for health and vitality, comparing it to the needs of shaded plants. She also advised against turning night into day and extinguishing lights after 9 PM.
*   **Sanitariums:** Historically, hospitals and sanitariums were designed to maximize patient access to sunlight, with architecture incorporating outdoor spaces and patient beds placed near windows.

## Impact of Modern Architecture and Lighting

*   **Indoor Living:** Humans spend approximately 93% of their lives indoors.
*   **Window Technology:** Modern windows (e.g., Low-E coatings) are designed to block infrared light to reduce cooling costs, preventing its beneficial penetration.
*   **LED Lighting:** Energy-efficient LED bulbs often have the infrared spectrum removed, unlike traditional incandescent bulbs.
*   **Forced LED Use:** Newer building codes and fixture designs may mandate the use of LED bulbs, limiting access to infrared light.

## Biomarkers of Sunlight Exposure

*   **Vitamin D:** A well-known biomarker for UVB exposure.
*   **Emerging Biomarkers for Red/Near-Infrared Light:**
    *   **Nitric Oxide:** Short-lived, but its production is influenced by light.
    *   **Melatonin in Sweat:** Studies are exploring sweat melatonin concentration as a potential surrogate marker for infrared light exposure, as it may be produced locally in response to NIR light.
    *   **Light Meters:** Developing devices specifically to measure infrared light exposure.

### Melatonin: Antioxidant Powerhouse

*   **Mitochondrial Production:** Melatonin is produced in mitochondria and is considered a highly potent antioxidant within this organelle.
*   **Regulation of Glutathione:** Melatonin upregulates glutathione, another crucial antioxidant, making it exceptionally powerful in the human system, not just based on reaction rate constants but also regulatory effects.
*   **Tryptophan:** While tryptophan is a precursor to melatonin, studies suggest it may not be the rate-limiting step for mitochondrial melatonin production; red light's effect on the electron transport chain appears more critical.

## Building Design and Window Considerations

*   **Greenhouse Design:** Greenhouses are often designed to allow a full spectrum of light, including infrared, to enter.
*   **Low-E Glass:** Standard Low-E glass in homes typically blocks infrared light, which is undesirable for maximizing health benefits.
*   **Creative Solutions:** In colder climates, windows that do not block infrared might be more common and beneficial for heating.
*   **Prioritizing Outdoor Exposure:** Given the challenges with indoor light, getting outside is the most reliable way to access beneficial light.
*   **Rapid Effects:** Sunlight's effects on the human body can be rapid (within days), with benefits potentially lasting for several days.

## Practical Recommendations

*   **Intentional Sunlight Exposure:** Aim for 20-30 minutes of intentional outdoor sunlight exposure daily, especially during winter when indoor living is more prevalent and sunlight is limited.
*   **Open Windows:** Open windows to allow natural light, including infrared, to enter indoor spaces.
*   **Supplementing with Light (for low sunlight areas):** In regions with limited sunlight (e.g., Northern latitudes in winter), consider using SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) lights for morning exposure to set circadian rhythms, and potentially red/near-infrared light panels for other benefits.
*   **Natural Fireplaces:** Fireplaces emit black body radiation that includes a band of infrared and near-infrared light.

## Circadian Rhythm and Hormonal Regulation

*   **Cortisol and Melatonin:**
    *   **Cortisol:** The "hormone of the day," stimulated by morning light, helps prepare the body for activity. Lack of morning light can delay this crucial pulse.
    *   **Melatonin:** The "hormone of the night," produced when light is absent. Artificial light after 9-10 PM can suppress melatonin production.
*   **Morning Light:** Essential for setting circadian rhythms, boosting cortisol, and providing energy.
*   **Evening Darkness:** Crucial for allowing melatonin production and promoting restful sleep.
*   **SAD Lights:** Can be beneficial for setting circadian rhythms and addressing Seasonal Affective Disorder by providing 10,000 lux of light (with blue light components) for about 20 minutes in the morning.

## Case Study: Aggressive Lymphoma and Mucormycosis

*   A 15-year-old boy with aggressive B-cell lymphoma developed a life-threatening fungal infection (mucormycosis) after chemotherapy.
*   **Hospitalization:** Extensive treatment within the hospital, without natural light access, failed to control the infection.
*   **Lung Removal:** The left lung was surgically removed, but the fungus spread to the right lung.
*   **Desperate Situation:** Prognosis was grim, with physicians expecting the patient to die within two days.
*   **Sunlight Intervention:** The patient expressed a desire to go outside. He spent several hours outdoors in sunlight over four days, with intermittent use of a "firefly" device (UV + infrared light).
*   **Remarkable Recovery:**
    *   Fever disappeared.
    *   White blood cell counts normalized.
    *   Oxygen requirements dramatically decreased.
    *   The fungal infection in the right lung showed significant improvement on CT scans.
    *   The patient was discharged home, no longer suffering from mucormycosis, and continued chemotherapy for his lymphoma.
*   **Significance:** This case highlights the potent therapeutic potential of sunlight, even in seemingly hopeless situations.

## Conclusion: Embracing Sunlight for Longevity

*   **The Problem:** Modern lifestyles and built environments significantly limit our exposure to beneficial sunlight, particularly infrared light. This deficiency may be a significant contributor to the rise in chronic diseases.
*   **The Solution:**
    *   Prioritize intentional daily outdoor sunlight exposure (20-30 minutes).
    *   Maximize natural light in homes and workplaces by opening windows.
    *   Consider historical and natural approaches to health that emphasize light and fresh air.
*   **Call to Action:** "Let's take this fight outside" against chronic disease by re-integrating sunlight into our lives.
