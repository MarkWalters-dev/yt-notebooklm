# 2025-03-16 Which Factors May Help Resist Testosterone s Age-Related Decline

Testosterone levels peak in youth, followed by an age-related decline. To resist this decline, it's important to identify factors associated with higher testosterone.

### Executive Summary

*   **BMI and Testosterone:** Higher Body Mass Index (BMI) is significantly associated with lower testosterone levels. Men with a BMI below 22.4 typically exhibit the highest testosterone, while those with a BMI of 37 or higher show significantly lower levels (e.g., 11.4 nanomolar compared to 17.6 nanomolar for BMI 22.5-24.9).
*   **Body Fat Percentage:** A higher overall body fat percentage is significantly associated with lower testosterone. The leanest individuals (lowest quintile of body fat) tend to have the highest testosterone levels.
*   **Visceral and Subcutaneous Fat:** Both higher visceral fat (fat surrounding organs) and higher abdominal subcutaneous fat (fat beneath the skin) are independently associated with lower testosterone.
*   **Weight Loss Increases Testosterone:** Longitudinal studies demonstrate a causal link: greater weight loss leads to a larger increase in testosterone. For instance, a 15% body weight loss was associated with an approximate 7 nanomolar increase in testosterone, while a 15% weight gain was associated with about a 6 nanomolar decrease.
*   **Leanness as a Key Factor:** Collectively, these findings suggest that maintaining leanness and keeping body fat, visceral fat, and subcutaneous fat relatively low is a significant factor in resisting the age-related decline of testosterone.

## Association Between Body Mass Index (BMI) and Testosterone

One significant factor associated with testosterone levels is BMI. A BMI greater than 22.5 is associated with lower testosterone.

*   **Study 1 (12,000 men, 25-85 years, average age 60):**
    *   Men with BMIs less than 22.4 had the highest levels of testosterone.
    *   As BMI increased from 22.5 and higher, testosterone levels significantly decreased.
    *   For men in the 22.5-24.9 BMI category, average testosterone was 17.6 nanomolar.
    *   For men with a BMI of 37 or higher, average testosterone was significantly lower at 11.4 nanomolar.
*   **Study 2 (16,000 men, 40-70 years, average age 55):**
    *   This study confirmed similar associations.
    *   Men in the lowest quintile of BMI had the highest testosterone levels.
    *   As BMI increased across quintiles, testosterone levels were significantly lower.

## Body Fat Percentage and Testosterone

Beyond BMI, a higher body fat percentage is also associated with lower testosterone.

*   **Study (approximately 16,000 men):**
    *   Men in the lowest quintile for whole body fat percentage had the highest levels of testosterone.
    *   As whole body fat percentage increased, testosterone levels significantly decreased.

## Visceral and Subcutaneous Fat and Testosterone

Body fat can be further subdivided into visceral fat (surrounding organs) and subcutaneous fat (located just below the skin). Both types of fat are associated with testosterone levels.

*   **Visceral Fat:**
    *   Men with the lowest levels of visceral fat (first quintile) had the highest levels of testosterone.
    *   As visceral fat increased, testosterone levels significantly decreased.
*   **Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue (Abdominal):**
    *   Men with the lowest levels of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue had the highest levels of testosterone.
    *   As abdominal subcutaneous fat increased, testosterone levels significantly decreased.

These data from multiple studies collectively indicate that higher BMIs, higher body fat percentage, higher visceral fat, and higher abdominal subcutaneous fat are all associated with lower testosterone. This suggests that maintaining leanness and low body fat may be crucial for resisting age-related testosterone decline.

## Impact of Weight Loss/Gain on Testosterone (Causation)

While the above data show associations, it's important to investigate whether weight loss can causally increase testosterone.

*   **Longitudinal Study (4 years, 2,700 men, 40-79 years):**
    *   The greater the weight loss, the larger the testosterone increase.
    *   Men who lost 15% of their starting body weight experienced an increase of about 7 nanomolar in testosterone.
    *   Conversely, the greater the weight gain, the significantly lower the testosterone level.
    *   Men who gained 15% of their body weight experienced about a 6 nanomolar decrease in testosterone.

These data collectively suggest that leanness is a significant factor in helping to resist the age-related decline for testosterone, with a direct impact demonstrated by weight changes.
