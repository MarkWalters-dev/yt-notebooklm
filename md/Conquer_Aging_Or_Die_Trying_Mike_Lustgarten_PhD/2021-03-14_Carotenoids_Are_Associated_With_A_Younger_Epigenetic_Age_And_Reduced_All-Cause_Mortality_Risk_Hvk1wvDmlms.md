# 2021-03-14 Carotenoids Are Associated With A Younger Epigenetic Age And Reduced All-Cause Mortality Risk

**Executive Summary**
*   Higher total blood carotenoid levels are negatively correlated with DNA methylation GrimAge (a measure of epigenetic age), meaning higher levels are associated with a younger epigenetic age. This correlation holds for individual carotenoids: lycopene, alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lutein + zeaxanthin, and beta-cryptoxanthin.
*   GrimAge significantly outperforms other epigenetic clocks (Horvath, Hanum, Levin's PhenoAge) in predicting age-related clinical phenotypes and all-cause mortality risk, with an older GrimAge indicating a 91% increased risk of all-cause mortality.
*   Higher total blood carotenoid levels are independently associated with a lower all-cause mortality risk in meta-analyses, a trend also observed for alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, and lycopene. Lutein and zeaxanthin did not show a significant association in limited studies.
*   Personal blood test data shows a significant positive correlation between average daily beta-carotene intake and serum albumin levels.
*   Albumin is a crucial biomarker of biological age, included in multiple biological age predictors, and higher levels are associated with youth and consistently linked to reduced all-cause mortality risk, even in the oldest old (85-105+ years).

## Carotenoids and Epigenetic Age

Blood levels of total carotenoids are negatively correlated with DNA methylation GrimAge (DNAm GrimAge). This indicates that higher blood levels of carotenoids are associated with a younger epigenetic age. This finding is based on a study of approximately 2,300 subjects and is statistically significant.

Carotenoids are a group of five main metabolites. The data for each individual carotenoid also shows a significant negative correlation with GrimAge:
*   Lycopene
*   Alpha-carotene
*   Beta-carotene
*   Lutein + Zeaxanthin
*   Beta-cryptoxanthin

This means that higher blood levels of each of these individual carotenoids are associated with a younger epigenetic age. While these are currently only correlations and not randomized controlled trials, optimizing intake of these food-derived metabolites presents a potentially low-risk, high-reward strategy for influencing epigenetic age.

## Food Sources of Carotenoids

To support a younger epigenetic age, incorporating carotenoid-rich foods is recommended. Specific food sources for various carotenoids include:

*   **Alpha-carotene:**
    *   Carrots, pumpkin, winter squash, plantains, collard greens.
    *   *Example Intake:* An average of 416 grams/day of carrots provides about 15 mg/day of alpha-carotene.
*   **Beta-carotene:**
    *   Carrots, leafy greens, orange sweet potato, cantaloupe, pumpkin.
    *   *Example Intake:* Carrots are a predominant source.
*   **Lycopene:**
    *   Tomatoes, watermelon, papaya, grapefruit.
    *   *Example Intake:* 134 grams/day of watermelon provides about 5-7 mg/day of lycopene.
*   **Lutein and Zeaxanthin:**
    *   Leafy greens, summer and winter squash, Brussels sprouts, yellow corn.
    *   *Example Intake:* Spinach and broccoli provide approximately 25-30 mg/day of lutein plus zeaxanthin.
*   **Beta-cryptoxanthin:**
    *   Pumpkin, papaya, red bell peppers, sweet peppers, orange, carrots.
    *   *Example Intake:* Red bell pepper intake provides about 2 mg/day of beta-cryptoxanthin.

## GrimAge: A Predictor of All-Cause Mortality

GrimAge is a robust epigenetic clock for predicting all-cause mortality risk. A study titled "GrimAge outperforms other epigenetic clocks in the prediction of age related clinical phenotypes and all cause mortality" compared various epigenetic clocks:
*   Horvath's clock (best for chronological age)
*   Hanum clock
*   Levin's PhenoAge methylation clock
*   GrimAge

Among these, GrimAge was the only methylation epigenetic clock that identified a significant association between an older epigenetic age and an increased all-cause mortality risk. An older GrimAge indicated a 91% increased risk (Hazard Ratio: 1.91) for all-cause mortality.

## Carotenoids and All-Cause Mortality Risk

Higher blood levels of carotenoids are directly associated with a lower all-cause mortality risk.

*   **Total Carotenoids:**
    *   A meta-analysis of seven studies showed that higher blood levels of total carotenoids are associated with a lower risk for all-cause mortality. This relationship appeared linear, with continued reductions in risk up to approximately 180 milligrams per deciliter of blood carotenoids, compared to lower levels (e.g., 20 mg/dL).
*   **Individual Carotenoids:**
    *   **Beta-carotene:** A meta-analysis of eight studies indicated a significant decrease in all-cause mortality risk for higher blood levels of beta-carotene, compared to lower levels (e.g., 10 mg/dL).
    *   **Alpha-carotene:** Higher blood levels were associated with lower all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Beta-cryptoxanthin:** Higher blood levels were associated with lower all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Lycopene:** Higher blood levels were associated with lower all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Lutein and Zeaxanthin:** In two studies, these carotenoids were not significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk, possibly due to a limited number of studies.

## Carotenoids and Clinical Biomarkers

There is a link between carotenoid intake and clinical biomarkers, specifically serum albumin.

Data from 28 blood tests (2015-2021) showed a significant positive correlation (p=0.008, correlation coefficient = 0.6) between higher average daily beta-carotene intake and higher serum albumin levels.

**Importance of Albumin as a Biomarker:**
Albumin is an important biomarker of biological age, identified by statistical analysis in four separate predictors of biological age:
*   Levin's Phenotypic Age
*   Aging.ai
*   A calorie restriction randomized controlled trial
*   Waziri (2039 study)

Higher levels of albumin are associated with youth and decline during aging. A study of over 1,000,000 subjects found higher albumin levels in younger individuals and lower levels in advanced ages.

Furthermore, higher albumin levels are associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk, even in the oldest old (85-105+ years). In a study examining clinically relevant biomarkers (HDL, LDL, Hemoglobin A1c, Creatinine/eGFR, C-reactive protein, Albumin) across various age groups (85-99 years, 100-104 years, >105 years), albumin was the only biomarker consistently and significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk at every age. Higher albumin levels were linked to:
*   27% reduction in all-cause mortality risk for 85-99 year olds.
*   26% reduction for 100-104 year olds.
*   34% reduction for those older than 105 years.

This suggests that higher albumin levels are associated with a lower mortality risk even at the extremes of lifespan.

**Summary of Proposed Mechanisms:**

Carotenoid-rich Foods
-> Increased Blood Levels of Carotenoids
-> Younger Epigenetic Age (DNAm GrimAge)
-> Reduced All-Cause Mortality Risk

Carotenoid-rich Foods (e.g., Beta-carotene)
-> Increased Serum Albumin Levels
-> Reduced All-Cause Mortality Risk

Considering these data, including carotenoid-rich foods in the diet appears to be a wise strategy for supporting a younger epigenetic age and reducing all-cause mortality risk.
