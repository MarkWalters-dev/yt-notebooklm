# 2021-11-08 Quantifying Biological Age - Blood Test 5 in 2021

## Executive Summary

*   Two blood-based biological age calculators, Morgan Levine's Phenotypic Age Calculator and aging.ai, were used, yielding biological ages of 37.1 years and 30 years respectively.
*   The author's calculated biological ages are significantly younger than their chronological age (approximately 12 and 19 years younger).
*   Cardiovascular health metrics (resting heart rate and heart rate variability) showed a negative trend between blood tests but were not found to be significantly correlated with biological age in the author's data.
*   Dietary intake includes significant amounts of carotenoid-rich foods (carrots, red bell pepper, watermelon, tomato, lettuce, spinach) and berries (strawberries, blueberries, blackberries).
*   Calorie intake was approximately 7% restricted compared to the author's average intake since 2015, with macronutrient distribution of 44% fat, 40% carbohydrates, and 17% protein.

## Biological Age Calculations

### Morgan Levine's Phenotypic Age Calculator

*   **Biological Age:** 37.1 years
*   **Chronological Age Difference:** ~12 years younger

### aging.ai

*   **Biological Age:** 30 years
*   **Chronological Age Difference:** ~19 years younger

## Factors Potentially Contributing to Youthful Biological Age

### Supplements

*   **Levothyroxine:** Taken daily due to a hypothyroidism diagnosis over 20 years ago.
*   **No other supplements:** Including NAD boosters, rapamycin, or B12 were taken during the period of this blood test.

### Fitness and Body Composition Stats (59-day period prior to blood test)

*   **Body Weight:** 155.6 lbs (a decrease from the previous blood test, consistent with mild caloric restriction).
*   **Resting Heart Rate (RHR):** 46.5 bpm (a slight increase from the previous blood test).
*   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** 53.5 milliseconds (a decrease from the previous blood test).

### Diet Composition

*   **Daily Food Ranking by Grams/Ounces:**
    1.  **Carrots:** Rich in alpha and beta carotene.
    2.  **Strawberries:** Rich in fisetin.
    3.  **Red Bell Pepper:** Good source of beta cryptoxanthin.
    4.  **Watermelon & Tomato:** Sources of lycopene.
    5.  **Lettuce & Spinach:** Sources of lutein and zeaxanthin.
    *   **Note:** These are all significant sources of carotenoids, which are correlated with younger epigenetic age.
    *   **Other Berries:** Blueberries and blackberries are consumed regularly and are sources of curaminin (a CD38 inhibitor).
    *   **Parsley:** Consumed in significant amounts (49g/day), containing Apigenin (a CD38 inhibitor).
    *   **Importance of CD38 Inhibitors:** May slow age-related NAD decline by inhibiting CD38, which degrades NAD.
    *   **Remaining 19 Foods:** Consumed in amounts less than 10 grams per day.

### Calorie and Macronutrient Intake

*   **Average Daily Calorie Intake:** 2399 calories
*   **Calorie Restriction:** Approximately 7% less than the author's average intake since April 2015 (2586 calories). This could be up to 15% restricted compared to the highest average intake (2800 calories).
*   **Macronutrient Distribution (% of Calories):**
    *   **Fat:** 44%
    *   **Carbohydrates:** 40%
    *   **Protein:** 17%
*   **Specific Notes:**
    *   **Omega-6 Intake:** Approximately 7 grams per day, one of the lowest intakes recorded. This was a purposeful reduction to observe its effect on homocysteine.
    *   **Total Fructose Intake:** Approximately 67 grams per day, the lowest intake over the past six years. This was a purposeful reduction due to observed correlations between higher fructose intake, lower HDL, and higher C-reactive protein.

### Micronutrient Intake

*   **Vitamins:**
    *   **RDA Coverage:** Achieved for all vitamins except Vitamin D.
    *   **Vitamin D:** Approximately half of the RDA (800 IU/day) from supplementation, supplemented with sunlight exposure in summer.
    *   **25-hydroxy Vitamin D Blood Level:** 40 ng/mL. A meta-analysis of 95 studies (over 880,000 subjects) indicated that a level greater than 30 ng/mL is associated with the lowest risk for all-cause mortality.
*   **Minerals:**
    *   **RDA Coverage:** Achieved for all minerals.
    *   **Higher Intake:** Potassium and selenium intake are purposefully higher.

## Correlation of Cardiovascular Metrics with Biological Age

*   **Data Duration:** Over 1100 days of data (since August 2018) corresponding to 15 blood tests.
*   **Analysis:** Resting heart rate (RHR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were compared against biological age calculated by aging.ai and Levine's Phenotypic Age.
*   **Findings:**
    *   **aging.ai vs. RHR:** No significant correlation.
    *   **aging.ai vs. HRV:** No significant correlation.
    *   **Levine's Phenotypic Age vs. RHR:** No significant correlation (based on 13 blood tests).
    *   **Levine's Phenotypic Age vs. HRV:** No significant correlation (based on 13 blood tests).
*   **Conclusion:** In the author's personal data, biological age does not appear to be significantly correlated with resting heart rate or heart rate variability, despite a recent negative trend in these metrics coinciding with a slight increase in biological age.
