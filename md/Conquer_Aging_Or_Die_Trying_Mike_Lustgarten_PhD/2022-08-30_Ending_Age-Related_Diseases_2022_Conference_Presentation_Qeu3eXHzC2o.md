# 2022-08-30 Ending Age-Related Diseases 2022 Conference Presentation

## Executive Summary

*   **Significant Biological Age Reduction:** The presenter has consistently reduced his biological age, achieving a 16.8-year reduction (PhenoAge) and a 21.4-year reduction (Aging.ai) compared to his chronological age of 49.4 years, based on personal biomarker tracking. Average biological age has trended downwards from 35.6 years in 2020 to 32.2 years in 2022 (PhenoAge) and from 32 years (2009-2013) to 28.5 years (2022) (Aging.ai).
*   **Validation of At-Home Blood Testing:** At-home dry blood spot testing for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HS-CRP) demonstrated comparable or even superior sensitivity to standard venipuncture lab tests, suggesting its potential as a reliable and convenient method for frequent biomarker monitoring.
*   **Personalized Diet-Biomarker Optimization Methodology:** A precise nutrition approach involves daily weighing and logging of all food intake into Cronometer, transferring data to a spreadsheet, computing average intake over a 63-day period preceding blood tests, and then correlating individual food intake with a panel of 24 "big picture biomarkers" to optimize dietary choices.
*   **Food-Specific Biomarker Correlations:** Specific foods show significant correlations with key health biomarkers. For example, higher strawberry intake is associated with lower AST, LDL, platelets, and HS-CRP. Beets demonstrated a strong positive net correlative score (plus eight), linked to lower Aging.ai age, AST, creatinine, glucose, LDL, neutrophils, and platelets, and higher lymphocyte percentage.

## Personal Biological Age Tracking

The presenter tracks biological age using two calculators: Dr. Morgan Levine's Phenotypic Age (PhenoAge) and Aging.ai 3.0.

**PhenoAge Results (July 11, 2022):**
*   **Biological Age:** 32.6 years
*   **Reduction:** 16.8 years younger than chronological age (49.4 years)
*   **Biomarkers:** Nine component biomarkers and chronological age are entered into the calculator.

**At-Home Blood Biomarker Testing for HS-CRP:**
To facilitate more frequent biomarker tracking, the presenter investigated at-home dry blood spot testing for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HS-CRP).

**Methodology for At-Home Test Validation:**
1.  **Standard Venipuncture:** Blood test performed at a Quest lab at 7:30 AM, fasted. HS-CRP result: < 0.3 mg/L.
2.  **At-Home Dry Blood Spot Test:** Performed approximately one hour later, still fasted, using a finger prick.
3.  **Comparison:** The at-home test's sensitivity for HS-CRP was reported as < 0.2 mg/L, indicating it is as good as, if not better than, venipuncture for detecting HS-CRP.

**Adjusted PhenoAge with At-Home HS-CRP Data:**
Using the more precise HS-CRP value (< 0.2 mg/L) from the at-home test, the PhenoAge calculation was updated:
*   **Biological Age:** 32.2 years
*   **Reduction:** 17 years younger than chronological age.

## Biological Age Over Time

**PhenoAge Trends (2020-2022):**
*   **2020 (6 tests):** Average biological age = 35.6 years
*   **2021 (6 tests):** Average biological age = 35.6 years
*   **2022 (first 4 tests):** Average biological age = 33.9 years
    *   Prior to 2022 (over 15 tests from 2018-2021), the average biological age reduction was approximately 12 years relative to chronological age.
    *   In 2022, the average reduction increased to 15.2 years, representing a further 3-year reduction.
*   **Limitation of PhenoAge:** This model includes chronological age, which limits the maximum possible biological age reduction. For example, if biomarkers remain youthful at age 80, the PhenoAge would still be 59, which the presenter views as a limitation.

**Aging.ai 3.0 Trends (2009-2022):**
Aging.ai does not include chronological age in its model, allowing for greater potential biological age reductions. It uses 19 component biomarkers, primarily from standard chem, lipid, and CBC panels.
*   **July 11, 2022 (1 test):** Biological age = 28 years (21.4 years younger than chronological)
*   **2009-2013 (3 tests):** Average biological age = 32 years
*   **2016-2021 (27 tests):** Average biological age = 29.9 years
*   **2022 (first 4 tests):** Average biological age = 28.5 years

The presenter believes further significant reductions beyond the current range are unlikely, with the goal being to maintain these youthful biomarker values indefinitely.

## Lifestyle Factors Influencing Biological Age

### Supplements

*   **Levothyroxine:** 137.5 micrograms/day for hypothyroidism (taken for half of the presenter's life).
*   **Vitamin D:** 1000 IU/day (8-9 months of the year, due to living in Boston; 80% compliance during the 63-day period of the latest blood test).
*   **Melatonin:** Approximately 39 micrograms/day (occasional, for sleep optimization).
*   **Other:** No other geroprotectors or senolytics. Methyl B12 was taken in the past but stopped for some 2022 blood tests.

### Diet Tracking Methodology

The presenter employs a detailed, personalized nutrition approach to optimize blood biomarkers.
1.  **Identify Blood Test Period:** For the July 11 blood test, the relevant dietary intake period was 63 days (from the previous blood test on May 9 to July 10).
2.  **Daily Food Weighing & Logging:** Since April 2015, all food is weighed and recorded daily into the Cronometer app.
3.  **Data Transfer:** Daily Cronometer data is transferred to a personal Excel spreadsheet.
4.  **Average Intake Calculation:** The average daily intake for the 63-day period is computed.
5.  **Correlation Analysis:** With sufficient data for both diet composition and blood biomarkers (up to 23 blood tests for individual foods since 2018), correlations are investigated.
6.  **Diet Modification:** Based on significant correlations, dietary intake (and potentially supplements) is modified with the goal of optimizing blood biomarkers. This is described as a precision nutrition approach.

### Food-Specific Biomarker Correlations

The presenter analyzes individual food intake against a panel of 24 "big picture biomarkers," including glucose, homocysteine, kidney/liver function markers, lipoproteins, immune cells, globulin, red blood cell measures, HS-CRP, and biological age scores (PhenoAge, Aging.ai).

*   **Correlation Scoring:**
    *   **Green Arrow:** Significant correlation in the "right" direction (towards younger/healthier biomarker levels or lower all-cause mortality risk).
    *   **Red Arrow:** Significant correlation in the "wrong" direction.
    *   **Net Correlative Score:** Sum of green arrows minus red arrows.
    *   **Action:**
        *   **Positive Score:** Eat above average intake.
        *   **Negative Score:** Eat below average intake.
        *   **Zero Score:** Eat at average intake.
    *   **Green Check:** Followed the correlation guidance.
    *   **Red X:** Did not follow the correlation guidance.

**Food Examples (63-day period for latest blood test):**

*   **Strawberries:**
    *   **Significant Correlations (Green Arrows):** Lower AST, LDL, platelets, HS-CRP (4 green arrows).
    *   **Net Correlative Score:** +4
    *   **Average Intake (since 2018):** 350 g/day
    *   **Intake for this test:** 622 g/day (Green Check - ate above average)
*   **Red Bell Peppers:**
    *   **Significant Correlations (Red Arrows):** Higher creatinine, higher neutrophils, lower lymphocyte percentage (3 red arrows - all aging-associated trends).
    *   **Net Correlative Score:** -3
    *   **Average Intake (since 2018):** 298 g/day
    *   **Intake for this test:** 0 g/day (Green Check - ate below average)

    *   **Significant Correlations (Green Arrows):** Lower homocysteine.
    *   **Net Correlative Score:** +1
    *   **Average Intake (since 2018):** 372 g/day
    *   **Intake for this test:** 206 g/day (Red X - did not eat above average, a decision related to beta-carotene levels).
*   **Mushrooms:**
    *   **Significant Correlations (Green Arrows):** Lower alkaline phosphatase, AST, CRP, LDL, platelets (5 green arrows).
    *   **Significant Correlations (Red Arrows):** Higher homocysteine (1 red arrow).
    *   **Net Correlative Score:** +4
    *   **Average Intake (since 2018):** Low (after previous period of high intake)
    *   **Intake for this test:** 231 g/day (Green Check - ate above average)
*   **Beets:**
    *   **Significant Correlations (Green Arrows):** Lower Aging.ai age, AST, creatinine, glucose, LDL, neutrophils, platelets, higher lymphocyte percentage (8 green arrows).
    *   **Net Correlative Score:** +8
    *   **Average Intake (since 2018):** 115 g/day
    *   **Intake for this test:** 206 g/day (Green Check - ate above average)
*   **Collard Greens:**
    *   **Significant Correlations (Green Arrows):** Lower LDL (1 green arrow).
    *   **Net Correlative Score:** +1
    *   **Average Intake (since 2018):** Very low (recent switch from spinach due to oxalates).
    *   **Intake for this test:** 88 g/day (Green Check - ate above average)
*   **Watermelon:**
    *   **Net Correlative Score:** +5
    *   **Average Intake (since 2018):** 152 g/day
    *   **Intake for this test:** 200 g/day (Green Check - ate above average)

This correlative approach is also applied to macronutrients and micronutrients to achieve an optimized biomarker profile.

## Q&A Highlights

*   **Photo Age:** The presenter has not yet measured photo age, noting potential impacts from lighting and sleep. Skin aging is considered a challenging area to optimize, as it can appear old even with optimized internal biochemistry.
*   **Alcohol Consumption:** The presenter does not consume alcohol due to:
    1.  Negative impact on cardiovascular metrics (heart rate variability, resting heart rate) observed via fitness tracker.
    2.  Reported negative effects on sleep quality (increasing light sleep, decreasing REM/slow-wave sleep).
    3.  Alcohol is not nutrient-dense; grapes (the whole food) would be a more beneficial alternative.
    4.  No evidence suggesting alcohol would further improve the presenter's already optimized biomarker data or cardiovascular metrics. The presenter encourages objective tracking for individuals to assess alcohol's impact on their own health.
*   **Other Physiologic Markers:**
    *   **Cardiovascular Metrics:** Heart rate variability (HRV) and resting heart rate (RHR) are consistently tracked and have reached personal bests.
    *   **Strength:** Workouts are highly standardized (same sets, reps, weight) to allow for objective monitoring of strength. Strength has been maintained or increased over the past 3-4 years.
    *   **Other Markers (To-do list):** Lung volume (FEV) is considered.
    *   **New Tracking Areas:** Oral microbiome analysis has been initiated, as blood biomarkers may not capture changes in oral microbes linked to conditions like plaque formation or Alzheimer's disease. The approach is continuously expanding to avoid missing critical health indicators.
*   **Albumin Levels:**
    *   **Importance:** Albumin remains a crucial biomarker due to its abundance in blood, its decline with aging, its association with increased all-cause mortality risk at low levels, and its link to decreased physical function. It is included in biological age calculators.
    *   **Optimal Range:** While high albumin levels are generally associated with youth, the presenter's data suggests that even within the reference range (e.g., 5.2-5.4 g/dL), levels can be "too high" when analyzed against the broader "big picture biomarkers." The presenter aims to maintain albumin levels more narrowly around 4.8-4.9 g/dL.
    *   **Beta-carotene Correlation:** Beta-carotene intake is strongly correlated with albumin levels in the presenter's data, though this correlation is not universal across all individuals.
