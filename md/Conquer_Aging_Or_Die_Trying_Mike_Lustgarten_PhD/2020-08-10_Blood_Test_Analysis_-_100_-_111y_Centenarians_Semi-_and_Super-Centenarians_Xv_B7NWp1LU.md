# 2020-08-10 Blood Test Analysis - 100 - 111y Centenarians Semi- and Super-Centenarians

## Executive Summary

*   **Longevity Bias:** Females significantly outnumber males in extreme longevity cohorts; only 9% of supercentenarians (110+) are male.
*   **Optimal White Blood Cell Count:** A White Blood Cell (WBC) count between 3,500–6,000 cells/µL is associated with a life expectancy advantage of approximately 38 years (compared to 30 years for those in the 6,000–10,000 range). Centenarians generally fall within this optimal range.
*   **Albumin Decline:** Albumin levels show a consistent age-related decrease, dropping from approximately 4.2 in younger groups to 3.2 in supercentenarians. Higher albumin levels (>4.4 for women, >4.5 for men) are strongly associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Inflammation Increase:** Key inflammatory markers (CRP and IL-6) consistently increase across all age groups studied, from the 75-year-olds up to the 111-year-olds.
*   **CMV Prevalence:** Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (active or previous) is nearly universal in this long-lived cohort, with prevalence rates exceeding 98% in the oldest groups.

## Study Cohort Overview

The analysis examines blood test data across several distinct, long-lived groups, contrasting them with younger control groups:

| Group | Age Range (Years) | Sample Size (N) | Average Age (Years) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Centenarian Offspring/Spouses | ~75 | N/A (Combined) | ~75 |
| Community Dwelling Controls | 85–99 | 536 | ~87 |
| Centenarians | 100–104 | 275 | ~101 |
| Semi-Centenarians | 105–109 | 387 | ~107 |
| Supercentenarians | 110+ | 22 | ~111 |

**Gender Distribution in Longevity Groups:**
The probability of reaching extreme ages is significantly higher for females:

*   100–104 Years: 88% Female / 12% Male
*   105–109 Years: 88% Female / 12% Male
*   110+ Years: 91% Female / 9% Male

## Blood Biomarker Analysis

### White Blood Cells (WBC)

**Centenarian Data:**
WBC counts generally remained within the standard reference range, except for the supercentenarian group, which averaged approximately 6,300 cells/µL.

**Longitudinal Optimization Data (Baltimore Study):**
Analysis tracking subjects over 40 years showed a clear link between baseline WBC count and average remaining life expectancy at age 50:

*   WBC 3,500–6,000 cells/µL: $\approx 38$ years life expectancy
*   WBC 6,001–10,000 cells/µL: $\approx 30$ years life expectancy
*   WBC > 10,000 cells/µL: $\approx 25$ years life expectancy

**Conclusion:** The range of 3,500–6,000 WBCs/µL is optimal for longevity, a range where most centenarian groups fall. (Note: Neutrophils increase with age, while lymphocytes decrease.)

### Red Blood Cells (RBC) and Hemoglobin

**Age-Related Change:**
RBC counts and corresponding Hemoglobin levels showed a consistent decrease with advancing age across the lifespan, decreasing from $\approx 4.8$ (men) and $\approx 4.3$ (women) in younger groups down to $\approx 3.9$ in the 90+ age brackets. Hemoglobin dropped from the low 13s down into the low-to-mid 11s in centenarians.

**All-Cause Mortality Risk (Hemoglobin):**
*   **Men:** Levels below 13 are associated with increased mortality risk. Centenarian men with levels in the 11s face a higher risk.
*   **Women:** Levels below 11 are associated with increased mortality risk. Centenarian women with levels in the 11s are borderline in terms of risk elevation.

**Conclusion:** The data suggests room for improvement in RBC/Hemoglobin metrics for this elderly cohort.

### Platelets

**Age-Related Change:**
Platelet counts show a slight age-related decrease, moving from the 215–219 range (in $10^3/\mu L$) in the 70-year-olds down to the 189–193 range in centenarians. This observed decrease is steeper than that reported in some large cross-sectional studies of younger adults.

**All-Cause Mortality Risk:**
The lowest all-cause mortality risk is associated with platelet values in the 200–300 range.
*   Values below 200 show increased risk.
*   Values below 100 show a substantial 93% increased risk relative to the reference group (which has an 8% risk).

**Conclusion:** Centenarian platelet counts are slightly below the optimal range but not critically low (i.e., not below 100).

### Total Cholesterol (TC)

**Age-Related Change:**
TC levels generally decrease in this very old population compared to younger groups (e.g., dropping from $\approx 200–210$ in the 80s to $\approx 156$ in supercentenarians). This pattern confirms prior observations that TC levels increase with age up to a certain point, after which they decline.

**Mortality Risk:**
The lower TC values observed in the centenarian groups trend toward levels associated with increased all-cause mortality risk at younger ages.

### HDL Cholesterol

**Age-Related Change:**
HDL levels remained relatively stable in the 50s until age 105, after which they dropped to the 44–45 range for semi- and supercentenarians.

**Cardiovascular Mortality Risk:**
*   **Men:** A drop in HDL from the 50s to the 40s showed no significant increase in risk of death from cardiovascular issues or other causes.
*   **Women:** A drop in HDL from the 50s to the 40s showed a small, but measurable, increase in risk for cardiovascular and other deaths, though this risk was significantly lower than the risk associated with HDL levels in the 30s.

### Albumin

Albumin is highlighted as a potentially underrated biomarker for biological age prediction.

**Age-Related Change:**
Albumin levels showed a clear, steady decrease with age:
$$
\text{Younger Groups } (\approx 4.2) \quad \rightarrow \quad \text{Supercentenarians } (\approx 3.2)
$$
This decrease follows the general trend seen in large population studies ($\text{N} > 1$ million).

**All-Cause Mortality Risk:**
*   Higher albumin is strongly linked to lower all-cause mortality.
*   **Optimal Thresholds:** >4.5 (Men) and >4.4 (Women) are associated with the lowest risk.

**Conclusion:** The albumin levels in centenarians are not optimal based on mortality risk data, though this biomarker is noted as potentially malleable through dietary intervention.

### Kidney Function (Creatinine)

**Age-Related Change:**
Creatinine levels remained largely within the reference range, showing no severe elevation expected from age-related kidney function decline alone.

**Interpretation of Creatinine:**
Creatinine levels are confounded by muscle mass:
$$\text{Decreased Kidney Function} \rightarrow \text{Increased Creatinine}$$
$$\text{Decreased Muscle Mass} \rightarrow \text{Decreased Creatinine}$$
The observed near-stability suggests these two opposing age-related forces may be washing each other out. Further investigation using other kidney function measures is recommended.

**All-Cause Mortality Risk:**
The centenarian groups fall within the 0.6–1.1 mg/dL range, which is associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality.

### Inflammation

Inflammatory markers (C-Reactive Protein [CRP], Interleukin-6 [IL-6], and TNF-alpha) were examined.

**Age-Related Change:**
All three markers consistently increased from the 70-year-old groups up to the 111-year-old supercentenarians.

**Mortality Association:**
*   **IL-6:** Higher levels are associated with a 49% increase in all-cause mortality risk compared to lower levels.
*   **CRP & IL-6:** These markers show more established associations with increased all-cause mortality risk across studies.
*   **TNF-alpha:** Data is more variable; associations with mortality risk were sometimes inconsistent or only observed in men.

### Cytomegalovirus (CMV)

CMV (HHV-5) infection status was nearly 100% across the entire centenarian spectrum:

| Group | CMV Prevalence |
| :--- | :--- |
| 70s Group | 97.6% |
| Supercentenarians | $\approx 100\%$ |

**Age-Related Prevalence:** CMV infection prevalence rises sharply with age, reaching over 90% in adults over 80.

**Potential Mechanism Link:**
Infection of endothelial cells with CMV resulted in significantly decreased levels of the anti-aging protein SIRT1.
$$\text{CMV Infection} \quad \rightarrow \quad \downarrow \text{SIRT1 Protein Levels}$$
