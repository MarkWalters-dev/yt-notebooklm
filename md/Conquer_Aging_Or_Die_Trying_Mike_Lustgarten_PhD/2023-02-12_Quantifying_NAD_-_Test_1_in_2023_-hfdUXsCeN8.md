# 2023-02-12 Quantifying NAD - Test 1 in 2023

## Executive Summary

*   Intracellular NAD levels significantly decline with age, decreasing from an average of 44 micromolar in individuals under 20 years old to 27 micromolar in those aged 55-90.
*   The speaker's current intracellular NAD level is 25.6 micromolar, which is categorized as "deficient" and is comparable to levels typically found in individuals aged 55-90.
*   This low NAD level is unexpected given the speaker's consistent, high intake of niacin (41 mg/day, 2.5 times the RDA) and apigenin (106 mg/day, a dose sufficient to significantly inhibit NAD-degrading enzyme CD38).
*   Despite the low NAD, the speaker exhibits a youthful biological age (17-22 years younger than chronological age) based on established biomarkers like Levine's PhenoAge and aging.ai.
*   A new supplementation protocol has begun with 300 mg/day of NMN to test if NAD levels can be increased, with a specific interest in potential improvements to DHEA sulfate levels (which require NADPH, a phosphorylated form of NAD) and other biological age markers.

## NAD Decline with Age

NAD levels decline during aging. In youth, NAD levels are relatively high, whereas in advanced age, they are relatively low. This is important because NAD impacts the health and/or function of many organ systems, including the brain and nervous system, liver, vasculature, and heart.

Specific data from Ginfinity, based on 116 subjects, demonstrates this age-related decline:

*   **Younger than 20 years old:** Average intracellular NAD is 44 micromolar.
*   **20 to 30 year olds:** Average NAD level is 34 micromolar (significantly lower than <20).
*   **30 to 55 year olds:** Average NAD level is 29 micromolar (significantly lower than 20-30).
*   **55 to 90 year olds:** Average NAD level is 27 micromolar (not significantly different from 30-55, p > 0.05).

Comparing broader age groups, people younger than 30 had an average NAD level of 42 micromolar, while people older than 30 had an average NAD level of 28 micromolar. These data are significantly different, indicating that people younger than 30 have about a 33% higher level of intracellular NAD compared to people older than 30 years.

Ginfinity's data for people younger than 20 suggests that 40 to 50 micromolar may be an optimal NAD range.

## Personal NAD Levels and Categories

The Ginfinity intracellular NAD assay was used to measure levels. The speaker's intracellular NAD concentration, for all blood cells, is 25.6 micromolar.

According to Ginfinity's categories:
*   **Deficient:** 20 to 30 micromolar
*   **Optimal:** 40 to 100 micromolar

Based on this, the speaker's NAD level of 25.6 micromolar falls into the "deficient" category. For a chronological age of 50 years, this places the speaker in the age category of 30-55 year olds, or even closer to the 55-90 year old group, in terms of intracellular NAD levels.

## Factors Influencing NAD: Niacin and Apigenin

The speaker's relatively low or "aged" NAD levels are surprising given consistent, high intake of niacin and apigenin.

### NAD Production Pathways

NAD concentration is impacted by several pathways:
*   **Nicotinic Acid (NA) Pathway:**
    Nicotinic Acid (NA) -> [3 enzymatic steps] -> NAD
*   **Niacinamide (NAM) Pathway:**
    Niacinamide (NAM) -> NMN -> [2 enzymatic steps] -> NAD

Both nicotinic acid and niacinamide are forms of Vitamin B3 (niacin).

### Niacin Intake

The speaker has tracked dietary intake daily since 2015. Since January 2022, the average daily niacin intake has been 41 milligrams per day. This is approximately two and a half-fold higher than the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of 16 milligrams per day, and this intake level has been consistent for at least the past 13 months. Therefore, the speaker is not niacin deficient.

### NAD Degradation and Apigenin

NAD can be degraded into NAM, partly by the action of the enzyme CD38. CD38 activity can be inhibited by food components, including apigenin.

Data shows that at about 50 micromolar of apigenin, CD38 activity is approximately 85% inhibited. Furthermore, 25 micromolar apigenin was sufficient to increase intracellular levels of NAD, leading to about a 75% increase in NAD levels above control in treated cells.

### Apigenin Intake

The speaker's primary source of apigenin is fresh parsley, which contains about 215 milligrams of apigenin per 100 grams (according to the USDA flavonoid database). The average parsley intake over the past year and a half has been 49 grams per day.

This results in an average daily apigenin intake of 106 milligrams per day. Assuming 100% absorption, this would yield a circulating blood concentration of 79 micromolar. Even with only 30% absorption from blood into cells, the resulting cellular concentration would still be close to the 25 micromolar needed to significantly inhibit CD38. Therefore, the speaker is likely not apigenin deficient.

## NAD and Biological Age

The relatively low NAD level (25.6 micromolar) is particularly surprising because the speaker's biological age data is consistently youthful. On the same day the NAD measurement was taken, biological age assessments showed:

*   **Levine's PhenoAge:** 17 years younger than chronological age.
*   **Aging.ai:** 22 years younger than chronological age.

This suggests that while NAD levels are low, other biological factors contribute to a youthful overall biological age.

## Hypothesis: NAD, NADPH, and DHEA

One biomarker that could potentially be improved by increasing NAD is DHEA. DHEA is the precursor metabolite for DHEA sulfate (DHES), which declines during aging. Low levels of DHES are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk. The speaker's DHES levels are low, indicating a potential weakness in the data.

The conversion of cholesterol into DHEA requires NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). NADPH is essentially NAD with a phosphate group (NAD phosphate).

**Cholesterol -> [5 enzymatic steps, all requiring NADPH] -> DHEA**

This raises the question: Is the relatively low NAD limiting DHEA production, and consequently DHEA sulfate levels?

## NMN Supplementation Protocol

To test the hypothesis regarding NAD, NADPH, and DHEA, a targeted NMN supplementation protocol has been initiated:

1.  **Step 1: Initial NMN Dose:** Begin with 300 milligrams per day of NMN (started approximately two weeks prior to this report). The primary goal is to determine if this amount of NMN is sufficient to increase NAD.
2.  **Step 2: First NAD Re-analysis:** Send blood for NAD analysis approximately one week after the initial NMN supplementation period to assess the impact of 300mg/day.
3.  **Step 3: Dose Adjustment (if needed):** If 300mg/day of NMN is not sufficient to raise NAD levels, the intake will be increased to around 600 milligrams per day, or potentially higher.
4.  **Step 4: Comprehensive Blood Panel:** A full blood panel will be conducted on March 6, 2023 (Test #2 in 2023). This test will measure:
    *   Intracellular NAD levels.
    *   All biomarkers required for Levine's PhenoAge and aging.ai.
    *   All three commonly used epigenetic tests.

The objective of this comprehensive testing is to observe if NMN supplementation impacts NAD levels and, hopefully, improves DHES levels or other identified weaknesses (e.g., homocysteine, Horvath's epigenetic clock), without negatively affecting other biomarkers.
