# 2025-01-22 Strategies To Rejuvenate The Immune System Clip

## Executive Summary
* Caloric restriction and dietary restriction have demonstrated efficacy in rejuvenating aspects of the immune system in both mouse models and human studies.
* Rapamycin shows some of the most promising pharmacological data for mitigating immunosenescence compared to agents like Metformin, which has limited human evidence.
* Aging hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can exhibit a myeloid skew, preferentially producing granulocytes over lymphocytes, contributing to chronic inflammation.
* Senolytic CAR T cells, programmed to target the senescence marker uPAR, have shown durable health benefits in mice, potentially including gut rejuvenation after a single infusion.

## Lifestyle Interventions
Lifestyle interventions have been tested across multiple species with positive results:
* Caloric Restriction (CR)
* Dietary Restriction (DR)

## Pharmacological Agents
Various drugs have been investigated for their effects on immunosenescence:

### Metformin
* Has shown potential to reduce some forms of immunosenescence, primarily in mouse models, with limited supportive data in humans.

### Rapamycin
* Represents the pharmacological intervention with some of the most robust data available for modulating age-related immune decline.

### Other Mouse Studies
* Testing of NAD+ supplementation.
* Use of mitophagy activators, such as urolithin A.

## Cellular Targeting Strategies (Mouse Data)

### PD-1 Inhibitors
* Agents that block PD-1 have been shown to benefit health and immune function in mouse models.

### Targeting Myeloid Bias in Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs)
Aging often causes an imbalance in HSC differentiation, leading to:

**Normal Hematopoiesis (Young):**
HSC $\rightarrow$ Lymphopoiesis (Lymphocyte Production)

**Aged Hematopoiesis (Myeloid Skew):**
HSC $\rightarrow$ Increased Granulocyte Production (Myeloid Bias)

This myeloid skew contributes to a hyperinflammatory state associated with aging. Antibodies targeting these myeloid-biased HSCs have shown health benefits in mouse studies.

### Advanced Cellular Therapies
Strategies involving direct cellular intervention have been successful in mice:
1. **Stem Cell Transplantation:** Using thymic progenitors.
2. **CAR T Cells Targeting Senescent Cells:**
    * CAR T cells are engineered to recognize the protein **uPAR** on the surface of senescent cells.
    * Studies by the labs of Karina Moore and Scott Lowe demonstrated that these senolytic CAR T cells effectively improve health in mice.
    * The effects are often durable, sometimes requiring only a single infusion.
    * Preliminary data suggests these senolytic CAR T cells may also promote rejuvenation in the gut tissue.
