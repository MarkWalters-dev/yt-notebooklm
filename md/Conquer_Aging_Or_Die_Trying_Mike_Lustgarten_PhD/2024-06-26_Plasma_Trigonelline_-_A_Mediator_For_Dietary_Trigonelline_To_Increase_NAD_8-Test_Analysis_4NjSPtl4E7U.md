# 2024-06-26 Plasma Trigonelline - A Mediator For Dietary Trigonelline To Increase NAD 8-Test Analysis

## Executive Summary

*   Trigonelline, also known as 1-methyl nicotinic acid, increases NAD levels in mice, with effects observed in whole blood, liver, and muscle at different time points after a force-feed.
*   Dietary intake of trigonelline-rich foods significantly increased plasma trigonelline levels in humans, with clover sprouts leading to a 24-fold increase over baseline.
*   Despite increased plasma trigonelline from dietary interventions, 8 human tests showed no significant correlation between plasma trigonelline levels and blood intracellular NAD levels.
*   A future 10-day experiment will investigate the impact of daily supplemental trigonelline (1 gram/day) on plasma trigonelline and blood intracellular NAD levels.

## Mouse Data

Trigonelline (1-methyl nicotinic acid) has been shown to increase NAD levels in mice.

### Whole Blood NAD Levels

*   Whole blood NAD levels increased two hours after a trigonelline force-feed.
*   NAD levels were not increased the next day.

### Tissue NAD Levels

To address concerns about whether blood NAD changes reflect tissue changes, liver and muscle NAD levels were evaluated.

*   **Liver:** Liver NAD levels were significantly increased two hours after the trigonelline force-feed but were not significantly increased the next day.
*   **Muscle (Gastrocnemius):** Muscle NAD levels were not significantly increased two hours after the trigonelline force-feed but were significantly increased the next day.

These data indicate that in mice, trigonelline increases NAD in whole blood and tissues, including the liver and muscle, with varying temporal dynamics.

## Human Evidence: Dietary Trigonelline & Plasma Levels

A key question is whether increased dietary trigonelline translates to increased plasma trigonelline, which is hypothesized to mediate NAD increases. Plasma trigonelline levels were measured using an at-home metabolomics kit.

### Dietary Intervention Protocol:

1.  **Baseline (5 tests, 2023-2024):** Normal diet, no special trigonelline-rich foods.
    *   Average plasma trigonelline: 0.29 micromolar (relatively low).
2.  **Fenugreek Seeds:**
    *   Added fenugreek seeds to the diet.
    *   Plasma trigonelline increased to approximately 1 micromolar (a ~3x increase).
3.  **Chickpeas & Alfalfa Sprouts:**
    *   Included chickpeas and alfalfa sprouts (reported to be trigonelline-rich).
    *   Plasma trigonelline further increased to approximately 2 micromolar (a ~7x increase over baseline).
4.  **Clover Sprouts:**
    *   Included clover sprouts, reported to have the highest trigonelline content among foods, including coffee.
    *   Plasma trigonelline increased to 6.9 micromolar (a ~24x increase over baseline).

The data indicate that plasma trigonelline levels can be significantly increased through dietary modifications.

## Human Evidence: Plasma Trigonelline & NAD Correlation

Eight human tests were conducted to investigate the correlation between plasma trigonelline and blood intracellular NAD levels. Blood intracellular NAD levels were measured.

The data showed no significant correlation between plasma trigonelline and blood intracellular NAD levels (p-value = 0.49, far greater than 0.05).

*   One data point showed high NAD due to 600 mg/day nicotinic acid intake, not trigonelline, and had relatively low trigonelline levels. This was not considered a trigonelline-induced outlier.
*   Even excluding this point, the correlation between plasma trigonelline and NAD appeared flat, particularly within the 0 to 2 micromolar range of plasma trigonelline.

The findings suggest that while diet can increase plasma trigonelline, the levels achieved through diet in this personal experiment were not high enough to significantly impact NAD levels.

## Future Experiments

A 10-day experiment is planned to investigate trigonelline supplementation.

### Supplemental Trigonelline Protocol:

1.  **Dosage:** 1 gram of supplemental trigonelline per day (500 mg twice daily, separated morning and evening).
    *   This represents a 10x increase over the highest estimated dietary intake (approximately 100 mg/day with clover sprouts).
2.  **Duration:** 10 days.
3.  **Measurements:** Blood intracellular NAD levels and metabolomic data will be collected after the 10-day period.

The aim is to determine if 1 gram of supplemental trigonelline can increase both plasma trigonelline and blood intracellular NAD levels. The human equivalent dose used in mouse studies was approximately 1.6 grams of trigonelline per day, suggesting potential for higher dosages if initial results are insufficient.
