# 2023-03-26 Blood Test 2 in 2023 - Diet Composition

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age assessments showed results 17 years younger (PhenoAge) and 23 years younger (aging.ai) than chronological age.
*   Daily NMN supplementation (average 340mg for 42 days, 1000mg for 7 days pre-test) did not dramatically improve or worsen biological age data compared to prior tests without NMN.
*   The average daily calorie intake was 2177 kcal/day over 42 days, marking the lowest average since diet tracking began in 2015.
*   Net macronutrient composition, after accounting for fiber conversion to fat, was approximately 43% fat, 40% net carbohydrates, and 17.5% protein.
*   The consistent diet composition, including micronutrient intake often exceeding RDA (e.g., Vitamin K at 17x RDA), is associated with consistently youthful biomarker data.

## Biological Age

For blood test number two in 2023, biological age, using Dr. Morgan Levine's PhenoAge, was 17 years younger than chronological age. Similarly, using aging.ai, biological age was 23 years younger than chronological age.

## Supplements

*   **NMN:** An average intake of 340 mg/day was maintained for the 42-day period from January 23, 2023, to March 5, 2023. For the seven consecutive days before blood test number two, the average NMN intake was 1000 mg/day. However, there was no dramatic improvement or worsening of biological age data observed in the presence of NMN. Previous biological age values (both PhenoAge and aging.ai) have been as low as the recent '27 value without NMN supplementation.
*   **Levothyroxine:** Taken since a hypothyroidism diagnosis in the twenties.
*   **Vitamin D:** 1000 IU/day supplemented for about eight to nine months of the year (non-summer months).
*   No other purported geroprotectors or senolytics were used.
*   **Glycine:** Supplementation continued for a few days after blood test number one but was stopped after homocysteine data indicated no reduction, suggesting the experiment to reduce homocysteine with glycine was unsuccessful.

## Diet Composition

The following diet composition corresponds to the 42-day period from the day of the last test through the day before test number two in 2023. The diet has been purposely consistent across recent tests, as this diet, including macros and micronutrients, is consistently associated with relatively youthful biomarker data, including Horvath epigenetic age, homocysteine, and DHEA sulfate.

### Calorie and Food Intake

*   **Average Daily Calorie Intake:** 2177 calories per day. This is the lowest average daily calorie intake since diet tracking began in April 2015, with the previous low being 2194 calories/day for test number one in 2023.
*   **Top Foods (by calorie contribution):** Sardines were a top contributor. The top 10 foods by calorie contribution remained consistent with test number one, with some variation in order, due to the consistently youthful biomarker data.
*   **Cheat Days:** For this 42-day period, there was one "cheat day," which included a full chocolate bar with peanut butter and dates. The diet is generally purposefully clean, with a maximum of two cheat days to prevent cravings for junk food.

### Macronutrient Breakdown

Diet tracking was performed using Chronometer since 2015.

*   **Protein Intake:** Average 95.3 grams per day, equating to 17.5% of total calories.
*   **Fat Intake:** Average 82.3 grams per day, equating to 34% of total calories.
*   **Carbohydrate Intake:**
    *   Total carbohydrates: Approximately 302 grams per day.
    *   Average daily fiber intake: Approximately 86 grams per day.
    *   Net carbohydrates (total carbs minus fiber): 217 grams per day.
    *   Net carbohydrates contributed 39.9% of total calories (217g * 4 kcal/g / 2177 kcal/day).

**Fiber Conversion Process:**
Soluble Fiber -> Gut Bacteria -> Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA) -> Fat (caloric contribution)

*   Fiber contributes approximately 2.2 calories per gram. With 86 grams of fiber, this adds 189 calories, which is 8.7% of total calories. This caloric contribution from fiber, converted to short-chain fatty acids, is added to the total fat percentage.

**Revised Net Macronutrient Composition:**
*   Fat: ~43% (34% from direct fat + 8.7% from fiber conversion)
*   Net Carbs: ~40%
*   Protein: ~17.5%

*   **Total Fructose Intake:** 58.1 grams per day. This is close to the lowest fructose intake since tracking began in 2015 (previous low was 58.5 g/day). Fructose intake is monitored due to its correlation with negative biomarker trends, especially from sources like strawberries, carrots, and beets.

### Micronutrient Intake

*   **RDA Coverage:** Full Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) coverage was met for all vitamins and minerals.
*   **Higher than RDA:** Many micronutrient levels were purposely higher than the RDA to align with correlations to blood biomarkers.
    *   **Niacin:** Approximately 42 mg/day (about 2.5 times the RDA).
    *   **Folate:** Approximately 1000 micrograms/day (about 2.5 times the RDA).
    *   **Magnesium:** Approaching two-fold higher than the RDA of 400 mg/day.
    *   **Vitamin K:** 17 times the RDA, as it is significantly correlated with more biomarkers moving in a favorable direction.
