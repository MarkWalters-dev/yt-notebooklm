# 2023-11-01 HbA1c - What s Optimal What s My Data

## Executive Summary

*   HbA1c levels generally increase with age, rising from approximately 5-5.3% in young adults (around 20 years old) to a peak around 5.8-6% in individuals aged 70-80 years.
*   Some research suggests a decline in HbA1c in individuals living beyond 70-80 years, which may be attributed to survivor bias.
*   A meta-analysis of 46 studies indicates that both very low HbA1c (<5%) and elevated HbA1c (>6%) are associated with a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality.
*   The lowest risk for all-cause mortality is observed in the HbA1c range of 5-6%, with values closer to 5-5.3% considered optimal, as this range is typical for youth and avoids the increased risk associated with values below 5%.
*   The speaker's current HbA1c is 5.1%, which is lower than their age-expected value of 5.8%, aligning with their goal of optimizing health biomarkers.

## Age-Related HbA1c Changes

Two studies shed light on age-related changes in HbA1c.

1.  **Study 1 (6,000+ people):** Average HbA1c values were around 5% in youth (20 years old) and significantly higher, approximately 6%, in 90-year-olds.
2.  **Study 2 (378,000 people):** Average HbA1c values for both women and men were about 5.3% in youth (20 years). These levels increased during aging, peaking in the 70-80 year range. Interestingly, HbA1c then showed a decline in older age. This decline could potentially be a result of survivor bias, where individuals living to older ages (over 70-80) tend to have relatively lower HbA1c values.

From these studies, it is evident that HbA1c generally increases during the aging process.

## HbA1c and All-Cause Mortality Risk

A meta-analysis of 46 studies investigated the relationship between circulating HbA1c levels and the risk of all-cause mortality. The analysis revealed the following:

*   **HbA1c lower than 5%:** Associated with a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality. The pooled hazard ratio indicated a 90% increased risk, with a 95% confidence interval (1.04 to 1.36) entirely above one.
*   **HbA1c in the 5-6% range:** This range was used as the referent for comparison and is associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality.
*   **HbA1c in the 6-6.5% range:** Also showed a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality, specifically a 16% increased risk.
*   **HbA1c greater than 6.5%:** Presented the greatest risk, with a 71% increased all-cause mortality risk.

## Optimal HbA1c Range

Considering both the age-related increases in HbA1c and the all-cause mortality risk data, an optimal HbA1c range appears to be in the **5 to 5.3%** range. This range is consistent with values found in youth and falls within the broader 5-6% range associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk, while avoiding values below 5% which are linked to increased mortality.

## Personal HbA1c Data

On October 9, the speaker's HbA1c was **5.1%**. Based on chronological age and the data from the two studies on age-related changes, the expected HbA1c would be 5.8%. The current HbA1c of 5.1% is lower than the age-expected value, indicating successful optimization of this biomarker.
