# 2024-08-18 Diet Composition That Corresponds To A 17.6y Younger Biological Age Blood Test 5 In 2024

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age, measured by PhenoAge (Blood Test 5, 2024), was 17.6 years younger than chronological age.
*   Dietary manipulation included a significant **reduction in mushroom intake** (from 250g/day to 95g/day), potentially to lower Nicotinamide intake which may correlate with increased Homocysteine.
*   **Saturated fat intake was reduced** by approximately 8 grams/day (a 10g/day total fat cut) by reducing coconut butter and cacao beans, tested against correlations suggesting saturated fat raises Horvath epigenetic age.
*   Average daily calorie intake stabilized at **2,162 calories** after two preceding tests showed strength decrements when caloric restriction was too aggressive.
*   Net macronutrient breakdown for this period was approximately **43% Total Fat, 36% Net Carbs, and 21% Protein**, based on calculated fiber contribution to energy.

## Study Period and Methodology

The analysis covers the 59-day period immediately following Blood Test 4 through the day before Blood Test 5 (May 28 to July 25). Average daily intake was calculated based on all weighed food consumption over this period.

## Key Dietary Experiments and Changes

The goal was to optimize all biomarkers simultaneously, focusing on improving weak spots (e.g., Homocysteine, Horvath age, DHEA sulfate, telomere length) without disrupting already optimal markers.

### 1. Mushroom Intake Reduction
*   **Change:** Reduced average daily mushroom intake from 250g (Test 4) to 95g (Test 5).
*   **Rationale:** Mushrooms are rich in Ergothenine and Spermidine. The reduction was performed because mushrooms contain Niacin primarily as Nicotinamide. High Nicotinamide levels are hypothesized to increase plasma Homocysteine levels more than Nicotinic Acid.

### 2. Broccoli Sprouts and Sulforaphane Reintroduction
*   **Action:** Reintroduced home-grown broccoli sprouts.
*   **Rationale:** Broccoli sprouts and broccoli are rich sources of Sulforaphane, which reduces oxidative stress that can limit telomere length (a trending low biomarker).
*   **Protocol Note:** To maximize Sulforaphane content (which degrades with heat), sprouts were added to a cooked mix *after* cooking. Mustard powder was added to help minimize heat degradation.

### 3. Saturated Fat Reduction
*   **Action:** Reduced intake of coconut butter and cacao beans, the two primary dietary sources of saturated fat.
*   **Rationale:** Data correlations showed that total fat and relatively higher saturated fatty acid intake were significantly correlated with an older Horvath epigenetic age. This experiment tested if reducing saturated fat would improve the Horvath age.

### 4. Fermented Food Addition
*   **Action:** Added Kimchi (fermented cabbage).
*   **Rationale:** Fermented foods contain specific *Lactobacillus* species shown to positively impact the gut-muscle axis, potentially improving muscle mass and function. Intake levels are currently unknown but are kept relatively low.

### 5. Selenium/Brazil Nut Adjustment
*   **Action:** Increased Brazil nut intake to near the highest recorded level (14g/day vs. 7-8g/day previously) to increase Selenium intake (up to $\approx 400 \mu g/day$).
*   **Rationale:** Selenium is a required cofactor for converting T4 to T3 thyroid hormone. The goal was to improve the Free T3/Free T4 ratio, which declines with age.
*   **Result:** No change observed in Free T3 or Free T4 levels. Intake was subsequently reduced for the next test.

### 6. Sardine Intake Increase
*   **Action:** Increased sardine intake by approximately 45g/day over the previous test level.
*   **Rationale:** Sardines showed a net positive correlation score (+6) with a panel of 25 clinical chemistry biomarkers, suggesting a positive effect on aging biomarkers.
*   **Result:** PhenoAge did not change. Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and Uric Acid slightly increased (attributed to higher protein and purine content, respectively). Intake was subsequently cut back.

## Cleanliness of Diet

*   **Cheat Meals:** Two days out of the 59-day period included "junk food" consumption (baked cheesecake, raspberry jam, caramel sauce).
*   **Calorie Contribution:** These items contributed slightly more than 2,500 calories total, equating to **2% of total calories** for the 59-day period.
*   **Conclusion:** A 98% clean diet (compared to 99% in prior tests) did not appear to significantly impact PhenoAge or clinical chemistry biomarkers.

## Macronutrient Profile (Averages)

| Nutrient | Amount (g/day) | % of Total Calories | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Calories** | 2,162 kcal | N/A | Stable level after recent increases to mitigate strength loss. |
| Protein | 112 g | 21% | |
| Total Fat | 83 g | 35% | Decrease from 93g in Test 4. |
| Saturated Fat | $\approx 8$ g reduction | N/A | Primary target for reduction related to Horvath age. |
| Total Carbohydrates | 281 g | N/A | |
| Fiber | 88 g | N/A | Contributes $\approx 188$ calories (9% of diet) via Short-Chain Fatty Acid conversion. |
| Net Carbohydrates | N/A | 36% | Total Carbs minus Fiber (193g net). |

**Calculated Net Macros:** 43% Total Fat, 36% Net Carbs, 21% Protein.

### Fructose Intake
*   Total Fructose (Fructose + 1/2 Sucrose) was $56.5 \text{ grams/day}$.
*   This is near the lowest recorded level ($56.2 \text{ grams/day}$), as high fructose intake correlates negatively with numerous blood biomarkers.

## Micronutrient Highlights

### Niacin and NAD
*   **Niacin Intake (Test 5):** Raised to $71 \text{ mg/day}$ (up from $42 \text{ mg/day}$ in Test 4), primarily from Nicotinic Acid.
*   **NAD Level (Test 5):** Measured at $\approx 28 \mu \text{M}$ on the day of testing, well above the observed minimum of $20 \mu \text{M}$ where strength decrement began.
*   **Plan:** Increase Nicotinic Acid and total Niacin to $\approx 80 \text{ mg/day}$ for the next test to ensure NAD levels remain safely above the strength-impairing threshold.

### Mineral Changes
*   **Calcium:** Increased by $\approx 100 \text{ mg/day}$ due to increased collard green intake (a low-oxalate, high-calcium vegetable), intended to limit oxalate absorption.
*   **Copper and Zinc:** Decreased, corresponding to the reduction in mushroom and cacao bean intake.
*   **Selenium:** Increased via Brazil nuts and sardines to $\approx 400 \mu g/day$ (Tolerable Upper Limit) with no observed effect on thyroid hormones.

## Calorie Tracking Consistency
This Test 5 marked the second consecutive test where calorie intake was *not* sequentially lower. After 21 prior tests achieved through small, gradual cuts, intake was increased slightly for Test 4 and increased further for Test 5 (now $\approx 100$ calories higher than two tests prior) in response to observed strength decrements (pull-ups, overhead press). The current intake level of 2,162 calories is planned to be maintained as strength has partially recovered.
