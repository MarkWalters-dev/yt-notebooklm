# 2025-03-09 Conquer Aging Or Die Trying Podcast Episode 6 - @Unaging.Crissman.Loomis

## Executive Summary

*   **Midday Exercise & Sunlight:** Moderate to vigorous physical activity performed between 11:00 AM and 5:00 PM is associated with a 10% reduction in all-cause mortality, primarily cardiovascular. Extensive sunlight exposure (including tanning) is linked to a 38% reduction in all-cause mortality, predominantly through cardiovascular benefits, and surprisingly, a reduced risk of skin cancer mortality.
*   **Light Spectrum Benefits:** Different light wavelengths offer distinct health benefits:
    *   **UVB:** Responsible for Vitamin D synthesis.
    *   **UVA:** Upregulates nitric oxide (NO) production, leading to reduced blood pressure and improved cardiovascular health, with effects lasting up to five days. It also plays a crucial role in regulating circadian rhythm.
    *   **Red/Near-Infrared (NIR) Light:** Improves mitochondrial ATP production by "knocking off" inhibitory molecules (nitric oxide, copper) and reduces systemic inflammation.
*   **Astaxanthin Potential:** Clinical trials suggest oral and topical astaxanthin (e.g., 4-8 mg/day) can improve skin health by reducing wrinkles, age spots, and trans-epidermal water loss, and increasing elasticity and moisture. The Interventions Testing Program (ITP) in mice has shown astaxanthin to significantly increase median lifespan in male mice.
*   **Comprehensive Skincare Protocol:** A multi-component approach to facial anti-aging includes daily broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30+), regular moisturizing, topical and oral low-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid, oral collagen peptides, topical retinoids (tretinoin or retinol), red/NIR light therapy, and potentially derma stamping.

## Sunlight Benefits

### Time of Day for Physical Activity & Mortality
A study based on the Biobank cohort investigated the optimal time for moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). The findings indicate that engaging in MVPA between 11:00 AM and 5:00 PM is associated with a 10% reduction in all-cause mortality. This benefit primarily targets cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, showing particular significance for individuals aged 65 and older. Cancer mortality remains largely unaffected by the timing of exercise. The mechanism behind this midday benefit is not fully understood, but it is not explained by better morning responses or alignment with individual circadian rhythms, as both early birds and evening larks benefit most from midday activity.

### Sunlight Exposure and Mortality
Research, including the MIS (Melanoma in Southern Sweden) cohort study by Dr. Lindqvist, challenges the conventional advice to strictly avoid sunlight. This study tracked individuals who actively sought sunlight exposure, including tanning salons, beach vacations, and sunbathing in reflective mountain environments during winter. The findings show that individuals with the highest sunlight exposure have a 38% reduction in all-cause mortality compared to those with less exposure. This reduction is comparable in magnitude to the benefits of weightlifting. Similar to midday exercise, this benefit largely stems from reduced cardiovascular disease and non-cancer, non-CVD mortalities (e.g., respiratory illness), with no significant impact on cancer mortality.

### Skin Cancer Paradox
Studies in Australia and Sweden reveal a surprising inverse relationship between sun exposure and skin cancer mortality. While individuals with high occupational sun exposure exhibit a 60% increase in non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), those with the most overall sun exposure (even with visible sun damage) had approximately one-eighth the risk of dying from skin cancer compared to those with less exposure. This suggests that extensive sun exposure may offer a protective effect against the mortality associated with skin cancer, which is typically a lower-risk cancer.

### The Spectrum of Sunlight Benefits

Sunlight is a complex spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, with different wavelengths affecting the body in distinct ways.

#### Ultraviolet B (UVB) Light
*   **Wavelength:** Shortest, around 290-320 nanometers.
*   **Negative Effects:** Causes sunburn.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Avoid high summer sun during peak hours (midday).
    *   Use sunblock (all sunblocks protect against UVB).
*   **Positive Effects:** Triggers Vitamin D production.
*   **Practical Considerations:**
    *   UVB is effectively blocked by glass (soda-lime glass in most homes), so indoor exposure does not provide Vitamin D or cause sunburn.
    *   Clothing also blocks UVB.
    *   To obtain Vitamin D, expose skin to the sun when the UV index is moderate, avoiding sunburn.
    *   **Note:** Vitamin D supplementation alone does not fully replicate the benefits of full-spectrum sunlight, similar to how fiber supplements do not replicate the benefits of whole plant foods.

#### Ultraviolet A (UVA) Light
*   **Wavelength:** Longer than UVB, between UVB and visible light. Less energetic than UVB.
*   **Negative Effects:** Causes facial aging (photoaging) by reducing collagen.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Use broad-spectrum sunblock daily, as UVA is prevalent throughout the day and year, and penetrates most household glass.
*   **Positive Effects:**
    *   **Nitric Oxide (NO) Production:** UVA exposure strongly upregulates nitric oxide, a vasodilator that makes veins more flexible. This can reduce systolic blood pressure by approximately five points and significantly reduce cardiovascular disease risk. The effect, termed the "dark reaction," involves an immediate 14% increase in NO, with sustained elevated levels for up to five days post-exposure.
    *   **Circadian Rhythm Regulation:** UVA light is crucial for resetting the circadian rhythm, aiding in sleep regulation and overall sleep quality. Exposure to UVA in the eyes can help establish healthy sleep patterns.
*   **Practical Considerations:** UVA passes through most glass unless specially treated. It is also blocked by clothing.

#### Red and Near-Infrared (NIR) Light
*   **Wavelength:** Longest (visible red and invisible infrared), lowest energy. Red light generally penetrates the skin, while infrared penetrates deeper into the body.
*   **Blocking Factors:** Effectively blocked by clouds and water.
*   **Positive Effects:**
    *   **Mitochondrial Energy Production:** Red and NIR light can "knock off" nitric oxide and copper from molecules within mitochondria that are involved in electron transfer. This process greatly improves the efficiency of mitochondrial ATP (energy) production, potentially almost doubling cellular energy output.
        Mitochondria blocked by Copper/Nitric Oxide -> Red/Infrared Light Exposure -> Nitric Oxide/Copper released from molecules -> Improved mitochondrial efficiency -> Increased ATP production.
    *   **Inflammation Reduction:** Red and NIR light can significantly reduce inflammation throughout the body. For example, in studies where inflammation was induced using lipopolysaccharide, subsequent red light exposure reduced inflammation for up to three days. This effect is mediated by a transient increase in reactive oxygen species, followed by a profound anti-inflammatory response.
    *   **Skin and Hair Health:** By enhancing mitochondrial function, red and NIR light can improve skin and hair health.
*   **Practical Considerations:** While infrared light can penetrate clothes and glass (feeling heat on a sunny day), obtaining sufficient red/NIR light requires direct sun exposure on clear days or dedicated red light therapy devices.

### Sunlight Exposure Recommendations (Chris's Approach)
*   Daily sunscreen (SPF 30+) on the face and hands before breakfast, all day.
*   For Vitamin D and other benefits, aim for about two hours total of near-noon sunlight during the week on clear days (e.g., 30 minutes daily when UV index is 3-4).
*   Avoid UV index above 4-5 to prevent sunburn, even though it could produce Vitamin D faster. The goal is longer exposure for full-spectrum benefits.
*   In latitudes above 40 degrees, Vitamin D production from sun exposure is minimal in winter months.

### Considerations for Sunlight Research
*   **Association vs. Causation:** Epidemiological studies, like the Swedish study, show associations, not direct causation. Randomized controlled trials are needed for definitive proof.
*   **Healthy User Bias:** Individuals who exercise at midday or seek more sun exposure may generally be healthier. Controlling for all aspects of healthy user bias and comorbidities is crucial in interpreting epidemiological data.
*   **Optimal Dose:** Determining the optimal dose of sunlight exposure without sunscreen is challenging. While some suggest as little as 2-3 minutes of peak midday sun, others like Dr. Roger Seheult recommend 15-30 minutes.
*   **Environmental Factors:** Indoor artificial lighting with non-sunlight spectra may be detrimental. Historically, humans experienced light only when the sun was up and darkness when it was down. Modern lighting is often energy-efficient but lacks the full spectrum, especially red and NIR light, which are important for heat generation (and thus deemed inefficient).
*   **Beyond Visible Light:** The discussion extends beyond visible light to other electromagnetic frequencies, like ultrasound, which is being investigated for positive effects on health outcomes in Alzheimer's patients through brain stimulation.

## Binging & Calorie Restriction Reflections (Mike's Experience)

After maintaining strict calorie intake goals for four years, Mike experienced a significant calorie binge (approximately 5,700 calories) following a blood test on February 4th. This exceeded his maintenance calories (2,100-2,200) by about 3,500 calories.

### Lessons Learned and Adjustment Strategy:
1.  **Remove Temptation:** Immediately dispose of tempting "junk food" after a pre-planned "cheat meal." Keeping such foods in the house can lead to uncontrolled consumption.
2.  **Avoid Binge-Purge Cycle:** Historically, Mike's response to a binge was extreme fasting (a "purge"). This time, he avoided falling back into this unhealthy cycle by:
    *   Consuming 600 calories the day after the binge (approx. 1,500 below usual).
    *   Consuming 1,000 calories the second day after (approx. 1,100 below usual).
    *   Returning to a nearly normal diet (approx. 2,000 calories) on the third day after the binge.
    *   This strategy resulted in a net excess of about 900-1,000 calories over four days, which is minor in the context of a 50-day period.
3.  **Biomarker Impact:** A single binge is unlikely to significantly impact long-term biomarkers when followed by a prompt return to a healthy diet.

### Sleep, Metabolism, and Environment
Mike's experience highlights several interconnected factors influencing health and adherence to dietary regimens:
*   **Sleep Deprivation:** Published data indicates that sleep deprivation can lead to overeating the following day.
*   **Calorie Restriction & Sleep:** While moderate calorie restriction generally improves biomarkers, Mike experiences nighttime awakenings. This could be due to:
    *   **Lack of Morning Sunlight:** In Boston, morning sunlight is unavailable for 9 months of the year, hindering circadian rhythm regulation.
    *   **Hypothyroidism:** Low free T3 and T4 levels (similar to a 90-year-old) despite being on levothyroxine (T4). Poor conversion of T4 to active T3 may lead to suboptimal systemic metabolism and affect sleep.
    *   **Thermoregulation:** Inability to properly thermoregulate during sleep (due to hypothyroidism and environmental factors) may contribute to awakenings. Experimentation with bed temperature control (e.g., Eight Sleep) is planned.
    *   **Room Temperature & Humidity:** Manual thermostat control in an old apartment building limits optimal sleep temperature and humidity control, especially in summer.
    *   **Noise Pollution:** Proximity to a fire department and other urban noise sources frequently interrupts sleep, potentially contributing to wake-ups and fragmented sleep.
*   **Exercise & Sleep:** Mike's current routine of two 90-minute vigorous workouts per week *does not* improve sleep quality; instead, it tends to increase light sleep and decrease restorative sleep. This suggests that the current exercise dose or frequency may not be optimal for sleep. Spreading workouts (e.g., incorporating more HIIT) might improve sleep and allow for a slight increase in calorie intake.

## Astaxanthin & Lifespan

Astaxanthin is a carotenoid with potential benefits for skin health and longevity. Mike has historically lacked astaxanthin in his diet, as his primary fish source (sardines) does not contain it, unlike wild-caught salmon.

### Astaxanthin & Skin Health
Clinical trials (though few, and often vendor-funded, necessitating caution in interpretation) suggest astaxanthin may have positive effects on skin.
*   **Study 1 (Women):** Oral supplementation (6 mg/day) and topical application (2 mL) of astaxanthin improved skin wrinkles, age spot size, texture, and moisture content.
*   **Study 2 (Men):** Astaxanthin supplementation improved crow's feet wrinkles, elasticity, and reduced trans-epidermal water loss.
*   **Study 3 (UV-Induced Deterioration):** A physiological dose of 4 mg/day of astaxanthin for 10 weeks showed potential to reduce UV-induced skin swelling (erythema), though visual quantification of skin changes can be tricky.

### Astaxanthin & Lifespan in Mice
A gold-standard study from the Interventions Testing Program (ITP) investigated astaxanthin's effect on lifespan in mice.
*   **Findings:** In male mice, astaxanthin treatment significantly increased median survival compared to controls. An extension in maximal lifespan (e.g., 10% survival) also appeared evident, though the curves largely overlapped at this point. No similar effect was observed in female mice.

### Dietary Changes (Mike's Approach)
*   **Integrating Astaxanthin:** To incorporate astaxanthin, Mike has reduced sardine intake and now includes wild-caught salmon (a source of astaxanthin) in a 40-50% ratio with sardines. He consumes salmon approximately once every one to two weeks, portioning it for several days.

### Considerations for Collagen Absorption
*   **Whole Foods vs. Peptides:** Evolutionarily, humans consumed collagen from the connective tissues (ligaments, tendons, bone marrow) of whole animals. These tissues can be fermented by gut bacteria to produce short-chain fatty acids, which benefit systemic health.
*   **Peptide Absorption:** Collagen peptides are short chains of amino acids. Low-molecular-weight collagen peptides can be absorbed whole into the bloodstream via specific gut transporters, rather than being fully broken down into individual amino acids. The impact of this direct absorption versus fermentation of whole connective tissue on skin health and other outcomes is an open question, not yet addressed by research.

## The Anti-Aging Face Skincare Protocol

The skin, particularly on the face, is a significant indicator of aging. This protocol focuses on natural and reasonable interventions to protect and rejuvenate facial skin.

### Skincare Interventions
1.  **Stop UV Aging:**
    *   **Mechanism:** UVA radiation reduces collagen by 1-1.5% per year, leading to significant collagen loss (e.g., 30% by age 40). Photoaging can visibly age skin, as shown by studies comparing twins with different sun exposure levels.
    *   **Protocol:** Apply broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30+) to the face and hands daily, before breakfast, and throughout the day.
    *   **Evidence:** A 4.5-year Australian study showed daily sunscreen use reduced skin aging by 24%, effectively preventing further aging during the study period.
    *   **Product Example:** CeraVe AM (SPF 30) for daily use. (Non-affiliate product reference).
    *   **Verification Tool:** An ultraviolet light mirror can be used to visualize precise sunscreen application and coverage.

2.  **Moisturize:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Maintains skin hydration, leading to improved fullness and softness.
    *   **Protocol:** Use a simple moisturizer.
    *   **Benefit:** Provides quick, gratifying results in skin appearance.

3.  **Hyaluronic Acid (HA):**
    *   **Mechanism:** HA is highly hydrophilic, attracting 10-50 times its weight in water, thus helping to retain moisture in the face. Low-molecular-weight HA is preferred for better absorption.
    *   **Application:**
        *   **Topical:** Hyaluronic acid cream can achieve about a 40% reduction in wrinkles.
        *   **Oral:** Supplements (e.g., 120 micrograms/day of low-molecular-weight HA) can lead to a 26% reduction in wrinkles.
    *   **Product Examples:** CeraVe PM (includes HA) for topical use, Jarrow Formulas (low molecular weight) for oral supplementation. (Non-affiliate product references).

4.  **Rebuild Collagen:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Aims to restore collagen structure lost due to aging and UV damage. These interventions are typically slow to show effects, with visible changes accumulating over weeks and months.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   **Oral Collagen Peptides:** Supplementing with approximately 5 grams of low-molecular-weight collagen peptides daily. These peptides can be absorbed whole into the bloodstream without complete breakdown into individual amino acids. This can result in about a 20% reduction in wrinkle depth. Marine collagen (peptides) is preferred over beef collagen (due to concerns about Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy or "mad cow disease").
        *   **Retinoids (Tretinoin/Retinol):** Tretinoin (prescription Retin-A) or retinol (over-the-counter, lower strength) help rebuild facial structure and can achieve about a 35% reduction in wrinkle depth. Tretinoin acts more swiftly due to higher dosage.
        *   **Red/Near-Infrared (NIR) Light Therapy:** Application of red and infrared light (e.g., 10 minutes every three days) can reduce wrinkle depth by approximately 40%. The benefit continues to increase for weeks after initial collagen buildup, indicating a delay in visible structural change.
        *   **Derma Stamping (Microneedling):** Involves using a device with small titanium needles (0.1-1.5 mm depth) to create micro-punctures in the skin, stimulating collagen rebuilding during the healing process. This is typically done once a week and can be aided by topical anesthetics to reduce pain.

### Skincare Research Considerations
*   **pH of Products:** The pH of skincare products is important for the skin microbiome (optimal skin pH is around 5). Whether CeraVe products address this specifically is unknown.
*   **Quantifying Effects:** Objectively quantifying skin aging benefits from creams and interventions is challenging due to the difficulty of visual inspection and microscopic analysis. Ideally, controlled experiments (e.g., applying interventions to only one side of the face) would provide stronger evidence. Future imaging technologies might allow for direct microscopic visualization of collagen in the skin.
*   **Red Light Therapy Timing:** Some research, such as from Dr. Glenn Jeffrey's lab, suggests red light therapy for mitochondrial and nitric oxide benefits may only be effective in the morning, acting to "activate" mitochondria for the day. However, individual variability may exist, and the overall anti-inflammatory effects might be less time-dependent.
*   **Red Light & Eye Health:** While red light therapy can improve eye health, caution is advised with powerful red/NIR light devices due to intensity, necessitating the use of protective goggles.
