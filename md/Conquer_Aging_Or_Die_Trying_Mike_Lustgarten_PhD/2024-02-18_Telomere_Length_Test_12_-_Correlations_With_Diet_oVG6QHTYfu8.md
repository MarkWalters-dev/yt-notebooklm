# 2024-02-18 Telomere Length Test 12 - Correlations With Diet

## Executive Summary

*   Telomere length, a biomarker for aging, declines with age, with average lengths decreasing from 7.75 kilobases in youth to approximately 5 kilobases in 100-year-olds.
*   Over 12 telomere length tests, average telomere length has shown a slight year-over-year improvement and resistance to age-related decline.
*   Dietary intake of vitamin B1, black pepper, beets, selenium, and Brazil nuts are positively correlated with longer telomere length, even after adjusting for calorie intake.
*   Total fructose intake and higher calorie intake are significantly inversely correlated with telomere length.
*   An intervention phase is underway to test the hypothesis that increasing intake of foods and nutrients positively correlated with telomere length will further lengthen telomeres.

## Telomere Length Decline With Age

Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) plotted against age (20-100 years) shows a consistent age-related decline for both men and women.
*   Average telomere length in youth: 7.75 kilobases
*   Average telomere length in 100-year-olds: Approximately 5 kilobases

## Personal Telomere Length Trends

Telomere length data from 12 tests (True Diagnostic) shows a general improvement and resistance to age-related decline.
*   **2022 (3 tests):** Average telomere length: 7.04 kilobases
*   **2023 (8 tests):** Average telomere length: 7.13 kilobases
*   **January 15, 2024 (1 test):** Telomere length: 7.16 kilobases
    *   Note: This was a rebound from the previous test (7.06 kilobases), which occurred during a period of supplementing with 2 grams of NMN daily for a different experiment. The higher telomere length in this test was without NMN supplementation.

## Correlation Analysis: Diet and Telomere Length

Correlation analysis was performed by comparing 97 foods, macro, and micronutrients against telomere length using a dataset of 12 tests. The dietary data represents the average intake over a 60-day period preceding each blood test.

### Unadjusted Correlations (P < 0.05)

Out of 37 significantly correlated foods/nutrients:

**Positive Correlations (Higher intake associated with longer telomeres):**
*   Vitamin B1
*   Black pepper
*   Beets
*   Selenium
*   Brazil nuts
*   Cloves
*   Vitamin K

**Negative Correlation (Higher intake associated with shorter telomeres):**
*   Total fructose (excluding sugar-sweetened beverages and junk food due to a clean diet)

### Comparison of Correlations (Test #7 vs. Test #12)

*   **Number of significant correlations:** Decreased from 43 (after Test #7) to 37 (after Test #12).
*   **Consistently significant correlations:** Selenium, Vitamin B1, Brazil nuts, and Black pepper remained significant on both lists.
*   **Weakening Correlations:**
    *   Parmesan cheese: Correlation coefficient decreased from a top hit to -0.62 (still significant, P < 0.05).
    *   Cacao beans: Correlation coefficient decreased from -0.88 to -0.61 (still significant, P < 0.05).
    *   This suggests that other factors may have become more influential.

## Calorie Intake and Telomere Length

A significant inverse correlation exists between average daily calorie intake and telomere length.
*   Higher calorie intake is correlated with shorter telomere length.
*   Lower calorie intake is correlated with longer telomere length.
*   Correlation after Test #7: -0.85
*   Current correlation: Weaker than -0.85, suggesting factors beyond calorie intake may influence telomere length improvements.

## Adjusted Correlations (Multivariate Linear Regression)

Multivariate linear regression models were used to assess correlations after adjusting for calorie intake.

**Significantly Positively Correlated After Adjusting for Calorie Intake:**
*   Vitamin B1
*   Black pepper
*   Beets
*   Selenium
*   Brazil nuts

**No Longer Significant After Adjusting for Calorie Intake:**
*   Cloves (and others with weaker initial correlations)

## Intervention Phase ("F Around")

Based on the "Find Out" phase (measurement and correlation analysis), an "F Around" phase (intervention) has begun to test the hypothesis that increasing intake of positively correlated foods/nutrients will lengthen telomeres.

**Intervention Strategy:**
*   **Vitamin B1:** Introduced peas into the diet to increase Trigonelline, which may impact NAD.
*   **Black pepper, Beets, Selenium, Brazil nuts:** Increased or maintained relatively high intake.

**Next Test:**
*   Test #2 for 2024 is scheduled for March 4th. Data is expected in early April.
