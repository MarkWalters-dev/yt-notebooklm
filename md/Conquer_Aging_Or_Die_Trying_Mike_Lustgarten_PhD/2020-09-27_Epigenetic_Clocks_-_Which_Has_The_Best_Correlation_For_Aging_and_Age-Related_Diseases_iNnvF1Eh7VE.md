# 2020-09-27 Epigenetic Clocks - Which Has The Best Correlation For Aging and Age-Related Diseases

### Executive Summary:

*   Epigenetic clocks vary significantly in their ability to correlate with chronological age and predict various aging-related phenotypes, including cancer, cell senescence, and mitochondrial dysfunction.
*   The initial Horvath (2013) epigenetic clock demonstrated the strongest correlation with chronological age (0.94) among the 11 clocks reviewed.
*   Individual clocks showed specialized predictive strengths: Levine and Yang clocks excelled at identifying cancer, while Levine and Lynn clocks were better for most cell senescence markers.
*   A newly developed meta-epigenetic clock, derived from a composite of 11 existing clocks, showed enhanced predictive power for all-cause mortality risk, all three measures of cell senescence, and a novel association with Alzheimer's disease neuropathology.

The optimal epigenetic clock for correlating with chronological age or other aging-related phenotypes, including cancer, cell senescence, and mitochondrial dysfunction, is a critical question. A recent paper from Morgan Levine's group addresses this issue by comparing 11 published epigenetic clocks.

## Overview of Epigenetic Clocks (2011-2018)

Since 2011, 11 epigenetic clocks have been published:

*   **2011 - Bachland's Group:** Used methylation data from 2 sites, predicting 70% of chronological age variation.
*   **2012 - Garagnani Group:** Used 1 methylation site, identified a strong correlation of 0.92 with chronological age.
*   **2013 - Hanum's Group:** Used 71 methylation sites, identified a strong correlation of 0.96 with chronological age.
*   **2013 - Horvath Clock:** Used methylation data from 51 tissues and cells across 353 methylation sites, identifying correlations of 0.97 and 0.96 with chronological age in different datasets.
*   **2014 - Widener's Group:** Used 99-102 methylation sites, identified correlations ranging from 0.93 to 0.99 with chronological age.
*   **2016 - Lin's Group:** Used 99 methylation sites, showed a 0.93 correlation with chronological age.
*   **2016 - Vidal Bravo Group:** Used 8 methylation sites, found correlations of 0.97 and 0.67 with chronological age in training and validation cohorts, respectively.
*   **2016 - Yang's Group:** Used 385 methylation sites, but identified very weak correlations with chronological age in CD4 and monocytes (immune cells).
*   **2017 - Jang's Group:** Used 10 methylation sites, associated epigenetic age with all-cause mortality risk (ACM risk) rather than chronological age.
*   **2018 - Levine's Group:** Used 513 methylation sites, identified correlations of 0.68 and 0.74 with chronological age.
*   **2018 - Steve Horvath's Group (Update):** Updated their 2013 clock using 391 methylation sites, again identifying strong correlations with chronological age (0.90 and 0.95).

## Clock Performance Across Aging Phenotypes

### Correlation with Chronological Age

The study compared the correlation of each of the 11 clocks with chronological age using pooled data from 16 cell and tissue types (including breast, cheek, brain, colon, cord blood, skin, and monocytes).

The best-performing epigenetic clock for its association with chronological age was the initial Horvath epigenetic clock (2013), which showed a very strong correlation of 0.94. The more recent Horvath epigenetic clock (2018) also had a strong correlation of 0.85. In contrast, many other epigenetic clocks exhibited very weak or poor correlations with chronological age, such as Yang's clocks (0.23 or -0.49). Based on this data, both Horvath epigenetic clocks were the strongest predictors of chronological age.

### Prediction of Cancer

The researchers investigated the ability of six epigenetic clocks to predict cancer by comparing epigenetic age in tumor samples (from breast, colon, lung, and pancreas) against normal tissues.

The Levine and Yang epigenetic clocks were most effective at predicting cancer, showing a higher epigenetic age in tumor samples across various tissues compared to normal tissues. In contrast, while the Horvath epigenetic clocks were strong for chronological age, they were not significantly associated with a higher epigenetic age in tumor cells (breast, colon, lung, or pancreas) compared to normal tissues. This indicates that not all epigenetic age clocks have the same predictive ability for aging or cancer.

### Identification of Cell Senescence

The ability of six epigenetic clocks to identify cell senescence was analyzed by comparing epigenetic age acceleration across different stages of cellular senescence:

*   **EP:** Early passage cells (less senescent)
*   **NS:** Nearly senescent cells
*   **OIS:** Oncogene-induced senescent cells
*   **RS:** Replicatively senescent cells

The Levine and Lynn epigenetic clocks showed an increase in epigenetic age when progressing from less senescent (EP) cells to nearly senescent (NS) and replicatively senescent (RS) cells. However, they did not show a significant increase from early passage cells (EP) to oncogene-induced senescent (OIS) cells. The Hanum epigenetic clock was unique in showing an increase in epigenetic age for the OIS cells compared with non-senescent cells. This further highlights that epigenetic clocks vary in their ability to detect different aspects of cell senescence, cancer, or chronological age.

### Mitochondrial Dysfunction

To assess the clocks' ability to identify mitochondrial dysfunction, cells with normal mitochondrial function (143b rho-positive cells) were compared to cells with depleted mitochondrial DNA (rho-zero minus cells). Cells with depleted mitochondrial DNA exhibit dysfunctional mitochondria, leading to impaired ATP production and increased reactive oxygen species.

It was expected that cells with dysfunctional mitochondria would show higher epigenetic age acceleration. The Levine, Horvath (2018), Lin, and Yang epigenetic clocks all demonstrated significant increases in epigenetic age acceleration in mitochondrial DNA-depleted cells compared to cells with normal mitochondria. In contrast, the initial Horvath (2013) clock and the Hanum clock did not show significant increases in epigenetic age in these cells.

## The Meta Epigenetic Clock

A new meta-epigenetic clock was derived by combining data from all 11 individual clocks. This composite clock was then evaluated for its association with various aging-related phenotypes.

### All-Cause Mortality Risk (ACM)

The meta-epigenetic clock showed a stronger association with all-cause mortality risk compared to the previously best-performing individual clocks (Levine and Jang). An older epigenetic age as measured by the meta-epigenetic clock was associated with a more than six-fold increased risk of all-cause mortality, which was double the risk identified by the Levine and Jang clocks (around three-fold).

### Correlation with Chronological Age

The meta-epigenetic clock's association with chronological age was examined across four tissue types: whole blood, breast, brain, and skin cells. While the Horvath clocks showed very strong correlations (0.85 or higher) with chronological age, the meta-epigenetic clock did not perform as well as the initial Horvath clock in this regard. This reinforces the idea that an epigenetic clock optimized for one phenotype may not be optimal for another.

### Prediction of Cancer

The meta-epigenetic clock showed a significant increase in epigenetic age in tumor cells compared to normal cells for breast, colon, lung, and pancreas tissues. This indicates its utility in identifying cancer.

### Identification of Cell Senescence

One of the most notable findings for the meta-epigenetic clock was its association with cell senescence. Unlike individual clocks, which often showed significant increases for only one or two measures of senescence, the meta-epigenetic clock demonstrated significantly higher epigenetic age for all three measures of senescence (nearly senescent, oncogene-induced senescent, and replicatively senescent cells) when compared with early passage (less senescent) cells.

### Association with Alzheimer's Disease Neuropathology

The meta-epigenetic clock was found to be associated with Alzheimer's disease neuropathology. Positive standardized betas indicated that a higher epigenetic age, as measured by the meta-epigenetic clock, was correlated with:

*   More amyloid
*   More neuritic plaques
*   More neurofibrillary tangles (NFT)
*   A higher tangle load

This represents a new and novel association identified by the meta-epigenetic clock.
