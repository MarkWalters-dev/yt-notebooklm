# 2024-08-21 High Mushroom Intake High Homocysteine

### Executive Summary
*   Plasma homocysteine levels increase with age, correlating with a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality, even at low concentrations.
*   Traditional homocysteine-lowering strategies (TMG/betaine, folate, serine/B6, other methyl donors) proved ineffective or had negative side effects for the speaker.
*   Human studies indicate that nicotinamide significantly increases homocysteine levels, while nicotinic acid causes only a minor increase.
*   The speaker's personal data revealed a strong positive correlation (r = 0.72) between high mushroom intake (a source of nicotinamide) and elevated homocysteine levels.
*   A reduction in mushroom intake led to a decrease in homocysteine, suggesting a potential link between dietary mushrooms/nicotinamide and homocysteine regulation, though protein intake was a confounder requiring further investigation.

## Homocysteine, Aging, and Mortality Risk

Plasma homocysteine levels increase with age. For individuals aged 12-80+, average homocysteine values are around 6-7 micromolar in youth and increase to 11-12 micromolar in those over 80 years old.

Higher homocysteine levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality (ACM) risk. A meta-analysis of six studies (n=28,000) demonstrated that ACM risk significantly increases even at very low homocysteine levels (1-2 micromolar), with risk rising as homocysteine concentrations increase. These data suggest that lower homocysteine levels are associated with better outcomes, and preventing the age-related increase may be important for minimizing all-cause mortality risk.

## Speaker's Personal Homocysteine Data

The speaker tracked homocysteine since 2005, with 41 blood tests over 20 years. In their early to mid-thirties, average homocysteine was 7.1 micromolar. After a 10-year hiatus, testing resumed, and over the past six years (35 tests), average homocysteine has been 10.3 micromolar, which is considered age-expected. A two-sample t-test confirmed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) between the two periods, indicating an age-related increase in homocysteine levels for the speaker.

## Homocysteine Reduction Strategies and Speaker's Experience

### TMG (Trimethylglycine) / Betaine
Homocysteine metabolism can be influenced by betaine. Betaine (or TMG, trimethylglycine) acts as a methyl donor:
**Homocysteine + Betaine -> Methionine + Dimethylglycine**
This process theoretically reduces circulating homocysteine levels. However, the speaker's personal experiment with 4 grams/day of trimethylglycine did not significantly impact homocysteine levels.

### Folate and Vitamin B12
Another pathway for homocysteine reduction involves folate and vitamin B12:
**Homocysteine + Folate + Vitamin B12 -> Methionine**

In the speaker's data (35 tests), folate intake was not significantly correlated with homocysteine levels (p=0.113), though the correlation trended in the expected direction.
Vitamin B12 intake, however, was significantly and negatively correlated with homocysteine levels (r = -0.54, p = 0.0009). Higher B12 intake correlated with lower homocysteine. The speaker attempted high-dose methyl B12 (up to 1000 micrograms/day). Despite the positive correlation with lower homocysteine, high-dose vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms/day) was also significantly correlated with four other biomarkers moving in an undesirable direction (associated with aging or ACM risk). Lower doses (300-500 micrograms/day) had no impact on homocysteine. Therefore, high-dose B12 was deemed unsuitable due to potential negative impacts on other biomarkers.

### Serine and Vitamin B6
Another pathway converts homocysteine into cystine, which is a precursor for glutathione (GSH):
**Homocysteine + Serine + Vitamin B6 -> Cystathionine**
**Cystathionine + Vitamin B6 -> Cystine**
Cystine can then be incorporated into glutathione. Both cystine and glutathione decline with aging.

The speaker experimented with high-dose serine (up to 6 grams/day), but it did not significantly impact homocysteine levels. Vitamin B6 intake was also not significantly correlated with homocysteine in the speaker's data (p > 0.05).

### Other Methyl Donors
The speaker also experimented with increasing intake of other potential methyl donors, including proline betaine, tryptophan betaine, and trigonelline (1-methyl nicotinic acid), but none had an impact on homocysteine.

## Mushroom Intake and Nicotinamide

Given the lack of success with previous interventions, the speaker considered dietary factors, specifically mushroom intake, as a potential cause of elevated homocysteine. Mushrooms are a rich source of ergothioneine and spermine, metabolites known to increase lifespan in mice. The speaker maintained a high mushroom intake (average 250 grams), but noted that mushrooms also contain nicotinamide (inferred because nicotinic acid would likely elevate NAD levels beyond age-expected, which was not observed).

A human randomized controlled trial showed that nicotinamide significantly increases homocysteine.
*   **Nicotinamide (300 mg):** Plasma homocysteine increased from 11 micromolar to 16 micromolar at 1.5 hours, and to 18 micromolar at 3 hours.
*   **Water (Control):** No change in plasma homocysteine.
*   **Nicotinic Acid (300 mg):** A minor increase in homocysteine from 11 to 12 micromolar, significantly less than with nicotinamide.

The speaker noted that a much lower dose of nicotinic acid (50 mg/day) achieved the same NAD-raising effect as 300 mg of nicotinamide, suggesting that such a low dose of nicotinamide might not cause the same homocysteine increase.

## Speaker's Data: Mushroom Intake & Homocysteine Correlation

The speaker analyzed 27 tests correlating daily mushroom intake with homocysteine levels. A significant, strong positive correlation was found (r = 0.72), indicating that higher mushroom intake was associated with higher homocysteine levels.

To test this correlation, the speaker reduced mushroom intake from an average of 250 grams/day to 95 grams/day for a subsequent test. The homocysteine level of 8.9 micromolar observed after this reduction was comparable to lower values previously achieved only with high-dose vitamin B12 (over 500 micrograms/day) and zero mushroom intake. The reduction in homocysteine after cutting mushrooms suggests a potential pathway for reduction, akin to effects seen with methyl donors, even though no methyl donor supplements were taken.

A confounding factor was protein intake, which was significantly correlated with lower homocysteine in the speaker's data (higher protein intake, lower homocysteine). For the test with reduced mushroom intake, protein intake had also increased by approximately 15 grams/day, making it unclear whether the homocysteine reduction was due to lower mushroom intake (and thus lower nicotinamide) or higher protein intake, or a combination of both.

**Future Protocol to Isolate Mushroom Effect:**
*   Maintain mushroom intake at 95 grams/day.
*   Reduce protein intake from 112 grams/day back to 95-100 grams/day (levels prior to the confounded test).
*   **Expected Outcome:** If homocysteine remains at 9 micromolar or less, it would suggest that high mushroom intake (and associated nicotinamide) was a primary factor contributing to elevated homocysteine.
