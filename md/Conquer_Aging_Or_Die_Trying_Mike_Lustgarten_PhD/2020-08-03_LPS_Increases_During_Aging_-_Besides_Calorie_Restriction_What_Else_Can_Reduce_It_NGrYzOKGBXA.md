# 2020-08-03 LPS Increases During Aging - Besides Calorie Restriction What Else Can Reduce It

## Executive Summary

*   Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels increase with aging in both mice and humans, which is linked to a significant increase (up to sevenfold) in CD38 expression in macrophages.
*   Intestinal levels of *E. coli* (a major source of LPS) and the incidence of *E. coli* bacteremia both increase dramatically with advanced age.
*   Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (IAP) detoxifies LPS by removing phosphate groups from its lipid A core, preventing its binding to the TLR receptor and subsequent pro-inflammatory signaling.
*   IAP activity declines with age in humans, and both knockout and supplementation studies in mice show that IAP levels directly influence frailty and lifespan (knockout increases frailty/reduces lifespan; supplementation decreases frailty/increases lifespan).
*   Interventions that increase IAP—such as Omega-3 fatty acids, high soluble fiber diets (via butyrate), and Vitamin K1/K2 supplementation (depending on intestinal segment)—may reduce circulating LPS and systemically benefit NAD levels by lowering CD38 activity.

## LPS, Aging, and NAD Metabolism Link

LPS (Lipopolysaccharide or endotoxin) is known to increase CD38 expression. Calorie restriction (CR) reduces LPS, hypothesizing that CR's benefit on NAD levels may be partly due to this LPS reduction. The key question addressed is what other interventions can reduce LPS to maximize NAD production.

**LPS and Aging:**
*   LPS levels increase during aging in mice and humans.
*   This age-related LPS increase correlates with up to a sevenfold increase in CD38 gene expression in macrophages in the presence of LPS.
*   Macrophages exposed to LPS release CD38 extracellularly, suggesting an increase in circulating CD38 that negatively impacts systemic NAD levels.

**LPS Source and Age-Related Distribution:**
LPS is found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.

1.  **Bacteremia Incidence:** The incidence of *E. coli* bacteremia (bacteria in the blood) is significantly elevated in older populations compared to middle-aged adults (approximately 10 times higher incidence in those $\ge 74$ years old compared to the 25–49 age group).
2.  **Intestinal Abundance:** Intestinal levels of *E. coli* increase with age. Individuals over 80 have *E. coli* levels reaching 12–14% of total intestinal bacteria, compared to around 7–8% in the 40–49 age group.
3.  **Mechanism of Entry:** Increased intestinal *E. coli* combined with decreased gut barrier function explains the rise of LPS-containing *E. coli* in the blood during aging.

## Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (IAP) as an LPS Detoxifier

Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (IAP) is a protein found in the intestine that detoxifies LPS.

**IAP Mechanism of Action:**
IAP is a phosphatase that acts on the Lipid A portion of LPS:
$$ \text{Intact LPS (with phosphates)} \xrightarrow{\text{IAP (Dephosphorylation)}} \text{Detoxified LPS (without phosphates)} $$

*   **Intact LPS:** Binds to its receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), on intestinal epithelial cells (and other cells), initiating a pro-inflammatory cascade.
*   **Detoxified LPS:** Cannot bind to TLR, thus preventing the pro-inflammatory signaling cascade (e.g., reducing TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1 beta expression).

**IAP Levels and Aging:**
*   Human data shows that IAP levels in intestinal contents decrease by approximately 50% between a person in their thirties (value $\approx 0.4$) and a person in their seventies (value $\approx 0.2$).

**IAP Functional Consequences in Mice:**
*   **Frailty:** In mice, knocking out IAP (simulating low levels) resulted in significantly increased frailty in older animals (12 and 21 months old) compared to wild-type controls. Supplementing IAP resulted in reduced frailty at 18 and 21 months.
*   **Lifespan:** Mice lacking IAP showed a significantly shorter survival curve (reduced average and maximum lifespan). Conversely, mice supplemented with IAP demonstrated increased average and maximum lifespan.

## Dietary Interventions to Increase IAP

Increasing IAP is hypothesized to reduce circulating LPS, leading to lower CD38 expression and maximized NAD levels.

### 1. Omega-3 Fatty Acids (Fish Oil)
Studies using transgenic animals with increased tissue Omega-3 or direct fish oil supplementation demonstrated:
*   Reduced Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio.
*   Increased IAP levels in the gut microbiome.
*   Decreased *E. coli* levels and intestinal LPS.
*   Decreased gut permeability and decreased levels of LPS in the blood.
*   The effect of reduced circulating LPS cascade included less binding to TLR4, resulting in lower pro-inflammatory markers (TNF-$\alpha$, IL-6, IL-1$\beta$).

### 2. High Soluble Fiber Diet
Soluble fiber is fermented by gut bacteria into Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs): Acetate (C2), Propionate (C3), and Butyrate (C4).
*   Exposure of colonic epithelial cells to SCFAs showed that Butyrate (C4) induced the highest levels of IAP gene expression compared to other tested SCFAs (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6).
*   **Hypothesis:** Eating a high soluble fiber diet increases butyrate, which in turn increases intestinal IAP levels.

### 3. Ketogenic Diet (Hypothetical)
A high-fat ketogenic diet increases fatty acid oxidation, leading to increased Acetate (C2), which can be converted into Butyrate. Direct RCT evidence for a ketogenic diet increasing IAP is currently lacking.

### 4. Vitamin K
Vitamin K supplementation has been shown to increase intestinal IAP activity in rats:
*   **Duodenum:** Vitamin K1 increased IAP activity, but K2 did not.
*   **Jejunum:** Both Vitamin K1 and Vitamin K2 increased IAP activity compared to controls.
*   **Dose Conversion:** The study used a high dose in rats (600 mg/kg of food). Estimated equivalent human daily dose for similar IAP boost is approximately 1,500 micrograms ($\mu$g) of Vitamin K1. This is significantly higher than the standard Adequate Intake (AI) of $\sim 100 \mu$g/day.

**Conclusion:** Increasing IAP via dietary modulation (Omega-3s, high soluble fiber, Vitamin K) is a low-risk strategy to potentially reduce LPS, decrease CD38 expression, and improve NAD levels, although the direct link between IAP and NAD has not yet been experimentally tested.
