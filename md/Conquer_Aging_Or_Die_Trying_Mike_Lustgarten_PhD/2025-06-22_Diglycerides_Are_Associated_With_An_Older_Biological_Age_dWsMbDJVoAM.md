# 2025-06-22 Diglycerides Are Associated With An Older Biological Age

## Executive Summary

*   Diglycerides (DAGs) are lipids containing two fatty acids esterified to a glycerol backbone and are found in many processed foods.
*   Higher levels of various diglyceride species are associated with an older epigenetic age, as measured by the GrimAge clock.
*   Elevated plasma levels of diglycerides are significantly correlated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality.
*   Personal data suggests that higher Niacin (Vitamin B3) intake and higher intracellular NAD+ levels may be associated with increased DAG sums, indicating a potential non-linear relationship with optimal health markers.

## Introduction to Diglycerides

Diglycerides (DAGs) are molecules composed of glycerol with two fatty acids attached. They are present in various food products, including ice cream sandwiches, flour tortillas, peanut butter, and coffee creamers.

## Diglycerides and Epigenetic Age

*   **Association with GrimAge:** Diglyceride metabolites, regardless of the saturation or unsaturation of their fatty acid chains (saturated, mono-unsaturated, or poly-unsaturated), are generally associated with an older epigenetic age as determined by the GrimAge DNA methylation clock.
*   **Age Acceleration:** This association indicates age acceleration, meaning that individuals with higher DAG levels tend to have an epigenetic age that is older than their chronological age. While some DAG species may not show a significant association, the majority demonstrate this trend.

## Diglycerides and All-Cause Mortality Risk

A study followed individuals for up to 23 years, assessing the correlation between baseline plasma diglyceride levels and all-cause mortality.

*   **Increased Hazard Ratio:** All six diglyceride species examined in the study were associated with an increased hazard ratio for mortality.
*   **Magnitude of Risk:** This increased risk ranged from 5% to 8% higher for individuals with relatively higher levels of these diglycerides. For example, DAG c32:0 showed a 1.08 hazard ratio (8% higher risk) with a 95% confidence interval of 1.05 to 1.12.
*   **Statistical Significance:** The associations were statistically significant, with p-values and false discovery rates (FDR) below 0.05.

## Personal Metabolomic Data

*   **Tracking DAGs:** Personal data collected using at-home metabolomics kits has tracked various diglyceride species and their sum since 2023.
*   **DAG Sum Trend:** The average DAG sum for the first 13 tests was 9.7 micromolar. However, the average DAG sum for the subsequent four tests increased to 12.4 micromolar, indicating a trend in the "wrong direction."
*   **Definition of DAG Species:**
    *   **DAG 16:0_16:0 (c32:0):** Composed of two saturated palmitic acid chains.
    *   **DAG 32:1:** Can be formed from various combinations of fatty acids, such as palmitate (16:0) and palmitoleate (16:1), or myristate (14:0) and oleate (18:1).

## Diglycerides, Diet, and NAD+

*   **Dietary Correlations:** Analysis of dietary intake correlated with DAG sum revealed a significant positive correlation (r = 0.67, p = 0.003) with Niacin (Vitamin B3) intake. Higher Niacin intake was associated with a higher DAG sum.
    *   Current Niacin intake from diet is approximately 50 mg/day, exceeding the RDA. Higher intake is achieved through supplementation with Nicotinic Acid.
*   **NAD+ Correlation:** Intracellular NAD+ levels were also examined for correlation with the DAG sum.
    *   A positive correlation (r = 0.43) was observed, though the p-value was slightly outside the typical significance threshold (p = 0.08).
    *   These data suggest that NAD+ levels above approximately 30 micromolar may be associated with higher DAG plasma levels. This is contrary to some online discussions suggesting higher NAD+ levels are optimal.
*   **Potential for Optimization:** The observed correlations suggest that for personal optimization, maintaining NAD+ levels below a certain threshold (e.g., 30 micromolar) might be beneficial for minimizing DAGs, which are linked to increased all-cause mortality risk and older epigenetic age.
*   **Further Investigation:** The role of different Niacin forms (Nicotinic Acid vs. Nicotinamide-based supplements like NMN or NR) requires further investigation. It is also noted that DAG sum values can be elevated even at lower NAD+ levels, indicating the complexity of these relationships.

## Conclusion

Diglycerides are metabolically relevant lipids associated with detrimental health outcomes, including accelerated epigenetic aging and increased all-cause mortality risk. Further research and personal tracking are ongoing to understand the complex interplay between diet, NAD+ levels, and diglyceride metabolism for optimizing healthspan.
