# 2020-06-26 Blood test analysis 100 year old subject

## Executive Summary
*   The centenarian subject does not possess known longevity-associated alleles for the FOXO3A and APOE genes, nor does she have exceptionally long telomeres.
*   Her liver function biomarkers are generally good, with particularly high albumin levels, indicative of biological youth.
*   Her lipid profile is considered good for her age, with higher HDL and LDL levels associated with reduced mortality risk in older adults.
*   Significant areas of concern include reduced kidney function (eGFR of 35), prediabetic glucose levels, and hematological markers (high MCV and RDW) associated with increased mortality risk.
*   Low inflammation (CRP) and high lymphocyte counts suggest a strong immune response, potentially counteracting some of the negative findings.

## Subject Demographics
*   **Height:** 147 cm (4 ft 9 in)
*   **Weight:** 45 kg (99 lbs)
*   **BMI:** 20.8 m²/kg
    *   Note: BMIs in this range (<25) are often reported in centenarian studies.

## Genetic Associations with Longevity
*   **FOXO3A:**
    *   Subject's genotype: 1 G allele, 1 T allele (not associated with longevity).
    *   Longevity association: GG genotype (two copies of the G allele).
*   **APOE:**
    *   Subject's genotype: E3/E3 (derived from T allele and C allele for the analyzed SNPs).
    *   Longevity association: E2/E3 genotype.
    *   Increased mortality risk association: E4/E3 genotype.
*   **Telomere Length:**
    *   Subject's relative telomere length: 0.66
    *   Average for female centenarians: 0.84
    *   Note: The subject's telomere length is below the average for her age group, suggesting it is not a factor in her longevity.

## Blood Biomarkers

### Liver Function
*   **ALT & AST:** Within decent ranges.
*   **Alkaline Phosphatase:** 75 U/L (Lower values are associated with reduced all-cause mortality; 75 is considered not bad for her age).
*   **GGT, Bilirubin (conjugated):** Decent values, not extreme.
*   **Albumin:** 46.4 g/L (Excellent levels, indicative of biological youth; levels decrease with age).
*   **Total Protein:** 80 g/L
    *   **Globulins:** 33.6 g/L (Calculated as Total Protein - Albumin)
        *   Note: Higher globulin levels can indicate potential underlying infectious issues. Values around 25 g/L are associated with reduced all-cause mortality.

### Lipid Profile
*   **Total Cholesterol:** 215 mg/dL (Superficially may seem high by reference range).
*   **Triglycerides:** 98 mg/dL (Values <90 mg/dL are associated with reduced all-cause mortality; 98 is close).
*   **HDL Cholesterol:** 62 mg/dL (Very good for her age).
*   **LDL Cholesterol:** 133 mg/dL (Elevated by reference range, but higher LDL levels are associated with lower all-cause mortality in individuals over 75-80).
    *   Note: The subject's lipid profile is considered good when accounting for the age-related association of higher LDL with reduced mortality.

### Kidney Function & Other Circulating Biomarkers
*   **Creatinine:** 1.25 mg/dL
*   **eGFR (Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate):** 35 mL/min/1.73m² (Very low, indicative of significantly reduced kidney function; biological youth eGFR is around 100).
*   **Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN):** Close to 30 mg/dL (Represents urea levels; values <15 mg/dL are associated with lowest risk of all-cause mortality).
    *   Note: Elevated urea and low eGFR indicate poor kidney function.
*   **Glucose:** 108 mg/dL (Prediabetic).
*   **Uric Acid:** Good levels (Unexpected given kidney function, and a marker of kidney function).
*   **C-Reactive Protein (CRP):** 1.13 mg/L (Low inflammation; values close to zero are associated with reduced all-cause mortality and are found in biological youth).

### Hematological Parameters
*   **Red Blood Cells (RBC):** 3.9 x 10^6/µL (Within a reasonable range; values closer to 4.5 x 10^6/µL are found in biological youth).
*   **Hemoglobin:** High (Indicates good oxygen-carrying capacity per RBC).
*   **Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV):** 100.8 fL (Very high; biological youth values are around 88 fL. High MCV is associated with increased all-cause mortality).
*   **Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW):** 17.4% (High; reduced all-cause mortality is associated with RDW values closer to 12.5% or less. High RDW indicates variation in RBC size).
*   **Leukocytes (Total White Blood Cells):** 7.55 x 10^3/µL (Within reference range, but values <6 x 10^3/µL or in the 3.5-6 range are associated with reduced all-cause mortality).
*   **Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR):** ~1.8 (Values <2 are considered good; values closer to 1 are ideal).
*   **Lymphocytes:** 2.55 x 10^3/µL (Excellent levels, indicative of a strong immune response; lymphocytes decrease with age and are severely depleted in severe COVID-19).

## Summary of Findings
*   **Good News:**
    *   Liver function appears good.
    *   High albumin levels are indicative of biological youth.
    *   Lipid profile is generally good for her age, with higher HDL and LDL associated with reduced mortality risk in older adults.
    *   Low inflammation (CRP).
    *   High lymphocyte counts suggest a robust immune system.
*   **Bad News:**
    *   Relatively high globulin levels.
    *   Reduced kidney function (eGFR 35).
    *   Prediabetic glucose levels.
    *   Large red blood cells (high MCV) and high RDW are associated with increased mortality risk.

## Potential for Improvement
*   **Dietary Fiber Intake:** Meta-analyses of RCTs show that increasing dietary fiber can improve kidney function (reducing creatinine and BUN) and reduce glucose levels.
    *   **Subject's Diet:** Rarely consumed sugar/desserts but frequently consumed bread and pasta.
    *   **Recommendation:** Exchanging refined bread and pasta for higher-fiber foods, including vegetables, could potentially improve kidney function and glucose control.
