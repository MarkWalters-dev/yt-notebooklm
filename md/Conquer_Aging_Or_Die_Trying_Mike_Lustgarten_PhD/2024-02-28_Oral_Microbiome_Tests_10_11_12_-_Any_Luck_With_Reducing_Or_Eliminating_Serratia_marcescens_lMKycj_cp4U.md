# 2024-02-28 Oral Microbiome Tests 10 11 12 - Any Luck With Reducing Or Eliminating Serratia marcescens

## Executive Summary

*   *Serratia marcescens* is a prominent bacterium in the oral microbiome, frequently dominating levels up to 96% and implicated in conditions like pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis.
*   A homemade mouthwash containing 1% xylitol, 1% sodium bicarbonate, and peppermint oil has shown inconsistent results, achieving 0% *Serratia marcescens* in some tests but failing in others (88-95%).
*   *In vitro* studies suggest 5% xylitol can reduce *Serratia marcescens* by 80%, but a personal test at this concentration resulted in 96% *Serratia marcescens*.
*   While *in vitro* data indicated an inverse correlation between sodium chloride concentration and *Serratia marcescens* levels, a mouthwash with 4% total sodium led to the highest recorded *Serratia marcescens* levels (97.3%). However, a modified 2% total sodium mouthwash (1% sodium bicarbonate + 1% sodium chloride) successfully achieved 0% *Serratia marcescens* in a subsequent test.
*   Future investigations involve vanillin, which *in vitro* studies demonstrate can eliminate *Serratia marcescens* at concentrations of 1% or 0.55% within 8-48 hours. Results from personal tests (13 and 14) are pending.

## Oral Microbiome Baseline Data

*Serratia marcescens* (also referred to as *Serratia*) is a bacterium found in the salivary microbiome, linked to adverse human health conditions including pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis.

Initial analysis of nine oral microbiome tests revealed high levels of *Serratia marcescens*, ranging from 88% to 96% of the total bacterial composition in six of those tests.

## Homemade Mouthwash Efficacy and Composition

A homemade mouthwash has shown variable success in limiting *Serratia marcescens*. In two out of five applications, *Serratia marcescens* levels were 0%. However, in another two of those five tests, levels remained high at 88-95%.

### Homemade Mouthwash Composition:

*   1% Xylitol
*   1% Sodium Bicarbonate
*   2-3 drops of Peppermint oil

## Test 10: Standard Mouthwash Protocol

For Test 10, the standard homemade mouthwash was used to further evaluate its effect on *Serratia marcescens* levels.

### Protocol:

*   Used the homemade mouthwash 3-5 times per day.

### Result:

*   *Serratia marcescens* levels were 0%. This brings the total successful eradications to three out of six tests where the homemade mouthwash was employed.

## Xylitol Investigation

Published *in vitro* data suggests that 5% xylitol solutions can reduce *Serratia marcescens* levels by approximately 80%. However, a previous personal test using 5% xylitol resulted in 96% *Serratia marcescens*. Given this outcome, higher doses of xylitol have not been pursued.

## Sodium Concentration Investigation

The homemade mouthwash contains sodium through 1% sodium bicarbonate. *In vitro* data exists for sodium chloride reducing *Serratia marcescens* levels. This data shows an inverse correlation: higher levels of sodium chloride were associated with reduced *Serratia marcescens*, while lower levels were associated with higher *Serratia marcescens*. This correlation was observed at a pH of 7 and 30 degrees Celsius. It is important to note these are *in vitro* findings, with no published randomized clinical trials yet available.

## Test 11: High Sodium Mouthwash Protocol

Based on the *in vitro* inverse correlation, an attempt was made to increase the sodium concentration in the mouthwash.

### Protocol:

*   Added approximately 3% sodium chloride (using sea salt) to the homemade mouthwash.
*   This resulted in a total sodium concentration of 4% (1% from sodium bicarbonate + 3% from sodium chloride).
*   The mouthwash was used for two weeks prior to the test.

### Result:

*   For Test 11, *Serratia marcescens* levels reached a new high of 97.3%.

## Test 12: Modified Sodium Mouthwash Protocol

Considering the unexpected high *Serratia marcescens* levels with 4% total sodium, a U-shaped curve hypothesis was considered, suggesting an optimal sodium concentration might exist between very low and very high levels.

### Protocol:

*   Added 1% sodium chloride (using sea salt) to the pre-existing standard mouthwash.
*   This resulted in a total mouthwash composition of 1% sodium bicarbonate and 1% sodium chloride.
*   The mouthwash was used for two weeks prior to the test.

### Result:

*   For Test 12, *Serratia marcescens* levels were 0%.

## Overall Mouthwash Efficacy Summary

Across eight tests utilizing the standard or modified homemade mouthwash, four instances resulted in 0% *Serratia marcescens*, while four instances showed the bacterium was still present. The precise recipe for consistently eliminating *Serratia marcescens* remains under investigation.

## Vanillin Investigation (Tests 13 & 14)

Vanillin, a metabolite responsible for the characteristic smell of vanilla beans, has shown promise in reducing *Serratia marcescens* in *in vitro* studies. These studies, again, lack published randomized controlled trial data.

*In vitro* data indicates that 1% vanillin almost completely eliminated *Serratia marcescens* within eight hours when compared to a control condition. A lower dose of 0.55% vanillin also completely eliminated *Serratia marcescens* within approximately 48 hours.

### Future Protocol:

*   **Test 13:** Use 1% vanillin.
*   **Test 14:** Use 0.6% vanillin.

### Current Status:

*   Results for Test 13 are in but not yet presented.
*   Results for Test 14 are still pending.
