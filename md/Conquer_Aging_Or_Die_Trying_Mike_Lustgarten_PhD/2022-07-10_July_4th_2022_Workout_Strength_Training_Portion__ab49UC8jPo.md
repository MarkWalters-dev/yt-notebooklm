# 2022-07-10 July 4th 2022 Workout Strength Training Portion

## Executive Summary
*   All exercises emphasize a full range of motion to build comprehensive strength.
*   Workout frequency is once every 3-4 days to optimize recovery and long-term strength maintenance.
*   Rep targets are standardized for each exercise to ensure consistent strength and prevent plateaus, with progressive overload aiming to increase reps over time to resist age-related decline.
*   Injury prevention is prioritized through controlled form and moderate weights, particularly due to a history of herniated discs, over "ego lifting."
*   Workout structure incorporates active recovery or "semi-supersets" by alternating muscle groups (e.g., legs during bicep/lat recovery) for efficiency.

## Pulling Movements

### Pull-ups
*   **Previous high:** 12 reps in 2020 and 2021.
*   **Goal:** At least 12 strict reps.
*   **Form:** Full extension and full flexion, chin above the bar, legs crossed to prevent feet from touching the ground.
*   **Sets:**
    *   Set 1: 13 reps (pronated grip).
    *   Set 2: 1 rep (inside/supinated grip).
    *   Set 3: 3 reps (pronated grip).
    *   Set 4: 1 rep (inside/supinated grip).
    *   Set 5: 3 reps (pronated grip).
    *   Set 6: 1 rep (inside/supinated grip).

### Seated Row (Home Adaptation)
*   **Goal:** 13 reps, aiming to increase reps over time to resist age-related decline.
*   **Sets:** Two work sets.
    *   Set 1: 13 reps.
    *   Set 2: 13 reps. Future consideration to add a weight vest for increased resistance.

## Squatting & Lower Body Warm-up

### ATG Squats
*   **Purpose:** Warm up hips and thighs in anticipation of heavier squats and deadlifts.
*   **Form:** Full depth with strict lower back form.
*   **Sets (integrated as semi-supersets):**
    *   Set 1 (after initial pull-ups): 3 bodyweight reps.
    *   Set 2 (after further pull-ups): 3 reps, holding 10 pounds in each hand.
    *   Set 3 (after overhead press warm-up): 5 reps, with 70-90 pounds on the back.

## Overhead Press

### Warm-up
*   20 pounds (bar is approximately 22 pounds), 20 reps.

### Overhead Shoulder Press (Strict Form)
*   **Current Body Weight:** 152 pounds.
*   **Form:** Strict, no leaning back, full range of motion (all the way down, all the way up). Consistent rep targets are maintained across workouts to standardize and prevent strength loss.
*   **Sets:**
    *   Set 1: 70 pounds (a little less than half bodyweight), 12 reps. This is a consistent rep goal.
    *   Set 2: 90 pounds (sometimes 110-120 pounds), 5 reps. This is a consistent rep goal, maintaining strict form.

## Trapezius Strength

### Shrugs
*   **Approach:** Performed in 2-3 minute bursts to build strength endurance, holding the weight for the entire duration.
*   **Integration:** Incorporated after deadlift sets.
*   **Form:** Bending knees for added momentum when using heavier weights.
*   **Goal:** Maintain muscle mass in the traps, as it's easy to lose without consistent shrugging.

## Deadlifts (Trap Bar)

### Warm-up
*   **Initial:** 45 pounds (bar held upside down to achieve greater range of motion).
*   **Second Warm-up:** 95 pounds. Focus on keeping the back arched and tight, correcting for any rounding of the upper back.

### Working Sets
*   **Set 1:** 135 pounds, 5 reps. Technique emphasizes a tight lower back, no rounding, decent depth, and controlled lowering of the weight.
*   **Set 2:** 155 pounds, 5 reps. This weight balances minimizing injury risk (due to a history of herniated discs) with optimizing strength. Heavier loads (e.g., 175 pounds) are avoided to prevent potential back injury.

## Pushing Movements

### Ball Push-ups (Feet on Ball)
*   **Form:** Full range of motion. Toes are pointed on the ball, which adds a balance challenge to the exercise.
*   **Sets:** Two work sets.
    *   Set 1: 23 reps. This represents an improvement in strength from 17 reps when the exercise was first started two years prior.
    *   Set 2: 17 reps. This is a consistent rep target, with the goal of slowly increasing reps over time to counteract age-related strength decline.

## Knee & Ankle Strength

### Knees Over Toes Inspired Exercise
*   **Source:** Derived from the "Knees Over Toes" methodology.
*   **Purpose:** Builds strength in the knees and ankles.
*   **Protocol:**
    *   Warm up the knees for a few reps.
    *   Perform Reverse Nordics, aiming for full range of motion (back to the floor).
    *   **Reps:** 12-15 reps, adjusted based on knee comfort on a given day.
*   **Superset:** Immediately followed by a hamstring stretch to provide a momentary break for the quadriceps, knees, and ankles, which are heavily involved in the preceding movement.

## Stretches
*   **Inverted L:** Stretches the upper back.
*   **Cat Pose:** Stretches the lower back.
*   **Hamstring Stretch:** Performed as a superset with the knees-over-toes exercise.
