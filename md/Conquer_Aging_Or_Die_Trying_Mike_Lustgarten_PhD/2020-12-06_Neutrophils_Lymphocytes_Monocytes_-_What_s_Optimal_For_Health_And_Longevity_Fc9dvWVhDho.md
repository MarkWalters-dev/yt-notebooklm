# 2020-12-06 Neutrophils Lymphocytes Monocytes - What s Optimal For Health And Longevity

### Executive Summary

*   An optimal total white blood cell (WBC) count for longevity, identified in subjects starting from their fifties, is between 3,500 and 6,000 cells per microliter, associated with a ~37-year life expectancy. Levels above 6,000 are linked to significantly shorter lifespans.
*   Specific optimal ranges for individual WBC subtypes associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk are: Neutrophils (2,000-3,000/microliter), Lymphocytes (1,900-2,100/microliter), and Monocytes (~400/microliter).
*   For all three major WBC subtypes, both excessively low and excessively high counts (outside the optimal range) are associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality.
*   Age-related changes show that neutrophil and monocyte levels generally increase with age in men and post-menopausal women, while lymphocyte levels consistently decline with age.
*   Pregnancy significantly influences neutrophil and monocyte levels in women, explaining the biphasic age-related trends observed for these cell types.

## Total White Blood Cell Count and Life Expectancy

White blood cells (WBCs) include neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, basophils, and lymphocytes. Neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes together comprise approximately 99% of the total WBC content.

**Study:** Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA)
*   **Subjects:** ~2,800
*   **Follow-up:** Up to 44 years
*   **Reference Range:** 3,400 to 10,800 WBCs/microliter. This range indicates population averages but not necessarily optimal levels for health and longevity.

**Life Expectancy (starting from subjects in their fifties, based on initial WBC count):**
*   **3,500 - 6,000 WBCs/microliter:** Associated with the longest life expectancy (~37 years).
*   **6,000 - 10,000 WBCs/microliter:** Associated with a significantly shorter life expectancy (~30 years, 7 years shorter than the optimal range).
*   **> 10,000 WBCs/microliter:** Associated with a life expectancy of ~27 years (10 years shorter than the optimal range).
*   **< 3,500 WBCs/microliter:** This group appeared to have the shortest life expectancy. However, due to a small sample size (49 subjects), the authors could not statistically determine if this was significantly associated with reduced life expectancy compared to other groups.

## Neutrophils

*   **Reference Range:** 1,400 to 7,000 neutrophils/microliter.

**Age-Related Changes (Study: ~378,000 subjects):**
*   **Men:** Neutrophil levels consistently increase from age 20 through 90.
*   **Women:** Levels increase from approximately 5,000 to ~6,500/microliter up to the mid-thirties, then decline until the mid-fifties, and subsequently increase again until age 90.
*   **Explanation for Women's Biphasic Pattern:** Pregnancy is a significant factor. Pregnant women exhibit higher average neutrophil levels (~5,300/microliter) compared to non-pregnant women (~4,100/microliter). This pattern in women is explained by:
    *   An increased proportion of pregnant women in younger cohorts (up to age 35) compared to 20-year-olds.
    *   A decrease in pregnancy frequency from age 35 to 55, explaining the neutrophil decline.
    *   A post-menopausal increase similar to men.

**All-Cause Mortality Risk (Study: >775,000 subjects):**
*   **Optimal Range:** 2,000 to 3,000 neutrophils/microliter was associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Increased Risk:** Neutrophil counts less than 2,000 and greater than 3,000/microliter were associated with a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk.

## Lymphocytes

*   **Reference Range:** 700 to 3,100 lymphocytes/microliter (this range can vary by lab).

**Age-Related Changes (Study: ~108,000 subjects):**
*   Youth (around 20 years old) is characterized by higher lymphocyte levels.
*   Lymphocyte levels consistently decline with increasing age, continuing up to 100 years old.
*   While the proportion of variance in lymphocyte count explained by age (R-squared) is relatively small at 0.07, the decline during aging is a consistent and statistically significant effect (p < 0.001).

**All-Cause Mortality Risk (Study: ~108,000 subjects):**
*   **Optimal Range:** 1,900 to 2,100 lymphocytes/microliter was associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Increased Risk:**
    *   Levels less than 1,900 lymphocytes/microliter were associated with a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   Higher levels, greater than approximately 3,000 lymphocytes/microliter, were also associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   Very low lymphocyte counts (< 1,000/microliter) appear to carry a greater all-cause mortality risk compared to moderately elevated counts (~3,000/microliter).

## Monocytes

*   **Reference Range:** 100 to 900 monocytes/microliter.

**Age-Related Changes:**
*   **Men:** Monocyte levels show a steady increase from age 20 to 90.
*   **Women:** Levels exhibit a biphasic response: an increase from age 20 to approximately 35, a decrease from 35 to 55, and then a steady increase up to age 90.
*   **Explanation for Women's Biphasic Pattern:** Pregnancy significantly impacts monocyte levels, which are observed to increase during the trimesters:
    *   First Trimester: ~490 monocytes/microliter
    *   Second Trimester: ~530 monocytes/microliter
    *   Third Trimester: ~620 monocytes/microliter
    *   The observed differences between trimesters are statistically significant. This increase during pregnancy explains the initial rise in women's monocyte levels, followed by a decline as pregnancy frequency decreases, and then a post-menopausal age-related increase.

**All-Cause Mortality Risk (Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) & Non-CVD Mortality):**
*   **Optimal Range:** Approximately 400 monocytes/microliter was associated with the lowest risk of both CVD-related and non-CVD-related mortality.
*   **Increased Risk (CVD Mortality):** Increasing risk for levels less than ~250 and greater than ~400 monocytes/microliter.
*   **Increased Risk (Non-CVD Mortality):** Increasing risk for levels less than 400 and greater than ~550 monocytes/microliter.
*   *Note:* While age-related data suggested 530 (women) and 550 (men) monocytes/microliter as indicative of youth, mortality data indicates that lower values (~400/microliter) may be optimal for reduced mortality risk.

## Optimal White Blood Cell Subtype Ranges

The initial data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging indicated an optimal total WBC range of 3,500 to 6,000 cells per microliter for longest life expectancy. By examining the individual components, more specific optimal ranges can be identified for all-cause mortality risk:

*   **Neutrophils:** 2,000 - 3,000/microliter
*   **Lymphocytes:** 1,900 - 2,100/microliter
*   **Monocytes:** ~400/microliter

Summing the mid-points or ranges of these optimal subtype counts (neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes) yields a combined range of approximately 4,300 to 5,500/microliter. This refined range falls squarely within the initially identified optimal total WBC range of 3,500 to 6,000/microliter. Eosinophils and basophils, which constitute only about 1% of the total WBC pool, are not included in this sum but would not significantly alter this overall optimal range.
