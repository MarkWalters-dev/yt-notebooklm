# 2025-12-28 S-adenosyl-methionine - A Key Player For Lowering Homocysteine

## Executive Summary

*   Current supplementation strategies using high-dose Betaine (TMG) and prior strategies using a B-vitamin complex (B12, methylfolate, B6) failed to significantly lower homocysteine below $9.3 \mu M$.
*   NAD levels showed a significant increase ($21 \mu M$ to $48 \mu M$) when switching from Nicotinamide supplementation to NMN supplementation, suggesting NMN is superior for rapid NAD elevation.
*   Homocysteine levels exhibited a significant inverse correlation ($r=-0.55$) with the indirect measure of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) availability, indicated by the Sarcosine/Glycine ratio.
*   The synthesis of creatine from Guanidinoacetic Acid (GAA) consumes SAM; therefore, creatine supplementation is proposed as a strategy to spare endogenous SAM, potentially lowering homocysteine.

## Background and Testing Protocol

The analysis uses data collected over a 41-day period (September 17th to October 26th, 2025) between blood test six and seven, correlating supplement intake with biomarkers.

### Prescription Medication
*   Hypothyroidism managed with:
    *   Levothyroxine: $75 \mu g$ per day.
    *   Cytomel: $20 \mu g$ per day.

### Supplementation Targeting NAD Precursors
Supplements were taken on separate days to isolate effects:
*   Nicotinic Acid: Averaged $17 \text{ mg/day}$ over the 41-day period (intermittently used).
*   Nicotinamide: Averaged $98 \text{ mg/day}$ over the 41-day period (intermittently used, approximately $500 \text{ mg}$ every five days).
*   NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide): Averaged $1,000 \text{ mg/day}$ for the 17 days preceding the test (Oct 10th – Oct 26th).
    *   Dose was lowered to $375 \text{ mg/day}$ for the four days immediately before testing due to onset of headaches at higher doses.

### NAD Test Results
| Precursor Used | Average NAD Level | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Nicotinamide (Test 6) | $21 \mu M$ | Baseline using Nicotinamide exclusively. |
| NMN (Test 7) | $48 \mu M$ | Significant increase; Genfinity flags $>40 \mu M$ as optimal. |

The inclusion of the mononucleotide structure in NMN provided a substantial boost in NAD levels compared to using Nicotinamide alone.

## Homocysteine Metabolism and Supplementation Attempts

Homocysteine is implicated as neurotoxic and a driver of endothelial cell senescence.

### Homocysteine Test Results
*   **Homocysteine Level (Test 7):** $9.3 \mu M$.
*   **Reference Range Flag:** Considered "good" (below the high threshold of $15 \mu M$).
*   **Personal Target:** $<5 \mu M$, avoiding age-related increase (Flagged with a Red X).

### Failed Homocysteine Lowering Attempts (Test 6 vs Test 7)
| Supplement Change | Test 6 Level | Test 7 Level | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Increased Betaine (TMG) | $8.8 \mu M$ | $9.3 \mu M$ | Moved slightly in the wrong direction despite $3.5\times$ dose increase to $\approx 5 \text{ g/day}$. |
| B-Vitamin Complex Removal | $8.8 \mu M$ (w/ complex) | $9.3 \mu M$ (w/o complex) | Removed supplement containing $1,000 \mu g$ B12, $400 \mu g$ methylfolate, and $1.5 \text{ mg}$ B6. |

### Folate Pathway Analysis (Homocysteine $\rightarrow$ Methionine)
This pathway relies on Folate and B12 to maximize Methionine Synthase activity.
1.  Dietary Folate $\xrightarrow{\text{MTHFR (requires FAD)}}$ Serum Folate
2.  Serum Folate + Vitamin B12 $\xrightarrow{\text{Methionine Synthase}}$ Methionine
3.  Methionine $\rightarrow$ S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)

**Riboflavin Supplementation:**
*   Average intake: $12 \text{ mg/day}$ (approx. $10\times$ RDA).
*   Rationale: Riboflavin is required for FAD synthesis, which is necessary for MTHFR activity.

**B12/Methylfolate Removal Rationale:**
*   Dietary intake was deemed sufficient:
    *   B12 average intake: $63 \mu g/\text{day}$ (RDA $2.4 \mu g/\text{day}$).
    *   Folate average intake: $1,000 \mu g/\text{day}$ ($2.5\times$ RDA).

### Betaine Pathway Analysis (Homocysteine $\rightarrow$ Methionine)
This pathway uses the enzyme BHMT.
$$\text{Homocysteine} + \text{Betaine (TMG)} \xrightarrow{\text{BHMT (requires Zinc)}} \text{Methionine}$$
*   **Zinc Supplementation:** $15 \text{ mg/day}$ was maintained, bringing total zinc to $\approx 30 \text{ mg/day}$ (Below the $40 \text{ mg/day}$ upper limit).

### Transsulfuration Pathway Analysis (Homocysteine $\rightarrow$ Cystathionine)
This pathway reduces homocysteine by converting it to Cystathionine, which leads to Cysteine and eventually Glutathione.
$$\text{Homocysteine} + \text{Serine} + \text{Vitamin B6} \xrightarrow{\text{CBS (Cystathionine Beta Synthase)}} \text{Cystathionine}$$

## S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as the Key Bottleneck

SAM is central to methylation reactions, and its production declines with aging due to decreased ATP availability for its synthesis from Methionine. Low SAM may cause a buildup of homocysteine by limiting the CBS pathway and inhibiting MTHFR.

$$\text{Methionine} \xrightarrow{\text{ATP}} \text{SAM}$$

### SAM Measurement Index
SAM levels are indirectly indexed using the plasma ratio of Sarcosine to Glycine, catalyzed by Glycine N-Methyltransferase (GMT):
$$\text{SAM} + \text{Glycine} \xrightarrow{\text{GMT}} \text{Sarcosine}$$

**Correlation Analysis:**
*   Plotting the Sarcosine/Glycine ratio (Index of SAM) vs. Homocysteine levels showed a **significant inverse correlation ($r=-0.55, P < 0.05$)**.
*   This suggests that when SAM availability (high S/G ratio) is higher, homocysteine levels tend to be lower.

### New Strategy: Creatine Supplementation to Spare SAM

The rationale is that supplementing creatine reduces the need for the liver to synthesize it, thereby sparing endogenous SAM.
$$\text{Guanidinoacetic Acid (GAA)} + \text{SAM} \xrightarrow{\text{Liver}} \text{Creatine}$$

*   **Proposed Intervention:** Creatine supplementation at a starting dose of $2 \text{ g/day}$, based on the estimated requirement for a $63.5 \text{ kg}$ male.
*   **Goal:** To increase SAM availability (higher Sarcosine/Glycine ratio) and subsequently reduce homocysteine below $9 \mu M$ in the next blood test (Test 8, scheduled for December 15th, 2025).
