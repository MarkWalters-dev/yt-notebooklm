# 2023-12-24 NMN vs Nicotinic Acid - Which Is Better For Increasing NAD

## Executive Summary

*   Supplementing with 600 mg/day of nicotinic acid for 9 days increased NAD levels to 67.4 µM, 2-3 times higher than baseline (20-25 µM).
*   This high-dose nicotinic acid was associated with a statistically significant outlier in epigenetic aging (Dunedin Pace score of 0.98, compared to an average of 0.8, representing more than four standard deviations from the mean).
*   Supplementing with 2000 mg/day of NMN for 11 days also increased NAD levels to a comparable high range (61 µM); the effect on epigenetic aging is pending.
*   Nicotinic acid appears more potent for increasing NAD levels than NMN: 60 mg/day of nicotinic acid raised NAD to approximately 40 µM (without flushing), while 1000 mg/day of NMN was required to achieve a similar NAD increase.
*   Flushing was experienced at 600 mg/day of nicotinic acid, but not at 60 mg/day.

## Nicotinic Acid and NAD Levels

On July 5, 2023, an experiment was conducted to assess the impact of high-dose nicotinic acid on NAD levels.

*   **Protocol:** Supplemented with 600 mg of nicotinic acid per day for 9 days.
*   **Measurement:** Blood sent to Genfinity for NAD analysis.
*   **Result:** NAD levels increased to 67.4 µM. This value is approximately two to three times higher than baseline NAD levels (20-25 µM), which are considered relatively low.

## Dunedin Pace Outlier Analysis

On the same day as the high NAD measurement, the epigenetic pace of aging, as measured by Dunedin Pace, was also assessed.

*   **Measurement:** Dunedin Pace value recorded as 0.98.
*   **Interpretation:** A value of 0.98 indicates an epigenetic aging rate of 1 year for every 1 year of chronological aging. An ideal (slowest) epigenetic pace of aging is around 0.6. This result was considered poor.
*   **Hypothesis:** This raised the question of whether the high-dose nicotinic acid induced this outlier result.

To evaluate if 0.98 was an outlier, an analysis of nine Dunedin Pace tests from 2022 and 2023 was performed:

*   The average Dunedin Pace score from the eight tests *excluding* the 0.98 value was 0.8.
*   The standard deviation for these eight tests was 0.043.
*   The 0.98 value was more than four standard deviations away from the average (0.8).
*   **Conclusion:** Generally, a data point more than three standard deviations from the average is considered an outlier. Therefore, the 0.98 Dunedin Pace score is indeed an outlier, likely or probably caused by the high dose of nicotinic acid.

## NMN for NAD Increase and Dunedin Pace Experiment

A follow-up experiment was initiated to determine if an equally high NAD level, achieved using NMN, would also result in an outlier Dunedin Pace score.

**Objective:** To investigate if increasing NAD to greater than 60 µM using NMN will lead to another outlier Dunedin Pace score.

**Methodology (Phase 1 - NAD Increase):**

*   Supplemented with 2 grams of NMN per day for 11 days.
*   Blood collected on December 11 for NAD analysis (Genfinity).
*   **Result:** NAD levels increased to 61 µM.

**Methodology (Phase 2 - Dunedin Pace Measurement):**

*   Dunedin Pace results from TrueDiagnostic are currently pending.

## Potency Comparison: Nicotinic Acid vs. NMN

Based on the experiments conducted, a comparison of the efficacy of nicotinic acid and NMN in raising NAD levels can be made:

*   **High Dose Comparison:** 2000 mg/day of NMN raised NAD to 61 µM, which is comparable to the NAD increase (67.4 µM) achieved with 600 mg/day of nicotinic acid. This suggests that a significantly lower dose of nicotinic acid can achieve similar NAD elevations as a higher dose of NMN.
*   **Moderate Dose Comparison:**
    *   60 mg/day of nicotinic acid raised NAD to approximately 40 µM, notably without causing a flush.
    *   1000 mg/day of NMN was required to raise NAD to approximately 40 µM.
*   **Conclusion:** Nicotinic acid appears to be more potent than NMN for increasing NAD levels, with lower doses eliciting comparable or even higher NAD elevations. Flushing was observed with 600 mg/day nicotinic acid, but not with 60 mg/day.
