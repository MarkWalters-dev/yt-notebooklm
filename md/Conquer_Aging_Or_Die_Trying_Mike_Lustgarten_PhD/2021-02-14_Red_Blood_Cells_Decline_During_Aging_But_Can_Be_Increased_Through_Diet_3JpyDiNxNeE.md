# 2021-02-14 Red Blood Cells Decline During Aging But Can Be Increased Through Diet

## Executive Summary

*   Red blood cells (erythrocytes) comprise approximately 84% of total human cells, and their levels decrease significantly with aging.
*   Personal dietary changes led to a reversal of an age-related decline in red blood cell counts, surpassing previous baseline levels.
*   A strong positive correlation (r=0.91, p<0.05) was observed between increased daily yogurt intake and higher red blood cell counts.
*   Conversely, whey protein intake showed a significant inverse correlation (r= -0.61, p<0.05) with red blood cell levels, indicating the whey fraction is likely not the active component.
*   The observed increase in red blood cell count was not due to dehydration, as plasma osmolarity remained stable or showed a trend towards lower values during periods of higher red blood cell counts.

## Red Blood Cell Basics and Age-Related Decline

Red blood cells, or erythrocytes, are the most abundant cell type in the human body, accounting for approximately 25 trillion out of 30 trillion total human cells, or 84%.

Red blood cell levels decline during aging. For a 20-year-old:
*   **Men:** Approximately 4.8 million red blood cells per microliter (totaling about 25 trillion in an average 70kg man with 5 liters of blood).
*   **Women:** Approximately 4.3 million red blood cells per microliter (totaling about 17 trillion in a woman with 4 liters of blood).

By later age, red blood cell levels can decline to around 3.9 million red blood cells per microliter. Higher red blood cell counts are generally beneficial as they increase oxygen-carrying capacity, supporting cellular metabolic work and energy production. Lower counts can lead to a greater reliance on less efficient glycolysis for ATP generation. This age-related decrease in red blood cell levels appears to be reversible through diet.

## Personal Data: Reversing Red Blood Cell Decline

The speaker tracked personal circulating biochemistry for over 15 years, with red blood cell data available since 2008.

*   **2008-2013 (6 measurements):** Average red blood cell count was 4.96 million cells/µL, which was relatively high for chronological age at the time.
*   **2015-2019 (16 measurements, increased tracking frequency):** Average red blood cell count significantly decreased to 4.62 million cells/µL. This value aligned closely with the expected age-related decline for the speaker's chronological age during this period.
*   **2019-2020 (8 measurements, post-dietary intervention):** Average red blood cell count increased to 5.08 million cells/µL, surpassing both age-related expectations and previous personal baseline levels.

This reversal suggests that the age-related decline in red blood cells is not an inevitable process and can be influenced by lifestyle, specifically diet.

## Dietary Analysis: Yogurt and Red Blood Cells

The primary dietary change attributed to the increase in red blood cell counts was the inclusion of yogurt.

Data analyzed from 2015 to 2020 showed a clear relationship between yogurt intake and red blood cell levels:
*   **Prior to Yogurt Intake (2015-2019):** For approximately three and a half years with no yogurt in the diet, red blood cell counts ranged from a low of 4.45 to a high of 4.8 million cells/µL.
*   **After Yogurt Inclusion (Starting September 2019):** With a daily intake of 250 grams or more of yogurt (up to 450 grams/day), red blood cell counts consistently remained above 4.9 million cells/µL.

A strong positive correlation was found between average daily yogurt intake and red blood cell count:
*   **Correlation Coefficient (r):** 0.91 (indicating a very strong positive correlation)
*   **R-squared value:** 82% of the variability in red blood cells could be explained by yogurt intake.
*   **P-value:** Statistically significant (p<0.05).

## Exploring Other Dairy Products

Milk is composed of whey and cheese (curds) fractions. Yogurt is fermented milk. To investigate which component of dairy might be driving the effect, other dairy products were analyzed.

*   **Whey Protein Intake:** A significant inverse correlation was observed between whey protein intake and red blood cell levels.
    *   **Correlation Coefficient (r):** -0.61 (indicating a significant negative correlation)
    *   **R-squared value:** 38% of the variability in red blood cells was explained by whey protein intake.
    *   **P-value:** Statistically significant (p<0.05).
    This finding suggests that the whey fraction of milk is unlikely to be responsible for the observed increase in red blood cells from yogurt consumption.

*   **Cheese Intake:** The correlation between average daily cheese intake and red blood cell levels over a two-and-a-half-year period was not statistically significant, despite a visual upward trend.

**Hypothesis on Lactobacillus:**
The speaker's microbiome composition was measured three times between 2017 and February 2019, prior to the inclusion of yogurt. During this period, there was no detectable *Lactobacillus* in the gut, a genus of bacteria well-known in yogurt products. It is hypothesized that *Lactobacillus* may be involved in driving erythropoiesis (the production of new red blood cells), though no published data directly linking *Lactobacillus* to erythropoiesis currently exists.

## Investigating Dehydration as a Factor

To rule out dehydration as a cause for the apparent increase in red blood cell counts, plasma osmolarity was calculated. A higher plasma osmolarity indicates greater dehydration.

**Plasma Osmolarity Calculation:**
Plasma Osmolarity (mmol/L) = (2 * Sodium concentration) + (Glucose / 18) + (Blood Urea Nitrogen / 2.8)

Analysis of the speaker's blood test results for sodium, glucose, and blood urea nitrogen showed:
*   **2015-2019 (pre-yogurt):** Average plasma osmolarity was approximately 291 mmol/L.
*   **2019-2020 (post-yogurt):** Average plasma osmolarity was approximately 289 mmol/L.

A t-test comparing these two periods yielded a p-value of 0.06, indicating a trend towards *lower* osmolarity during the period of higher red blood cell counts. This suggests that the increase in red blood cells was not due to dehydration; rather, the individual was potentially *more* hydrated during the period of increased red blood cells, thus strengthening the dietary link.
