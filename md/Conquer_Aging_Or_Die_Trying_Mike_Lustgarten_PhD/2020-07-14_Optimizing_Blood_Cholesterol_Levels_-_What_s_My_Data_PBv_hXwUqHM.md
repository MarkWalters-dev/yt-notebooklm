# 2020-07-14 Optimizing Blood Cholesterol Levels - What's My Data

## Executive Summary

*   The speaker's total cholesterol average is 145 mg/dL, which, for a 47-year-old, is associated with a 60% higher risk of all-cause mortality compared to individuals with cholesterol levels around 220 mg/dL.
*   Total cholesterol levels are strongly and positively correlated with saturated fat intake (correlation coefficient of 0.87). Higher saturated fat intake leads to higher total cholesterol.
*   Total cholesterol also shows moderate positive correlations with plasma glucose (correlation coefficient of 0.58) and plasma creatinine (correlation coefficient of 0.61).
*   A multivariate model indicates that glucose and creatinine together explain approximately 49% of the variance in total cholesterol levels.
*   Optimizing glucose (80-94 mg/dL) and creatinine (0.8-1.0 mg/dL) might suggest a total cholesterol range of 130-160 mg/dL, but this range is paradoxically associated with increased all-cause mortality risk for the speaker's age group.

## Personal Data Analysis: Total Cholesterol and Mortality Risk

*   **Average Total Cholesterol:** 145 mg/dL.
*   **Mortality Risk Association:** For a 47-year-old, a total cholesterol level of 145 mg/dL is associated with approximately 60% higher all-cause mortality risk compared to individuals with cholesterol levels around 220 mg/dL.

## Dietary Correlation: Saturated Fat Intake

*   **Methodology:**
    *   Weighed all food intake and logged it into an online app for macro and micronutrient tracking since 2015.
    *   Calculated the average dietary intake for periods corresponding to each blood test (e.g., average intake from Jan 2 to Feb 29 for a March 1 blood test).
*   **Finding:** Total cholesterol levels are most strongly correlated with saturated fat intake.
    *   **Correlation Coefficient:** 0.87
    *   **Trend:** Higher average daily saturated fat intake leads to higher total blood cholesterol levels.
    *   **Observation:** At a saturated fat intake of approximately 50 grams per day, the highest attained cholesterol level was around 180 mg/dL.

## Interplay with Other Biomarkers

### Glucose and Total Cholesterol

*   **Correlation Coefficient:** 0.58 (moderately strong and significant).
*   **Trend:** As total cholesterol levels increase, plasma glucose levels also tend to increase.

### Creatinine and Total Cholesterol

*   **Correlation Coefficient:** 0.61 (moderately strong and significant).
*   **Trend:** Higher total cholesterol levels are associated with higher plasma creatinine levels.

### Combined Impact of Glucose and Creatinine on Total Cholesterol

*   **Multivariate Model:** When glucose and creatinine are analyzed together in a model predicting total cholesterol:
    *   **Correlation Coefficient:** 0.7
    *   **R-squared (Variance Explained):** Approximately 49%. This indicates that glucose and creatinine together explain nearly half of the variability in total cholesterol.

## Deriving Optimal Biomarker Ranges

### Optimal Glucose Range

*   **General Optimal Range for Lowest All-Cause Mortality:** 80-94 mg/dL.
*   **Optimal Range for Biological Youth:** Around 85 mg/dL.
*   **Speaker's Likely Achievable Range:** 85-90 mg/dL.

### Optimal Creatinine Range

*   **General Optimal Range for Lowest All-Cause Mortality:** Around 0.8 mg/dL.
*   **Speaker's Likely Achievable Range:** 0.9-1.0 mg/dL.

### Potential Cholesterol Ranges Based on Glucose and Creatinine Optimization

*   **To potentially optimize glucose levels (closer to 80 mg/dL):** Total cholesterol range of 130-160 mg/dL.
*   **To potentially optimize creatinine levels (0.85-1.0 mg/dL):** Total cholesterol range of 130-150 mg/dL.
*   **Combined Optimization Suggestion:** A total cholesterol range of 130-150 mg/dL or 130-160 mg/dL might simultaneously optimize glucose and creatinine.

## The Biohacker's Dilemma

*   **Conflict:** The cholesterol levels (130-160 mg/dL) that may optimize glucose and creatinine are associated with a higher all-cause mortality risk for the speaker's age group, according to previous data.
*   **Conclusion:** It may not be possible to simultaneously optimize all biomarkers. The goal may be to optimize as many variables as possible without significantly worsening others.
