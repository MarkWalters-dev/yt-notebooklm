# 2025-05-11 Dave Pascoe Presents His Blood Test Results: 41 Biomarkers

## Executive Summary

*   **Biological Age Trend:** Dave Pascoe's biological age, as measured by PhenoAge, has shown an increasing trend over the years, though he has actively resisted a significant year-over-year increase, suggesting a slowing of the aging rate. This trend was impacted by significant stress and a COVID-19 infection in late 2024.
*   **Kidney Function Insights:** Creatinine levels have decreased, potentially influenced by reduced creatine supplementation due to travel. Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) has increased, which, if protein intake is stable, could suggest declining kidney function, but the decreasing uric acid levels are a positive sign. Cystatin C, a marker less sensitive to muscle mass, is being tracked due to its strong correlation with GrimAge.
*   **Liver Health Markers:** While AST and ALT are trending in a favorable direction, AST remains somewhat elevated. Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) is in an excellent range, associated with low liver disease mortality risk. Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) has shown variability, trending upwards recently, and is a marker to monitor.
*   **Thyroid Hormone Optimization:** Significant efforts have been made to optimize thyroid hormone levels, particularly T3 and T4, leading to changes in medication dosage and timing of tests. This process has involved a gradual reduction in T4 and the inclusion of T3, with ongoing adjustments to medication timing to align with natural circadian rhythms.
*   **Metabolic Health and Cardiovascular Risk:** HbA1c is trending upwards despite avoiding sugar, indicating a need for further investigation into contributing factors, potentially including the use of acarbose. While LDL levels are slightly elevated compared to the most optimal ranges, the interpretation is complex due to ongoing research and potential confounding factors like existing plaque.

## PhenoAge and Biological Aging

Dave Pascoe's PhenoAge data shows an increase in biological age over the years. While his chronological age has advanced, his PhenoAge has also advanced, indicating aging. However, he has demonstrated resistance to the typical year-over-year increase in PhenoAge, suggesting a potential slowing of his aging rate.

*   **2020-2024 Trend:** A general upward trend in PhenoAge is observed.
*   **2021-2025 Projection:** The average PhenoAge for 2025 was projected to be around 51.5-52, but his current data is around 48.65, indicating he has resisted that age-related increase.
*   **Factors Influencing Trend:** A significant increase in stress due to home remodeling and construction dust, followed by a COVID-19 infection in late 2024, likely contributed to a temporary worsening of the PhenoAge trend. Following the new year, the trend has begun to decline again.
*   **Testing Standardization:** Dave acknowledges the need for standardization in testing protocols, including fasting windows, hydration, and exercise timing prior to blood draws. He currently aims for about 16 ounces of water prior to testing and is working on a standardized pre-test diet.

## Key Biomarker Deep Dives

### Red Blood Cell Health

*   **Red Blood Cell Count (RBC):** RBCs have shown a decline with aging, but Dave has resisted this trend, showing positive news. While a decline is typical, excessively high RBC counts (above 16 g/dL for hemoglobin) can be associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Hemoglobin:** Similar to RBCs, hemoglobin has shown an age-related decline. Dave's trend is moving in the right direction, resisting this decline. However, his most recent tests show levels above 16 g/dL, warranting attention.
*   **Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV):** MCV typically increases with aging. Dave's data shows a "roller coaster" effect, but the trend line indicates an increase. While higher MCV values are common in centenarians, younger individuals typically have lower MCV.

### Kidney Function

*   **Creatinine:** Creatinine levels have decreased over time, which is generally positive. However, this decrease may be influenced by reduced creatine supplementation due to travel.
*   **Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN):** BUN has been increasing. If protein intake is constant, this could indicate declining kidney function. However, the concurrent decrease in uric acid suggests this may not be the case.
*   **Uric Acid:** Uric acid levels are decreasing, which is good news and suggests favorable kidney function.
*   **Cystatin C:** This marker is being tracked more frequently due to its strong correlation with GrimAge and its lower sensitivity to changes in muscle mass compared to creatinine.

### Liver Health

*   **Albumin:** Albumin levels are trending in the right direction and are close to optimal, indicating good liver health. Albumin is considered a highly concentrated protein in the blood and an important indicator of liver function.
*   **Bilirubin:** Dave's bilirubin levels have been decreasing and are within or approaching his optimal range. Previously high levels suggested oxidative stress.
*   **AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase):** While trending in the right direction, AST levels are still relatively high, often in the high thirties.
*   **ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase):** ALT values are moving in the right direction, in the high teens to low twenties, which is associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk.
*   **GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase):** GGT levels are excellent, well below the threshold associated with increased liver disease mortality risk.
*   **ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase):** ALP levels have shown variability, with recent trends moving upwards. While not definitively linked to aging, levels above 48 are associated with higher all-cause mortality risk. Dave's historically low ALP levels are notable.

### Immune System Markers

*   **Neutrophils:** Neutrophil counts are stable and trending at the lower end of the optimal range, which is favorable as they increase with aging.
*   **Lymphocytes:** Lymphocyte levels are declining, which is typical with aging. The goal is to resist this decline and aim for levels closer to 2,000 cells/µL, associated with the lowest risk of death.
*   **Monocytes:** Monocyte levels have remained stable and good, resisting the age-related increase.
*   **Platelets:** Platelet counts are stable and within an optimal range. They are neither declining with age nor excessively high, which is favorable.
*   **HS-CRP (High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein):** HS-CRP levels are low and trending downwards, indicating reduced inflammation.
*   **TNF Alpha (Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha):** With only two data points, TNF Alpha shows an increasing trend. As tumors secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF Alpha, it's a marker to monitor, especially in conjunction with other inflammatory markers.

### Metabolic and Cardiovascular Markers

*   **Glucose:** Glucose levels have remained relatively flat and are higher than desired.
*   **HbA1c (Glycated Hemoglobin):** HbA1c is trending upwards, which is concerning given Dave's avoidance of sugar. This suggests a need to investigate other factors impacting blood sugar control. A prescription for acarbose is being considered.
*   **Apolipoprotein B (APOB):** APOB levels are trending around 87, which is higher than the optimal range of less than 76 mg/dL associated with the lowest risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. Further reduction is a target.
*   **LDL Cholesterol:** While APOB is slightly elevated, LDL levels are within a range that is subject to ongoing research and debate regarding optimal targets, especially considering Dave's history of minor plaque buildup.
*   **HDL Cholesterol:** HDL levels have improved, moving from the high forties to the high fifties, resisting the age-related decline.
*   **Triglycerides:** Triglyceride levels are low and trending upwards only mildly, which is favorable.
*   **Lipoprotein(a):** Lipoprotein(a) levels have shown significant variability, unlike the typical consistency seen in most individuals. Further investigation into its impact and potential reduction strategies is ongoing.

### Hormonal Health

*   **Total Testosterone:** Total testosterone levels have remained stable or slightly increased, resisting the age-related decline. This is notable as it has occurred without a significant decrease in BMI, suggesting positive lifestyle interventions.
*   **Free Testosterone:** Free testosterone levels have been low, likely due to high Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG). The implications of this are complex, with some research suggesting potential benefits of lower free testosterone related to cancer risk reduction via calorie restriction.
*   **SHBG (Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin):** SHBG levels are elevated. While exercise can increase SHBG, the age-related increase and its association with Alzheimer's incidence and metabolic syndrome present a complex picture.
*   **DHT (Dihydrotestosterone):** DHT levels are trending towards Dave's optimal range, which he aims for to maintain hair thickness.
*   **Estradiol and Total Estrogens:** These levels have been elevated, likely due to supplementation with pregnenolone and DHEA. Strategies involving calcium D-glucarate and DIM are used to manage these levels.
*   **PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen):** PSA levels are on the rise, and the trend indicates a doubling over the past five years. This trend needs to be reversed urgently.
*   **Free PSA Percentage:** The percentage of free PSA is declining, which is a concern as lower percentages are associated with increased prostate cancer risk.

## Emerging and Investigational Biomarkers

*   **GrimAge:** This DNA methylation-based epigenetic clock is considered the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality risk. Dave is investigating the possibility of identifying specific methylation sites within GrimAge that correlate with his biomarker levels to guide targeted interventions.
*   **iolo Data:** Dave is analyzing raw iolo data, focusing on specific metabolites like lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), which are markers of mitochondrial function. Higher LPC levels are associated with better mitochondrial function, but there's a caveat that excessively high levels may not be optimal.
*   **GlycanAge:** This marker reflects protein glycosylation. Dave's score is unusually high, and he is investigating if his supplementation with glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine contributes to this score, rather than indicating inflammation.
*   **Thyroid Hormones (Free T3 and Free T4):** Ongoing optimization of thyroid hormone replacement therapy involves adjusting dosages and timing of medication to align with natural circadian rhythms. The free T3 to free T4 ratio is also being monitored.
*   **Nutritional and Supplement Impact:** Dave highlights the challenge of identifying specific interventions that move biomarkers due to the complexity of his supplement regimen and diet. He notes that changes, such as increased consumption of real greens, have impacted iron levels and potentially HDL. He also mentions the potential impact of consuming too much green tea on nutrient absorption.
