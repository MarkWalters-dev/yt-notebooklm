# 2024-02-11 Biomarkers Of Kidney Function - Creatinine Cystatin C What s Optimal

## Executive Summary

*   Kidney function, measured by estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), and serum creatinine levels both show age-related changes, with eGFR declining and creatinine increasing with age.
*   Creatinine's effectiveness as a kidney function biomarker is limited by its wide variability after age 40 and its direct correlation with muscle mass, which complicates interpretation as muscle mass declines with aging.
*   Cystatin C levels consistently increase with age, even in individuals without clinical risk factors, and higher levels are strongly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   Cystatin C is identified as a more robust predictor of all-cause mortality risk compared to metabolic markers like glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in certain populations.
*   Conversely, higher creatinine levels, likely reflecting greater muscle mass, are associated with a *reduced* all-cause mortality risk, suggesting a potential protective role of muscle mass.

## Kidney Function and Aging

Kidney function, estimated by eGFR, declines significantly with age, observed from 18 to 95 years old in both men and women. Inherent in eGFR measurement is creatinine. Serum creatinine levels also increase with age, specifically between 18 and 90 years old, indicating a decline in kidney function over time.

## Limitations of Creatinine as a Biomarker

Creatinine may not be the optimal estimator of kidney function in individuals older than 40 years due to several factors:

*   **Wide Variability:** Creatinine levels show wide variability in individuals older than 40 years, with some values reaching 14 mg/dL, a variability not observed in younger individuals.
*   **Proportionality to Muscle Mass:** Circulating creatinine levels are significantly correlated with muscle mass: higher muscle mass corresponds to higher creatinine, and lower muscle mass to lower creatinine.
*   **Conflicting Age-Related Trends:** Muscle mass declines during aging, which would theoretically lead to lower creatinine levels. However, aging is also associated with reduced kidney function, which leads to higher creatinine levels. This creates opposing factors, making creatinine a potentially confounding biomarker for kidney function in older populations.

## Cystatin C as an Alternative Biomarker

Given the limitations of creatinine, studies suggest that cystatin C may be a better biomarker of kidney function.

*   **Age-Related Increase:** Circulating levels of cystatin C show an age-related increase, even in individuals without clinical risk factors, from approximately 30 to 100 years old. In youth, cystatin C values are typically close to 0.7 mg/L.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** Studies show that individuals with initial cystatin C levels of 0.7 mg/L exhibit high survival rates (nearly all alive) after 16-17 years. Conversely, those with cystatin C levels greater than 1.08 mg/L experience a significantly reduced survival probability, with approximately 50% mortality after 17-18 years. This indicates that relatively higher cystatin C is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.

## Cystatin C as a Predictor of Mortality and Biological Age

Cystatin C is also identified as a top predictor of biological age and all-cause mortality.

A study evaluating demographics and biomarkers against all-cause mortality risk highlighted the following associations (higher levels of the biomarker associated with increased risk in red, decreased risk in blue):

*   **Top Predictors of Increased All-Cause Mortality Risk:**
    1.  **Chronological Age:** The strongest association with all-cause mortality risk.
    2.  **Being Male:** Men have an increased all-cause mortality risk relative to women.
    3.  **Cystatin C:** More strongly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk than metabolic health markers like glucose or HbA1c in this population.
    4.  **Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW):** A known predictor of biological age.
    5.  **Glucose & HbA1c:** Less strongly associated than Cystatin C.
*   **Top Predictor of Reduced All-Cause Mortality Risk:**
    1.  **Creatinine:** A reduced all-cause mortality risk is associated with higher creatinine levels. This may be explained by the significant correlation between higher muscle mass and higher creatinine, suggesting that higher muscle mass is associated with a lower risk of death from all causes.

## Personal Biomarker Data

For a test conducted on January 15, 2024, the circulating cystatin C level was measured at 0.72 mg/L. This value is considered relatively youthful and better than age-expected, indicating that kidney function is currently not a weakness.
