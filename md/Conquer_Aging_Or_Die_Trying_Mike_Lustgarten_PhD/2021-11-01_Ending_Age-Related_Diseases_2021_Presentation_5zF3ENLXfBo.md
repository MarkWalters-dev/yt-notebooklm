# 2021-11-01 Ending Age-Related Diseases 2021 Presentation

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age, measured by Levine's Phenotypic Age (9 biomarkers) and Aging.ai (19 biomarkers), strongly correlates with chronological age and is a robust predictor of all-cause and disease-specific mortality.
*   The presenter consistently demonstrates a biological age 12-19 years younger than chronological age over several years of personal monitoring.
*   Exceptional cardiovascular fitness, characterized by a low resting heart rate (47 bpm) and high heart rate variability (53-58 ms), is indicative of youth and good health, and is proposed as a significant contributor to the presenter's youthful biological age.
*   Dietary intake of CD38 inhibitors (e.g., apigenin, quercetin, luteolin, curaminin) correlates with lower glucose levels but does not significantly impact overall biological age as measured by Levine's Phenotypic Age or Aging.ai for the presenter, and also correlated with undesirable reductions in platelets and red blood cells.
*   Regular, comprehensive self-monitoring of blood biomarkers, dietary intake, and fitness metrics enables personalized health optimization strategies.

## Introduction to Biological Age Assessment

Aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades. Tracking well-established biomarkers of organ and systemic health can provide insight into whether aging and disease risk are being slowed.

The presenter's biological age was measured through blood tests using Morgan Levine's phenotypic age calculator, a widely recognized measure of biological age. The nine biomarkers included in this calculation are:
*   Albumin
*   Creatinine
*   Glucose
*   C-reactive protein
*   Percentage of lymphocytes
*   Mean red blood cell volume
*   Red blood cell distribution width
*   Alkaline phosphatase
*   White blood cells
*   Chronological age

For the presenter, with a chronological age of 48, the biological age calculated was 35.2 years, indicating a biological age 13.2 years younger than chronological age.

## Validation of Biological Age Calculators

### Levine's Phenotypic Age vs. Chronological Age

Levine's phenotypic age calculator shows a nearly perfect linear correlation with chronological age. In the NHANES III study cohort, the correlation coefficient was 0.94, and in a separate NHANES IV study, it was 0.96. These indicate very strong correlations between the biological age calculator and chronological age.

### Comparison with Epigenetic Clocks

The Horvath epigenetic clock, known for its strong correlation with biological age, also shows a robust correlation of 0.94 between epigenetic age and chronological age. This correlation is a composite measure across 16 different cell types including breast, cheek, cerebellum, colon, blood, and skin cells.

Considering Levine's phenotypic age calculator's correlations with chronological age (0.94-0.96) and the best-performing Horvath epigenetic clock (0.94), both methods demonstrate a similar ability to predict chronological age.

## Biological Age and Mortality Risk

Predicting chronological age is interesting, but the association of biological age with disease risk and all-cause mortality risk is crucial.

### All-Cause Mortality Risk

For every one-year increase in biological age, as calculated by Levine's phenotypic age, there is a **9% increase in all-cause mortality risk**. This association holds true across young, middle-aged, and older adults. Older biological ages, based on Levine's test, are significantly linked to increased all-cause mortality risk.

### Disease-Specific Mortality Risk

An older biological age is also associated with increased mortality risk for specific diseases:
*   Heart disease
*   Cancer
*   Chronic lower respiratory disease
*   Diabetes
*   Influenza or pneumonia
*   Kidney-related issues (nephritis and nephrosis)

Notably, it was not significantly associated with cerebrovascular disease or stroke. Furthermore, a paper by Morgan Levine's group showed that an older biological age, assessed up to thirteen years before the pandemic, was associated with an increased mortality risk in COVID-19 patients.

## Alternative Biological Age Calculator: Aging.ai

Levine's test is not the only blood-based biomarker panel available. Aging.ai 3.0 uses 19 different blood-based variables, obtainable from a standard chemistry panel and complete blood count (CBC). This test is relatively inexpensive ($35 USD in the US). For comparison, Levine's test, which uses 8 components from a standard chemistry panel/CBC plus high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, can cost up to $80 USD.

Aging.ai's correlation with chronological age is 0.8, which is strong, though not as high as Levine's test.

### Aging.ai and All-Cause Mortality Risk

Studies by the Aging.ai group have demonstrated a clear association with all-cause mortality risk:
*   In a Canadian cohort, individuals with a biological age five years older than their chronological age had approximately a **two-fold increased all-cause mortality risk**.
*   Conversely, individuals with a biological age more than five years younger than their chronological age experienced about a **50% decrease in all-cause mortality risk**.
*   These findings were replicated in a US-based (NHANES) cohort.

## Personal Longitudinal Data

The presenter's personal data shows consistent results:
*   **Aging.ai (single test):** A predictive biological age of 29 years, while chronologically nearly 49, representing a 20-year difference.
*   **Levine's Phenotypic Age (average of 12 tests since 2018):** Consistently averaged about 12 years younger than chronological age over a three-year period.
*   **Aging.ai (average of 27 tests since 2009):**
    *   From 2009 to 2013, the average difference between chronological and biological age was around 7 years.
    *   Since 2015, after initiating detailed dietary tracking and health optimization efforts, the average difference increased to 15 years younger.
    *   In three blood tests in 2021, the difference further increased to almost 19 years younger, indicating progress towards biochemical youthfulness.

### Dietary Tracking Methodology

The presenter's approach to dietary tracking for health optimization began in 2015 and has evolved:
*   **2015:** Started tracking macronutrients and micronutrients.
*   **July 2018 onwards:** Began quantifying actual food amounts consumed.
*   **Daily Protocol:**
    *   Weigh all food consumed.
    *   Enter food data into an online tracking tool.
    *   Log macronutrient and micronutrient data into an Excel file.
    *   Analyze correlations between dietary intake and blood biomarkers.
    *   Continuously optimize diet based on blood biomarker results.

This methodology provides sufficient dietary data corresponding to blood tests, allowing for correlational analysis between diet and biomarkers.

## Contributing Factors to Low Biological Age

### Supplements

*   **Levothyroxine:** Taken for over 20 years due to a hypothyroidism diagnosis in the presenter's twenties.
*   **Methyl B12:** Supplemented between April and July blood tests to reduce homocysteine levels.

### Cardiovascular Fitness

The presenter's average body weight was 156.7 pounds, with a BMI of 24.5 (within the normal range). More notably, the cardiovascular metrics indicate exceptional fitness:
*   **Resting Heart Rate (RHR):** 47 beats per minute (bpm).
*   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** Approximately 53 milliseconds (ms) at the time of the blood tests, increasing to 58 ms more recently.

**Resting Heart Rate (RHR) Trends:**
Data from fitness trackers (e.g., WHOOP, Fitbit), comparing fitness-minded individuals, shows that average resting heart rate generally increases with age from 20 to about 50 years old, then decreases during later aging.
A meta-analysis of 46 studies (over 1.2 million subjects) showed that the lowest all-cause mortality risk was associated with an RHR of 45 bpm. Risk increased as RHR went above 45 bpm. The presenter's RHR of 47 bpm suggests a relatively youthful resting heart rate, aligning with health and lower mortality risk based on population data.

**Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Trends:**
Heart rate variability is defined as the variation in time between successive heartbeats. For example, a heart rate of 60 bpm doesn't mean exactly one beat per second, but rather an average with micro-variations (e.g., 0.9s, 1.0s, 1.1s). Higher HRV is generally indicative of better cardiovascular health and youth.
WHOOP data reveals that heart rate variability decreases significantly during aging, particularly from 20 up to 65 years old. The presenter's average HRV of 53 ms (or 58 ms more recently) places them at the top of the range for their chronological age category, or at the low end of the range for a 20-year-old.

**Conclusion on Cardiovascular Fitness:**
A low resting heart rate in conjunction with a high heart rate variability is indicative of youth and robust cardiovascular health. In contrast, a low resting heart rate combined with a low heart rate variability is often found in older adults and can indicate poor cardiovascular fitness. The presenter's data (low RHR, high HRV) suggests that cardiovascular fitness is a significant contributor to their relatively young biological age.

### Diet and NAD/CD38 Pathway

NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) is critical for the health and function of nearly every organ system, but its levels decline during aging. A primary reason for this decline is the age-related increase in the CD38 protein, which degrades NAD.

**Biological Process of NAD Decline and Inhibition:**
Aging -> Increased CD38 protein -> Degradation of NAD -> NAD Decline
Dietary CD38 Inhibitors (Apigenin, Quercetin, Luteolin, Curaminin) -> Inhibit CD38 -> Increase NAD -> Slow Age-Related NAD Decline

These CD38 inhibitors are found in food. The presenter's dietary intake of these inhibitors ranges from 160 to 390 milligrams per day. Approximately 70% of this intake comes from curaminin, largely due to a high consumption of blackberries, which are rich in this compound.

**Correlations with Biological Age and Biomarkers:**
The sum of dietary CD38 inhibitor intake was analyzed for correlations with biological age and its component biomarkers across 11 to 16 blood tests.

*   **Levine's Phenotypic Age:**
    *   No statistically significant correlation with overall phenotypic age.
    *   **Significant inverse correlation with glucose levels:** Higher intake of CD38 inhibitors correlated with lower glucose levels. However, this single correlation was not strong enough to significantly reduce the overall biological age score.

*   **Aging.ai Age:**
    *   An inverse correlation was observed (higher intake -> younger Aging.ai age), but it was **not statistically significant**.
    *   The same inverse correlation with glucose levels was observed.
    *   **However, higher CD38 inhibitor intake also correlated with lower levels of platelets and red blood cells.** This is potentially undesirable, as both platelets and red blood cells naturally decline during aging, suggesting these biomarkers were being pushed in the "wrong" direction.

Considering these results, the dietary intake of CD38 inhibitors does not appear to be a major factor impacting the presenter's overall reduction in biological age. While it beneficially impacts glucose, its effect on other biomarkers (platelets, red blood cells) and overall biological age is either negligible or mixed.
