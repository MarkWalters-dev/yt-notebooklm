# 2024-12-05 Sunlight Cortisol Darkness And Melatonin - Roger Seheult M.D.

## Executive Summary
* Morning sunlight exposure is crucial for triggering the necessary pulse of cortisol, which primes the body for the day, akin to the effect of caffeine.
* The necessary evening decline in light exposure (avoiding artificial light) after approximately 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM allows the pineal gland to initiate the peak release of melatonin.
* Proper hormonal rhythm requires both bright morning light signaling (for cortisol) and subsequent darkness/lack of light in the evening (for melatonin).
* Delayed or absent morning sunlight leads to a delayed and less effective cortisol pulse, resulting in suboptimal morning energy levels.

## Hormonal Timing and Light Exposure

Cortisol is characterized as the "hormone of the day," peaking at the beginning of the day, whereas melatonin is the "hormone of the beginning of the night." Both hormones function best when released in distinct pulses.

### Cortisol Regulation by Morning Sunlight

Morning sunlight exposure is essential for initiating the proper daily cortisol rhythm:
1. **Action:** Bright, shining light entering the eyes in the morning triggers the body to release the appropriate pulse of cortisol.
2. **Effect:** This cortisol pulse prepares the body for activity and provides immediate energy, often described as having the energetic effect of a cup of coffee.
3. **Consequence of Deficiency:** If morning sunlight is not received, the cortisol pulse necessary to start the day will be delayed, and its full energizing effects will not be realized.

### Melatonin Regulation by Evening Darkness

The evening rhythm relies on the *absence* of light to permit melatonin secretion from the pineal gland:
1. **Mechanism:** Artificial light exposure, particularly late in the evening, inhibits the production of melatonin.
2. **Protocol:** Avoiding light around 9:00 PM, 10:00 PM, and 11:00 PM allows the pineal gland to initiate its necessary peak of melatonin release.
3. **Requirement:** The system requires both the morning light signal (for cortisol) and the evening lack of light signal (for melatonin) to maintain proper circadian function.
