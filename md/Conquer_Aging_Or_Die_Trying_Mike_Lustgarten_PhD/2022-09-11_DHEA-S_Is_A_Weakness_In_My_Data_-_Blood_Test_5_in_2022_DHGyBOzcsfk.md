# 2022-09-11 DHEA-S Is A Weakness In My Data - Blood Test 5 in 2022

## Executive Summary

*   A total cholesterol of 133 mg/dL is associated with more than a twofold increased all-cause mortality risk compared to a reference range of 220-229 mg/dL.
*   Low total cholesterol is observed in both youth (around 160-170 mg/dL) and very old age (centenarians), indicating it can be associated with either vitality or frailty.
*   In the context of youthful biomarkers (higher albumin, higher HDL), low total cholesterol (below 160 mg/dL) is associated with a decreased risk of all-cause mortality.
*   The "aged phenotype" is characterized by low total cholesterol (<160 mg/dL), low albumin (<38 mg/dL), and low HDL cholesterol (<47 mg/dL), and is associated with higher all-cause mortality risk.
*   A small study (393 participants) suggests that low total cholesterol with higher albumin may indicate a "youthful phenotype" with decreased mortality risk, but further studies are needed.

## Analysis of Total Cholesterol and Mortality Risk

Data from a large study (over 3.3 million subjects aged 44-55) shows a U-shaped relationship between total cholesterol and all-cause mortality.

*   **Reference Range:** Total cholesterol of 220-229 mg/dL has a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.
*   **Your Data:** A total cholesterol of 133 mg/dL is associated with an HR of >2, indicating more than a twofold increased risk of all-cause mortality.

### Total Cholesterol Across Age Groups

*   **Youth (18-25 years):** Total cholesterol is generally found in the range of 160-170 mg/dL, varying slightly between males and females.
*   **Mid-life (around age 50):** Total cholesterol typically peaks.
*   **Advanced Age (around 100 years):** Total cholesterol may decline again, with centenarians often exhibiting relatively low total cholesterol levels.

## Interpreting Low Total Cholesterol

The significance of low total cholesterol depends on accompanying biomarkers:

*   **Context of Youthful Biomarkers:**
    *   Total Cholesterol < 160 mg/dL
    *   Albumin (ALB) and HDL Cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are relatively high.
    *   **Finding:** This combination is associated with a **decreased** all-cause mortality risk. This is considered a "close to youthful phenotype."
*   **Context of Aged Biomarkers:**
    *   Total Cholesterol < 160 mg/dL
    *   Albumin < 38 mg/dL
    *   HDL-C < 47 mg/dL
    *   **Finding:** This combination is associated with **higher** all-cause mortality risk and is termed the "aged phenotype."

### Significance of Statistical Measures

*   **Hazard Ratio (HR) < 1:** Indicates a statistically significant decreased risk.
*   **Hazard Ratio (HR) > 1:** Indicates a statistically significant increased risk.
*   **95% Confidence Interval (CI) Below 1:** Statistically significant decreased risk.
*   **95% CI Overlapping 1:** Not statistically significant.

## Caveats of a Small Study

A study with 393 participants indicated that when low total cholesterol is accompanied by higher albumin, the mortality risk is not significantly increased. However, this study is small, and further research is needed to confirm these findings. The study was published in 2001 and did not adjust for factors like albumin levels in its primary analysis, unlike the larger study discussed.

## DHEA-S as a Potential Weakness

The analysis indicates that DHEA-S may represent a weakness or an area requiring further investigation within the current blood test data.
