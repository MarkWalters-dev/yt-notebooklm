# 2022-09-18 Blood Test 5 in 2022 - Supplements Diet

## Executive Summary

*   **B12 Paradox in Homocysteine Management:** While higher B12 intake strongly correlated with lower homocysteine levels, it also showed significant negative correlations with numerous other biomarkers, including higher glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), neutrophils, monocytes, LDL, platelets, and red blood cells. This led to a dietary strategy to obtain B12 below the average intake, primarily from sardines, rather than high-dose supplements, which failed to adequately lower homocysteine.
*   **Fructose Impact on Biomarkers:** An increase in total dietary fructose, resulting from a shift to higher-fructose berries (blackberries and blueberries), necessitated a reduction in date intake. High fructose intake is significantly correlated with more blood biomarkers trending negatively.
*   **Individualized Nutrient Optimization Beyond RDAs:** The individual's data indicates that optimal nutrient intake relative to Recommended Daily Allowances (RDAs) or Adequate Intakes (AIs) is highly specific. For example, current Vitamin K intake is 16 times its AI with positive overall correlations, and Copper intake is 5 times its RDA with positive correlations. In contrast, high B12 intake, significantly above RDA, demonstrated a negative net correlative score.
*   **Correlation-Guided Dietary Adjustments:** A systematic approach uses net correlative scores for dietary components (macros, micros, and individual foods) against a broad panel of blood biomarkers to guide dietary modifications. A positive score suggests increasing intake above average, a negative score suggests decreasing below average, and a zero score suggests maintaining average intake.
*   **Targeted Macronutrient Intake:** Following these correlation rules, the individual maintained specific average daily intakes: ~2294 calories, 97.4g protein (17% of total calories), 83g total fat (33%), and 238g total carbohydrates (51%).

## Supplements

*   **Levothyroxine:** 137.5 micrograms/day (for hypothyroidism, taken since mid-twenties).
*   **Melatonin:** Very sporadically, only 3 of 42 days, averaging less than 11 micrograms/day.
*   **Vitamin D:** No supplementation during summer. Instead, received regular full-body sun exposure for 30-35 minutes per session, at least 2-3 days per week (or more). Previous sessions longer than an hour led to sun damage.
*   No other supplements or geroprotectors were taken.

## Diet Methodology

The dietary analysis for Blood Test 5 in 2022 covers a 42-day period, from July 11 (day of previous blood test) to August 21 (day before current blood test).

**Protocol for Diet Tracking:**

1.  Weighed all food daily since April 2015 using a food scale.
2.  Entered daily food amounts into Cronometer.
3.  Transferred daily Cronometer data into an Excel spreadsheet.
4.  Calculated average daily intake for the 42-day period, including individual food amounts, macronutrients, and micronutrients.

This methodology allows for calculating correlations between dietary intake and blood biomarkers, enabling targeted dietary adjustments for biomarker optimization. Each blood test since 2015 has a corresponding diet composition.

## Diet Composition

The primary goal for this blood test was to maintain the improved biomarker data observed in Test 4 and overall 2022 results, compared to the previous two years and 12 blood tests. This meant keeping the diet mostly consistent while making small, optimizing tweaks.

**Individual Food Intake (Average daily intake for 42-day period, ranked highest to lowest):**

*   **Most abundant:** Carrot, strawberries, mushrooms, red bell pepper, beets, collard greens, watermelon.
*   **Least abundant (on this plot):** Walnuts (21 grams/day).

**Dietary Adjustments:**

*   **Unintentional Changes:**
    *   Strawberry intake decreased by approximately half (from 622g to ~311g) due to product unavailability.
    *   Switched to a three-berry mix, significantly increasing intake of blackberries and blueberries (which were absent in the previous test).
*   **Intentional Changes:**
    *   **Sardines:** Increased intake from an average of 99g/day (Test 4) to 114g/day (Test 5).
        *   **Rationale:** Sardines are the primary source of B12, contributing 11.4 micrograms/day out of a total B12 intake of 12.2 micrograms/day (RDA is 2.4 micrograms). This increase aimed to reduce homocysteine levels based on prior correlations.
    *   **Dates:** Reduced intake from 25g/day (Test 4) to approximately 12.5g/day (Test 5).
        *   **Rationale:** Blueberries and blackberries contain higher fructose levels than strawberries, increasing overall fructose intake. Since high fructose intake correlates negatively with many biomarkers, date intake (also high in fructose) was reduced to mitigate this.

**"Cheat Meals":**
The diet is not always "clean"; a "cheat day" or two typically occurs immediately after a blood test. For this period, 147g of Nutella (mixed with peanut butter) and 60g of Swedish fish were consumed on the day of and day after the blood test, with no further intake for the subsequent 40 days. Gum is also consumed during daily 75-85 minute workouts.

## Key Biomarker Insights

### Homocysteine and B12 Correlation

Homocysteine is an important biomarker associated with organ system health and aging.

**Impact of High Homocysteine:**

Elevated homocysteine (greater than 15 micromolar) is linked to adverse health and/or function in multiple organ systems:

Cardiovascular -> Brain -> Eyes and Ears -> Reproductive apparatus (women) -> Pancreas -> Bone -> Kidney

**Homocysteine Levels Across the Lifespan:**

*   **Youth (12-year-olds):** Around 6-7 micromolar.
*   **Elderly (80-year-olds):** Around 11-12 micromolar.
*   **Centenarians (median age 100):** 23.1 micromolar.
Homocysteine levels significantly increase with aging.

**B12 and Homocysteine Correlation:**

Analysis of 20 blood tests (2017-2022) revealed a significant inverse correlation: higher B12 intake correlated with lower blood homocysteine levels (correlation coefficient: -0.65, p < 0.05).

*   **With Methyl B12 supplementation:** Average homocysteine levels were 9.4 micromolar.
*   **Without supplementation:** Average homocysteine levels were 11.9 micromolar.

**The B12 Dilemma (Correlation with Big Picture Biomarkers):**

Despite the positive correlation with lower homocysteine, a relatively higher B12 intake shows significant correlations with more blood biomarkers trending negatively. Analysis of 21 blood test measurements shows:

*   **Beneficial Correlation (Green Arrow):**
    *   Lower Homocysteine
*   **Adverse Correlations (Red Arrows):**
    *   Higher Glucose
    *   Higher Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)
    *   Higher Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)
    *   Higher Neutrophils
    *   Higher Monocytes
    *   Lower Lymphocyte Percentage
    *   Higher LDL (potentially too high, even if within reference range for individual data)
    *   Higher Platelets (potentially too high, even if within reference range for individual data, reverses age-related decline)
    *   Higher Red Blood Cells (potentially too high, even if within reference range for individual data, reverses age-related decline)

The **Net Correlative Score for B12 is -8**. According to the established rules (negative score suggests eating below average intake), this indicates that overall, a higher B12 intake leads to more adverse biomarker trends. The individual's average B12 intake since 2015 was 542 micrograms/day. Current intake (12.2 micrograms/day from food) is significantly below this average.

The attempt to increase B12 through sardines for improved bioavailability did not effectively reduce homocysteine in this blood test, indicating a need for a different strategy to lower homocysteine. Previous attempts with TMG (trimethylglycine), folate, and B6 were also unsuccessful.

### Dates and Homocysteine Correlation

Analysis of 13 data points (since 2018) shows a strong inverse correlation between date intake and homocysteine levels (correlation coefficient: -0.85). Higher date intake correlated with lower homocysteine. However, dates have a **Net Correlative Score of -4**, suggesting they should be consumed below the average intake of 29g/day. The individual's current intake is approximately 12.5g/day. The hypothesis is that the observed inverse correlation with homocysteine might be confounded by past B12 supplementation; this will be investigated by observing homocysteine levels in the next blood test without B12 supplementation.

## Macronutrient Intake and Correlations

Dietary choices for macronutrients are guided by their net correlative scores with big-picture blood biomarkers. A positive score means eating above average intake, a zero score means eating at average, and a negative score means eating below average.

    *   Average intake: ~300 IU/day (below RDA of 600 IU).
    *   Circulating 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels (average of 10 at-home tests during this period): ~64 ng/mL (well above the deficiency threshold of <30 ng/mL).
*   **Vitamin K:**
    *   Average intake: ~2000 micrograms/day.
    *   Net Correlative Score: +2.
    *   Action: Eat above average (average: >1500 micrograms/day). **(Following)**
    *   AI (Adequate Intake): 120 micrograms/day (current intake is ~16 times higher, but without significant negative correlations).

### Minerals

*   **Copper:**
    *   Average intake: 4.7mg/day (from mushrooms, cocoa beans).
    *   Net Correlative Score: +3.
    *   Action: Eat above average (average since 2015: 4.3mg/day). **(Following)**
    *   RDA: 0.9mg/day (current intake is >5 times higher, with positive correlations).
*   **Magnesium:**
    *   Average intake: 696mg/day.
    *   Net Correlative Score: 0.
    *   Action: Eat at average (average: 802mg/day). **(Not strictly following)**
    *   RDA: 420mg/day (current intake is above RDA). (Rationale: For scores around zero or +/-1, a slight deviation from the exact average might not yield a significant difference in biomarker outcomes).

**General Note on RDA/AI:**
The data suggests that there are no universal "rules" for how high one should go above the RDA or AI for all nutrients. Optimal intake appears to be highly specific to each nutrient and potentially individualized, balancing positive and negative correlations across a wide array of biomarkers.
