**Executive Summary:**
*   Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify genetic loci associated with lifespan in mice.
*   A strong association signal for lifespan was detected on mouse chromosome 18.
*   Lifespan variability in mice is explained by diet (7%), body weight (1%), the chromosome 18 locus (4.5%), and overall genetic background (20%).
*   The chromosome 18 locus is also associated with Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW), suggesting a potential causal link between this locus, RDW, and lifespan.

## Mouse Lifespan Genetics

To understand the genetic underpinnings of lifespan, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can be performed by genotyping mice and mapping loci associated with lifespan. A mouse genome includes 19 autosomes, XY chromosomes, and mitochondrial DNA. The strength of association of a particular genomic point with lifespan is indicated by the magnitude of its signal. A strong association signal was observed on chromosome 18.

## Variance in Lifespan

Lifespan is a noisy trait with significant variability, even among populations under controlled conditions. The contribution of different factors to this variability has been calculated:

*   **Diet:** Explains about 7% of lifespan variance.
*   **Body Weight:** Explains about 1% of lifespan variance.
*   **Chromosome 18 Locus:** Explains 4.5% of lifespan variance independently.
*   **Other Genetic Background:** The combined effect of other genetic loci explains approximately 20% of the variance.

For a DO mouse living in these conditions, genetics significantly outweighs the effect of diet in explaining lifespan variability.

## Chromosome 18 Locus

The quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 18 is not only associated with lifespan but also with Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW). A working hypothesis suggests that this locus on chromosome 18 affects a factor closely related to RDW, which in turn influences lifespan. This causal hypothesis is being investigated through ongoing studies.
