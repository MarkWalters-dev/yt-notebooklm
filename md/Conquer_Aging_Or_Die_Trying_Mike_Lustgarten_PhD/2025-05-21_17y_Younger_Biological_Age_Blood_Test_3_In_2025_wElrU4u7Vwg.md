# 2025-05-21 17y Younger Biological Age Blood Test 3 In 2025

## Executive Summary

*   The current blood test, using the PhenoAge calculator, indicates a biological age of 34.8 years, which is 17.4 years younger than the chronological age.
*   Increased testing frequency (up to 8 times per year) is proposed as a more accurate method for assessing the rate of aging compared to less frequent testing.
*   Over the past eight years, the individual has resisted the expected age-related increase in PhenoAge, suggesting progress in managing biomarker health.
*   The observed younger biological age is attributed to making biomarker progress, with a specific mention of reducing RDW over the past eight years.

## Biological Age Calculation and Methodology

### Current Test Results

*   **Date of Test:** 2025-05-21
*   **Biological Age Calculator:** PhenoAge (Dr. Morgan Levine's)
*   **Chronological Age:** Not explicitly stated, but inferred to be older than 34.8 years.
*   **Calculated Biological Age:** 34.8 years
*   **Difference from Chronological Age:** 17.4 years younger

### Rationale for Frequent Testing

*   **Problem:** Single or infrequent blood tests (e.g., one per year) over a short span may not accurately represent the true rate of aging due to the varying dynamics of biomarker changes.
*   **Proposed Solution:** Testing more frequently (e.g., up to 8 times per year) and averaging results for a given year provides a more robust measure of the aging rate.
*   **Tracking:** Year-to-year changes in the averaged biological age are considered the best approach for studying the rate of aging.

## Historical Biological Age Trends (Since 2018)

The following data represents the average biological age per year, based on an increasing number of tests per year.

*   **2018 (First year including HSCRP for PhenoAge):**
    *   Number of Tests: 3 (over a 2-year span)
    *   Average Biological Age: 34.3 years
*   **2020 & 2021:**
    *   Number of Tests per Year: 6
    *   Total Tests (2020-2021): 12
    *   Average Biological Age per Year: 33.9 years
*   **2022:**
    *   Number of Tests: 7
    *   Average Biological Age: 32.1 years (best data yet)
*   **2023:**
    *   Number of Tests: 7
    *   Average Biological Age: 32.9 years (moving in the wrong direction)
*   **2024:**
    *   Number of Tests: 8
    *   Average Biological Age: 33.1 years
*   **2025 (To date, after 3 tests):**
    *   Current Average Biological Age: 31.9 years (best ever so far)
    *   *Note:* This average includes a recent test result of 34.8 years, which was not as good as the first two tests in 2025.

## Expected vs. Observed PhenoAge Progression

*   **Expected Increase:** PhenoAge is expected to increase by 0.9 years for every 1 year of chronological age, even if biomarkers remain unchanged.
*   **Calculation (for 2025):** Starting from 2018, over 8 years, the expected PhenoAge should be closer to 41 years (0.9 years/year * 8 years + 2018 baseline).
*   **Observed Outcome:** The individual has resisted this expected age-related increase, indicating successful biomarker management.

## Biomarker Progress

*   **General:** The ability to resist age-related PhenoAge increase suggests positive biomarker progress.
*   **Specific Mention:** Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) has been successfully reduced over the past eight years.

## Future Content and Transparency

*   **Part 2 of the Series:** Will feature a full blood test report, including all data (good and bad).
*   **Transparency:** Full lab test reports will be shared, detailing plans to address poor results and maintain good ones.
*   **Underlying Factors:** The diet, supplements, and prescription medications contributing to the 17-year younger biological age will be discussed.
