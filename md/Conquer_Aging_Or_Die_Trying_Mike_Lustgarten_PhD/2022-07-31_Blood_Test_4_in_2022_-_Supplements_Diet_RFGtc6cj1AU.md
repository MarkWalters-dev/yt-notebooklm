# 2022-07-31 Blood Test 4 in 2022 - Supplements Diet

**Executive Summary:**
*   Biological age significantly outperformed chronological age (17-21 years younger by Levine's and aging.ai tests).
*   A personalized dietary strategy involves daily food tracking via weighing and Cronometer, correlating intake with up to 38 blood biomarker tests, and adjusting consumption based on individual correlative scores (positive correlation -> increased intake; negative correlation -> decreased intake).
*   Specific foods like strawberries, mushrooms, beets, collard greens, and watermelon showed positive correlations with beneficial aging biomarkers, leading to increased intake. Red bell pepper showed negative correlations, prompting reduced intake.
*   Macronutrient analysis revealed negative correlations for overall calories, protein, total fat, monounsaturated fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol, prompting reduced intake below average. Omega-3, omega-6, and net carbs showed positive correlations, prompting increased intake.
*   Micronutrient optimization extended beyond Recommended Daily Allowances (RDAs), with Niacin, Iron, and Vitamin K showing strong positive correlations at intakes significantly above RDA, while B12, Beta-carotene, Vitamin E, Calcium, and Sodium showed negative correlations, necessitating reduced intake below average levels.

## Supplements

*   **Levothyroxine:** 137.5 micrograms/day for ~25 years (diagnosed with hypothyroidism in mid-twenties).
*   **Vitamin D:** 1000 IU/day for 9 months/year. Intake was sporadic during the 63-day period corresponding to this blood test.
*   **Melatonin:** Occasional intake of ~39 micrograms/day to aid sleep.

No other supplements, including gel protectors or senolytics, were used.

## Diet Tracking Methodology

The blood test was conducted on July 11, 2022. Dietary intake data was collected for the 63-day period from May 9 (day of the previous blood test) to July 10 (day before this blood test).

*   **Daily Food Weighing:** Food has been weighed daily using a food scale since April 2015.
*   **Data Entry:** Daily food amounts are entered into Cronometer.
*   **Spreadsheet Integration:** Daily data from Cronometer is transferred to a spreadsheet.
*   **Correlation Analysis:** Average intake for the 63-day period is correlated with blood biomarkers. The individual has data from up to 38 blood tests since 2015, enabling correlation of macro/micronutrients with blood biomarkers. Individual food tracking began in 2018, providing data for up to 23 tests.

This approach allows for focusing on foods with positive correlative scores with biomarkers while minimizing intake of foods with negative scores.

## Individual Food Intake & Correlations

Average daily dietary intake for the 63-day period (Test #3 to Test #4):

**Dietary Strategy based on Net Correlative Score:**
*   **Positive Score:** Aim to eat above average intake.
*   **Zero Score:** Aim to eat close to or at average intake.
*   **Negative Score:** Aim to eat below average intake.

A relatively higher intake is considered beneficial if correlations with biomarkers indicate a reduced risk for aging and/or all-cause mortality (ACM). Conversely, relatively higher intake is considered detrimental if correlations indicate an increased risk.

**Big Picture Biomarkers used for Correlation:**
*   Glucose
*   Homocysteine
*   Three markers of kidney function
*   Three markers of liver function
*   All major lipoproteins
*   Immune-related cells and proteins (e.g., globulin)
*   Red blood cells and related measures
*   High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (inflammation marker)
*   Overall biological age scores (Levine's PhenoAge and aging.ai)

Correlation coefficient (r) and p-value (p < 0.005 for statistical significance) are used for analysis.

Examples of "junk" food included a small bag of M&M's, store-bought roasted/salted peanut butter (due to advanced glycation end-products), and chewing gum during workouts.

## Overall Dietary Approach & Optimization

This individualized approach aims to optimize nutrient intake (both macro and micro) beyond general Recommended Daily Allowances (RDAs) or Adequate Intakes (AIs). By continually assessing the correlation between dietary components and a comprehensive panel of blood biomarkers, the individual seeks to identify optimal intake levels for themselves (n=1) to achieve the best possible biomarker profile for healthy aging. The data indicates that there is no single "general rule" for how much a micronutrient should exceed or fall below the RDA; instead, each nutrient requires individual assessment based on its correlative score with aging biomarkers.
