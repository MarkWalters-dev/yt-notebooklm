# 2023-10-22 17 - 23 Younger Biological Age - Supplements Diet Blood Test 6 in 2023

## Executive Summary
*   Biological age assessments (PhenoAge and aging.ai) indicated the subject was significantly younger than their chronological age (17 and 23 years younger, respectively).
*   The diet, tracked meticulously over 49 days, featured a very low average daily calorie intake (2,115 kcal), high fiber (83g/day), and a calculated net macro split of approximately 43% Fat, 39% Net Carbs, and 18% Protein.
*   Specific dietary adjustments were made to influence the oral microbiome (increasing yogurt, red bell pepper, pistachio; reducing mushrooms, onions) to potentially decrease *Serratia marcescens*.
*   Vitamin K intake was intentionally high, averaging over 23 times the RDA, correlated with maintaining HDL above 50 for four consecutive tests.
*   Consistent efforts to lower homocysteine via B12, TMG, serine/B6 experiments were unsuccessful, prompting a new focus on increasing dietary choline via eggs.

## Biological Age Markers
*   **PhenoAge:** Indicated age was 17 years younger than chronological age.
*   **aging.ai:** Indicated age was 23 years younger than chronological age.

## Supplement Protocol (49-Day Period: August 21 – October 10, 2023)

*   **Levothyroxine:** ~140 mcg/day (for pre-existing hypothyroidism).
*   **Vitamin D:** 1,000 IU/day for 20 of the 49 days.
*   **Methyl B12:** 1,000 mcg/day for 46 of the 49 days (Attempting to reduce homocysteine after other interventions failed).
*   **Fish Oil (EPA + DHA):** 2.1 grams/day for 18 days (August 24 – September 10) to potentially impact NAD levels; this intervention was discontinued as it did not raise NAD.
*   **Nicotinic Acid (Niacin):** 60 mg/day (10x lower dose than previous attempt) for 13 days (September – October 4). Ended a few days prior to the test date to avoid influencing epigenetic aging pace results.

## Diet Protocol and Composition

The diet was tracked daily using Cronometer for 50 different foods over the 49-day period corresponding to Blood Test #6.

### Dietary Adjustments (vs. Test #5)
Changes were made to modulate the oral microbiome, targeting bacteria that may reduce *Serratia marcescens*.

*   **Increased Intake:** Red bell pepper, yogurt, pistachio (small increases only).
*   **Reduced Intake:** Mushrooms, onions (under the same premise regarding oral bacteria).
*   **Fat Compensation:** Almonds were reduced to accommodate the small increase in pistachios to maintain a total fat goal of ~80g/day.
*   **Homocysteine Focus:** Added two eggs per week (one on workout days) to increase dietary choline intake, as prior homocysteine reduction attempts (TMG, Serine + B6) failed. (Note: Folate intake is 2.5x RDA; B12 is supplemented; TMG up to 3g/day failed previously).

### Dietary Consistency and "Junk Food"
*   The diet composition (macros/micros) is consistently associated with youthful biomarker data, excluding Horvath's epigenetic age and homocysteine.
*   **Cheat Meals:** Limited to a maximum of two per 49-day testing period to prevent binge tendencies.
    *   For this period: Homemade peanut butter cups (chocolate chips + peanut butter) were consumed exclusively on two days.
    *   Calorie contribution: ~1,200 calories total for the cheat days, equating to 1.1% of the total calorie intake (99% clean diet).

### Top Calorie Contributors (By Calories)
Nine of the top ten foods by calorie contribution remained the same as tests 1-5. Coconut butter missed the top 10 list this time.

*   **Top Contributor:** Sardines.
*   **New Entry in Top 10:** Collard greens (increased to 97g/day from 85g/day in test #5). This increase was targeted due to correlation between Vitamin K (abundant in collards) and HDL levels.

### Macronutrient Breakdown (49-Day Average)

| Metric | Value | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Calories** | 2,115 kcal/day | Lowest average daily intake since tracking began in April 2015. |
| **Protein** | 95 g/day (18% of total calories) | Approx. 1.5 g/kg body weight. |
| **Total Fat** | 81 g/day (35% of total calories) | |
| **Total Carbohydrates** | 290 g/day | |
| **Fiber Intake** | 83 g/day | |
| **Net Carbohydrates** | 207 g/day (39% of net calories) | Calculated after subtracting fiber. |

**Net Macro Split Calculation:**
1.  **Fiber Contribution:** 176 calories (from soluble fiber fermentation into SCFA) added to fat contribution (~8.3% of total calories).
2.  **Adjusted Fat Percentage:** 35% (Dietary Fat) + 8.3% (Fiber Fat) = **43% Fat**
3.  **Final Net Macro Profile:** 43% Fat / 39% Net Carbs / 18% Protein.

### Fructose Intake
*   **Total Fructose:** ~58 grams/day (Fructose + Sucrose/2).
*   This intake is near the lowest recorded since 2015 (lowest was 57.5 g/day).

### Micronutrient Highlights
*   RDA coverage was achieved for all vitamins and minerals, with many purposely exceeding RDA based on biomarker correlations.
*   **Vitamin K Intake:** Over 2,300 micrograms/day, which is approximately 23 times the RDA (~100 mcg). This is correlated with maintaining HDL above 50 for four consecutive tests.
