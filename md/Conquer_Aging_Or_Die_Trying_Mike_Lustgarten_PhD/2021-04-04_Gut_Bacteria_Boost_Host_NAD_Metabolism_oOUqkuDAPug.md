# 2021-04-04 Gut Bacteria Boost Host NAD Metabolism

## Executive Summary

*   Gut bacteria significantly impact host NAD metabolism by utilizing the deamidated biosynthesis pathway.
*   CD38, an NAD-degrading protein, increases with age and significantly reduces NMN bioavailability by approximately 75%.
*   Gut bacteria possess the nicotinamide deamidase (PNCA) enzyme, which converts nicotinamide (NAM) into nicotinic acid (NA), a pathway not available in human cells.
*   This bacterial conversion of NAM to NA is crucial for boosting NAD levels, particularly in the colon, liver, and kidneys.
*   The gut bacterial deamidated pathway can contribute to a significant percentage (up to 60% in liver and kidneys) of systemic NAD levels, especially in the presence of nicotinamide.

## Background: NAD Metabolism and Aging

NAD levels decline during aging, primarily due to age-related increases in the NAD-degrading protein CD38. CD38 also degrades NMN, reducing its effectiveness as an NAD precursor. While nicotinamide (NAM) can be converted to NAD, its conversion to NMN is mediated by NAMPT, an enzyme whose levels also decline with age. This suggests that the amidated pathway for NAD synthesis may not be optimal for boosting NAD levels in aging individuals.

## The Role of Gut Bacteria in NAD Synthesis

Human cells lack the enzyme to convert nicotinamide (NAM) into nicotinic acid (NA). However, gut bacteria possess this capability through the deamidated biosynthesis pathway.

### Evidence for Bacterial NAM to NA Conversion

*   **Observation in Mice:** Mice force-fed nicotinamide showed significantly reduced levels of NAM in colonic luminal content, with a dramatic increase in nicotinic acid.
*   **Antibiotic Treatment:** Antibiotic treatment in mice, which reduced gut bacterial DNA by over 99%, abolished the conversion of NAM to nicotinic acid, confirming the role of gut bacteria. In these antibiotic-treated mice, NAM levels in the colon remained high, while nicotinic acid levels were virtually absent.

### Identification of the Key Enzyme

*   The **nicotinamide deamidase (PNCA)** enzyme, encoded by the **PNCA gene**, was identified as the bacterial protein responsible for converting NAM to NA.
*   **Germ-free mice colonization experiments** demonstrated that colonization with E. coli lacking the PNCA gene resulted in negligible NA levels and significantly reduced NAD levels in colonic and liver cells. Conversely, colonization with functional E. coli led to NA production and higher NAD levels.

### Bacterial Phyla Involved in PNCA Activity

The majority of bacteria containing the PNCA gene are:
1.  **Proteobacteria**
2.  Unclassified bacteria
3.  **Bacteroides**

## Impact of Gut Bacterial Pathway on Systemic NAD Levels

### High Dose Nicotinamide (80 mg/kg)

In mice administered a high dose of nicotinamide, the fraction of NAD derived from the gut bacteria-mediated pathway was observed as follows:
*   Small intestine: ~30%
*   Colon: 70%
*   Liver: 85%
*   Kidney: 59%

### Physiologically Relevant Dose of Nicotinamide (4 mg/kg)

A lower dose of nicotinamide, approximately equivalent to that found in a 200g steak, yielded similar results:
*   Small intestine: ~40%
*   Colon: 60%
*   Liver: 60%

**Conclusion:** In the presence of nicotinamide, the majority of tissue-derived NAD is formed by the gut bacterial deamidated pathway, with the exception of small intestinal cells, which consistently showed less than 50% contribution.

## Proposed Pathway and Systemic Effects

1.  Nicotinamide (NAM) reaching the colonic lumen is converted by gut bacteria into nicotinic acid (NA) via the deamidated pathway.
2.  NA enters colonic epithelial cells, increasing NAD levels within these cells.
3.  NAD from colonic cells can be absorbed into the bloodstream or further metabolized.
4.  This process can positively impact systemic NAD metabolism, increasing NAD levels in non-intestinal cells such as the liver and kidneys (up to 60% of NAD in these tissues can be derived from this pathway).
