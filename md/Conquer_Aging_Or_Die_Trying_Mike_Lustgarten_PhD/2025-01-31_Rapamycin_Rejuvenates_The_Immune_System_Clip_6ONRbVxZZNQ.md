# 2025-01-31 Rapamycin Rejuvenates The Immune System Clip

## Executive Summary

*   Rapamycin rejuvenates old hematopoietic stem cells in mice, enhancing resistance to influenza (H1N1) and increasing survival.
*   Short-course rapamycin in elderly humans increased annual influenza vaccine titer levels by 20% and reduced the immune dysfunction marker PD-1 on CD4 and CD8 T cells.
*   In an immunosenescence model, rapamycin improved age-related deficits, such as foot pad swelling, demonstrating malleability of aging with interventions.
*   Single-nuclei RNA sequencing in mice revealed that rapamycin shifts age-altered immune cell populations back towards a youthful proportion, specifically reducing exhausted T cells and their associated markers.

## Mouse Data

*   Rapamycin administration to mice rejuvenates old hematopoietic stem cells.
*   Older mice treated with rapamycin demonstrated increased resistance to influenza (H1N1) challenge and improved survival rates.
*   In an immunosenescence model, rapamycin treatment improved age-related deficits, such as reductions in foot pad swelling, indicating that aging is, to some degree, malleable with such interventions.

## Human Evidence

*   A study by Novartis involving elderly individuals addressed their typically poor response to vaccination, which often requires significantly higher vaccine doses compared to younger individuals.
*   **Protocol:**
    *   Elderly individuals received short-course rapamycin.
*   **Findings:**
    *   Annual influenza vaccine titer levels increased by 20% in the elderly, a significant improvement.
    *   Rapalog (a version of rapamycin) treatment reduced PD-1, a marker of immune dysfunction, on both CD4 and CD8 T cells, suggesting a benefit for vaccination.

## Current Research Focus

Current research is broadly investigating which immune cell types are rejuvenated by mTOR inhibition or rapamycin treatment, building on prior disparate studies showing effects on T cells and gamma delta T cells.

*   **Study Methodology:**
    *   Mice (equivalent to 55-60 human years old) received rapamycin for seven months starting at 18 months of age.
    *   The study investigates sex-based differences.
    *   The goal is to identify immune cell types that exhibit a more youthful expression profile, indicating rejuvenation or restored resiliency by rapamycin.
    *   Future work involves functional assays on identified beneficial cell types (e.g., improved phagocytosis for macrophages, better stimulation and reduced hyper-inflammation for T cells).
*   **Single-Nuclei RNA Sequencing Findings:**
    *   Immune cell populations from spleens show age-related increases or decreases in various cell types.
    *   Rapamycin treatment shifts these age-altered populations back towards a younger proportion.
    *   Gene expression analysis indicates a reduction in exhausted T cells and their associated markers within the population following rapamycin treatment.
