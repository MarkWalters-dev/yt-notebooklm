# 2024-01-21 Trigonelline Increases NAD Improves Muscle Function And Extends Lifespan - Vincenzo Sorrentino PhD

**Executive Summary**

*   Trigonelline, a methylated form of nicotinic acid found in plants like coffee and fenugreek, is a novel and highly stable NAD+ precursor.
*   In human studies, lower serum trigonelline levels correlate with sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss and dysfunction), and higher levels are observed in healthy centenarians.
*   Preclinical studies in human cells, C. elegans, and aging mice demonstrate that trigonelline effectively increases NAD+ levels and functions primarily through the Preiss-Handler pathway of NAD+ biosynthesis.
*   Trigonelline supplementation improves mitochondrial function, enhances muscle integrity, mobility, and resilience to fatigue in aging C. elegans and mice, and extends lifespan in C. elegans.
*   Unlike other NAD+ precursors like Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) and Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN), trigonelline exhibits superior stability in human serum, making it a promising candidate for maintaining NAD+ levels.

## Sarcopenia: An Age-Associated Muscle Disease

Sarcopenia is characterized by a decline in muscle mass and, crucially, a loss of functional outcomes suchasting strength and mobility. Its prevalence increases significantly with age. From a molecular perspective, sarcopenia shares many hallmarks with general aging, including:

*   Increased inflammation
*   Dysfunctional mitochondria (impaired energy production)
*   Increased oxidative stress
*   Increased fibrotic damage (compromising muscle elasticity)
*   Dysfunction of satellite cells (muscle stem cells critical for regeneration)
*   Imbalance in protein turnover (more catabolism than synthesis)

Clinically, sarcopenia is diagnosed based on three key parameters:
*   Gate speed
*   Grip strength
*   Appendicular lean mass (lean mass in the limbs)

## The Critical Role of NAD+ in Aging and Health

NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is a coenzyme essential for over 500 reactions in the body, playing a crucial role in most cellular hallmarks of aging. It supports mitochondrial function, redox reactions, reduces inflammation, and facilitates DNA repair. Maintaining NAD+ levels through exercise, diet, or supplementation has been shown preclinically to benefit nearly every organ system, both during normal aging and in age-associated diseases.

## Human Evidence: Trigonelline Levels and Muscle Health

**Singaporean Sarcopenia Study:**
An observational study compared healthy elderly Singaporean males with age-matched individuals diagnosed with sarcopenia. Muscle biopsies revealed:
*   Downregulation of mitochondrial transcription pathways and proteins.
*   Significantly lower NAD+ levels in sarcopenic muscle tissue.
*   A positive correlation between muscle NAD+ levels and muscle function (grip strength, gait speed, appendicular lean mass).

Serum metabolomics from the same cohort identified specific metabolites that changed systemically in sarcopenia. Among various vitamin B3-related compounds (NAD+ precursors), **trigonelline** was the only one significantly downregulated in sarcopenia. Furthermore, serum trigonelline levels positively correlated with the three clinical outcomes of muscle health (lean mass, grip strength, walking speed). Analysis also showed that higher serum trigonelline levels were associated with the enrichment of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathways in muscle, suggesting a link to improved mitochondrial function.

**Iranian Cohort Replication:**
These findings were replicated in a larger Iranian cohort (over 100 individuals), confirming the positive association between grip strength and serum trigonelline levels. Interestingly, this association was not linked to caffeine or general vitamin B3 intake, but showed a partial association with folate and fiber, hinting at a potential connection with one-carbon metabolism or the folate cycle.

## What is Trigonelline?

Trigonelline (methylnicotinic acid) is a methylated form of nicotinic acid. It is predominantly found in plants, particularly in fenugreek seeds and coffee beans, and to a lesser extent, can be produced by the human gut microbiome. Previous literature suggests it has beneficial metabolic effects, such as lowering plasma and liver cholesterol, improving glucose transport, and acting in models of diabetic disease and liver disease. Historically, an old Japanese study showed that adding trigonelline to liver extracts could lead to its demethylation into niacin (nicotinic acid).

## Stability Advantage of Trigonelline

A critical parameter for supplements and drugs is stability. While NAD+ precursors like Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) and Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) are known to be effective, they can be degraded into nicotinic acid or nicotinamide by the gut microbiome and are relatively unstable in human serum.
*   When spiked into human serum at 37°C, NR and NMN rapidly disappear.
*   Trigonelline, however, remains highly stable in serum for over 24 hours (and even 48 hours), showing minimal degradation and not converting into nicotinamide. Its simpler structure, lacking a ribose group, contributes to its enhanced stability compared to NR and NMN.

## Mechanism of Action: Trigonelline as an NAD+ Precursor

Trigonelline's mechanism involves its conversion to NAD+ via the Preiss-Handler pathway.

### NAD+ Biosynthesis Pathways

NAD+ is synthesized through several pathways:
*   **Salvage Pathway:** Nicotinamide (NAM) -> Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) -> NAD+
*   **Preiss-Handler Pathway:** Nicotinic Acid (NA) -> Nicotinic Acid Mononucleotide (NaMN) -> Nicotinic Acid Adenine Dinucleotide (NaAD) -> NAD+

**Trigonelline's Proposed Route:**
Trigonelline --(Demethylation)--> Nicotinic Acid (NA) --> NaMN --> NaAD --> NAD+

Key enzymes in these pathways include Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) for the salvage pathway and Nicotinic Acid Phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT or NAPT) for the Preiss-Handler pathway.

### In vitro Inhibition Studies

Experiments using primary human myotube cells (HSMM cells) and specific inhibitors demonstrated trigonelline's pathway dependency:
*   Both trigonelline and NR significantly increased NAD+ levels in cells.
*   Inhibition of the Preiss-Handler pathway with 2-Droxynicotinic acid blocked trigonelline's ability to increase NAD+, but did not affect NR's ability (as NR can utilize the salvage pathway).
*   Inhibition of the salvage pathway with FK866 caused strong NAD+ depletion, which both trigonelline and NR could rescue.
*   However, when both the Preiss-Handler and salvage pathways were inhibited, trigonelline's effect was completely lost, confirming its primary reliance on the Preiss-Handler pathway for NAD+ production.

### Mitochondrial Function Studies

NAD+ is crucial for mitochondrial health.
*   Blocking the salvage pathway with FK866 decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and respiration.
*   Supplementation with NR or trigonelline rescued these mitochondrial dysfunctions.
*   However, when the Preiss-Handler pathway was also inhibited, trigonelline was no longer effective in rescuing mitochondrial function, while NR could still partially function.
*   Despite NR often inducing higher NAD+ levels in cells, the functional improvements in mitochondrial health (respiration, membrane potential) between NR and trigonelline were comparable, highlighting that absolute NAD+ levels may not always directly correlate with functional outcomes.

## Preclinical Evidence: NAD+ Boosting, Muscle Function, and Lifespan

### In vitro (Human Myotubes)

*   Trigonelline increased NAD+ levels in a dose-dependent manner in primary human myotube cells from both healthy donors and sarcopenic patients, suggesting its conversion to NAD+ intermediates occurs even in sarcopenic conditions.

### C. elegans Studies

*   Aged C. elegans (day 8) showed a decline in NAD+ levels, which was significantly rescued by 8 days of trigonelline supplementation.
*   Trigonelline supplementation for 10 days improved muscle fiber integrity and mobility in aging worms, reducing age-associated paralysis.
*   Lifespan was extended by approximately 17.4% in trigonelline-treated worms (up to 30 days compared to 24-25 days in controls).
*   Genetic repression of NAPRT (the key enzyme for the Preiss-Handler pathway in worms) abolished most of trigonelline's beneficial effects on lifespan and muscle function, further confirming its mechanism of action via this pathway in vivo.

### Mouse Studies

**NAD+ Bioavailability:**
Young mice (3 months old) gavaged with trigonelline (300 mg/kg, equimolar to typical NR doses in rodent studies) showed significantly increased NAD+ levels in the liver, muscle, kidney, and blood within 2 hours.

**Trigonelline Tissue Levels:**
Following gavage, trigonelline levels increased substantially in liver, muscle (gastrocnemius), kidney, and plasma within 2 hours. While a large amount was excreted in urine, tissue levels reached high micromolar ranges (e.g., 100-250 micromolar in plasma after 2 hours). After an overnight washout period (>12 hours), trigonelline levels generally returned close to baseline in most tissues, with some retention in the liver. This suggests a relatively quick clearance but also measurable bioavailability.

**Chronic Supplementation in Aging Mice (Muscle Resilience and Grip Strength):**
Two-year-old aging mice were fed either a control diet or a trigonelline-supplemented diet (same 300 mg/kg equivalent dose) for three months.
*   No significant impact on overall limb lean mass or peak muscle force at baseline was observed, possibly because mice require a more geriatric age to show consistent lean mass loss.
*   However, when muscles were subjected to repeated contractions to induce fatigue, trigonelline-treated mice showed improved muscle resilience, maintaining a significantly higher percentage of initial force compared to age-matched controls. This indicates enhanced ability to sustain contractions.
*   A small but significant increase in grip strength was also measured in the trigonelline-supplemented mice.

## Future Research Directions

While the current research provides strong evidence for trigonelline's role as a stable NAD+ precursor with muscle and longevity benefits, several key questions remain:

*   **Optimal Dosing:** Determining the minimal effective dose for humans and understanding the dose-response relationship for NAD+ boosting and functional outcomes.
*   **Methyl Group Fate:** Investigating the destination of the methyl group released during trigonelline's demethylation to nicotinic acid. Potential implications include contributions to the homocysteine cycle (which impacts vascular health and dementia risk), S-adenosyl methionine (involved in melatonin production and sleep), and epigenetic modifications (methylation patterns and clocks).
*   **Gut Microbiome Interaction:** Identifying specific bacterial species responsible for trigonelline production or metabolism in the human gut and understanding the conditions under which this occurs.
*   **Clinical Relevance:** Further studies are needed to understand the clinical impact of trigonelline supplementation on muscle health in humans, particularly in sarcopenic populations.
*   **Context of Disease:** Reconciling the observation of increased trigonelline in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with preclinical data showing benefits of trigonelline supplementation in models of diabetic nephropathy. This points to the complexity of disease contexts and the distinction between naturally elevated levels in disease states versus therapeutic supplementation.
*   **Centenarian Link:** Further investigating the implications of higher trigonelline levels observed in healthy centenarians, especially regarding potential links to longevity mechanisms beyond kidney function.
