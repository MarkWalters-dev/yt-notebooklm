# 2025-04-23 Dave Pascoe Presents His Blood Test Results - Kidney Function Biomarkers

## Executive Summary

*   **Creatinine Trend:** Creatinine levels have shown a decreasing trend, which is generally positive, but may be influenced by creatine supplementation and travel-related changes in intake.
*   **Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) Increase:** Despite a decreasing creatinine trend, BUN has been increasing. This, coupled with stable protein intake claims, could suggest a decline in kidney function.
*   **Uric Acid Decrease:** Uric acid levels have been decreasing, which is a positive sign. This contradicts an age-related decline in kidney function and aligns with moving towards lower all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Cystatin C Importance:** Cystatin C is a strong predictor of GrimAge and is less sensitive to muscle mass changes than creatinine, making it a valuable marker for kidney function.
*   **Protein Intake and BUN:** The increasing BUN, despite claimed stable protein intake and decreasing uric acid, raises the possibility that protein intake might be slightly too high, potentially impacting gut barrier function.

## Kidney Function Biomarkers

### Creatinine
*   The trend for creatinine shows a decrease over time, starting from a relatively high point in 2017.
*   Potential influencing factors for the decrease include reduced creatine supplementation and less frequent consumption due to travel.

### Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)
*   BUN levels have been increasing over time.
*   If protein intake is constant, an increase in BUN could suggest a decline in kidney function as the kidneys are responsible for removing urea from the blood.
*   However, the interpretation is complicated if protein intake has not been constant.

### Uric Acid
*   Uric acid levels are decreasing.
*   This trend is interpreted as positive, suggesting a movement towards lower all-cause mortality risk.
*   An age-related decline in kidney function would typically be associated with an increase in uric acid.

### Cystatin C
*   Cystatin C is a marker of kidney function that is less sensitive to changes in muscle mass compared to creatinine.
*   It has shown a very high correlation (around 0.9) with the GrimAge epigenetic clock score.
*   Cystatin C is now being included in regular testing to monitor and aim for lower levels.
*   Data points for cystatin C are currently limited but will be collected more frequently going forward.

### Other Relevant Biomarkers

*   **Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR):** This measure is derived from creatinine and therefore reflects similar trends.
*   **Beta-2 Microglobulin:** This biomarker will be included in testing starting next week and is another predictor of GrimAge.
*   **GDF 15, Temp 1, and PAI-1:** These are noted as strong predictors of GrimAge, with GDF 15 not being commercially available and PAI-1 having a weaker correlation.

## Interpretation of Kidney Function Trends

*   The decrease in creatinine is positive but cannot definitively confirm improved kidney function due to potential creatine supplementation influence.
*   The increase in BUN, when considered alongside stable protein intake, could indicate reduced kidney function.
*   The decrease in uric acid is a strong positive indicator, counteracting the suggestion of declining kidney function.
*   The increasing BUN, despite decreasing uric acid, raises a question about whether protein intake might be slightly too high, potentially affecting gut barrier function (indicated by increased urea circulating to the intestine).
*   An experiment to reduce protein intake by 10-20 grams could be considered to observe potential reductions in BUN and improvements in other biomarkers like hs-CRP or alkaline phosphatase.

## Total Protein
*   Total protein is a measure of albumin and globulins, not a direct indicator of protein intake.
*   In many cases, protein intake does not correlate tightly with albumin, globulins, or total protein levels.
