# 2024-08-16 17.6y Younger Biological Age - Supplements Blood Test 5 In 2024

### Executive Summary

*   Biological age, calculated using the PhenoAge calculator, was found to be 17.6 years younger than chronological age.
*   Daily Levothyroxine (137.5 mcg) is a consistent prescription medication for hypothyroidism.
*   Intermittent Vitamin D supplementation (1000 IU/day for 23 of 59 days), combined with infrequent sun exposure, resulted in a circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 38 ng/mL, which is within the optimal range (>30 ng/mL) for all-cause mortality risk.
*   Nicotinic acid (50-60 mg/day for 30 of 59 days) was observed to increase intracellular NAD levels to 27.8 µM, a favorable jump from previous lower levels.
*   A single-day trial of Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAA) (5 g/day) was performed to test its impact on homocysteine, but no reduction in homocysteine was observed.

## Prescription Medications

The individual has been diagnosed with hypothyroidism in their 20s and consistently takes **Levothyroxine** at 137.5 micrograms per day.

## Supplements

This section details supplements taken during the 59-day period between Blood Test 4 (May 28) and Blood Test 5 (June 25).

### Vitamin D

*   **Supplementation:** 1000 IUs of Vitamin D per day, taken for 23 of the 59 days. This irregular supplementation occurred during the non-summer months (8-9 months of the year).
*   **Sun Exposure:** Infrequent, with only four days of full-body sun exposure, up to 30 minutes per session.
*   **Testing Protocol for Circulating Vitamin D Levels:**
    *   Utilized Ulta Labs to order specific tests without physician involvement.
    *   Printed the lab order form.
    *   Brought the form to a Quest Diagnostics facility for blood draw.
    *   Received results within 24 hours.
*   **Circulating Levels:** On the day of Blood Test 5, circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured at 38 ng/mL.
*   **Optimal Levels (Meta-Analysis):**
    *   A meta-analysis of 32 studies investigated the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and all-cause mortality risk (hazard ratio).
    *   Levels between 20-29 ng/mL, and especially below 20 ng/mL, were significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk (hazard ratio significantly above 1).
    *   Levels greater than 30 ng/mL were not significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk (95% confidence interval overlapped with a hazard ratio of 1).
    *   **Conclusion:** Optimal circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are considered to be anything greater than 30 ng/mL. The individual's level of 38 ng/mL falls within this optimal range.
*   **Future Optimization:** A more specific approach to determine optimal vitamin D levels would involve measuring 25-hydroxyvitamin D alongside all other biomarkers for every blood test to identify correlations with glucose, creatinine, hs-CRP, etc., which change during aging and impact all-cause mortality risk. However, the current return on investment for such extensive data collection is not considered high if levels are already above 30 ng/mL.

### Nicotinic Acid

*   **Supplementation:** 50-60 mg per day, taken for 30 of the 59 days.
*   **Preparation:** Bulk nicotinic acid powder was dissolved in water to create a stock solution, allowing for precise dosage without additional fillers found in pills or capsules.
*   **Purpose:** Potentially increase NAD levels.
*   **NAD Measurement:** Blood was sent to Ginfinity for intracellular NAD analysis.
*   **NAD Levels:** On July 26 (the same day as Blood Test 5), intracellular NAD levels were 27.8 µM, which is close to the individual's average of 30 µM and a notable increase from previous lows below 20 µM.

### Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAA)

*   **Supplementation:** 5 grams per day, taken for only one day of the 59-day period.
*   **Purpose:** An experiment initiated after Blood Test 4 to investigate if BCAA could impact homocysteine levels through the gut, based on a paper in a Parkinson's animal model.
*   **Results:** Homocysteine levels were not reduced in response to the additional 5 grams per day of BCAA. Consequently, BCAA supplementation was discontinued.

No other geroprotectors or senolytics were taken during this period.
