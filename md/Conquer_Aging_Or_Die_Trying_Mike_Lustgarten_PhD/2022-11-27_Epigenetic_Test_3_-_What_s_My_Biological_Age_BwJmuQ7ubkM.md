# 2022-11-27 Epigenetic Test 3 - What s My Biological Age

## Executive Summary

*   **Hannum Extrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration (EEAA):** 40 years, 10 years younger than chronological age, but 2-3 years older than previous tests (36.87 and 37.47 years). This marker reflects immune system aging.
*   **Dunedin PACE:** 0.89, indicating a slower pace of aging, but slightly worse than previous tests (0.8 and 0.82). A value of 0.6 is the slowest aging rate, while 1.4 is the fastest.
*   **Horvath Intrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration (IEAA):** 56.34 years, 7 years older than chronological age, and the worst result among all tests (previous results were 55 and 53.5 years). This marker reflects cell intrinsic aging.
*   **Correlations with Worsened Epigenetic Age (Test 3 vs. Test 2):** Significantly higher body weight, worse cardiovascular fitness (increased resting heart rate, decreased heart rate variability), and higher total fat intake (specifically Brazil nuts, monounsaturated fatty acids, total nuts/seeds, peanuts).
*   **Unexpected Correlations:** Higher light sleep and total sleep, and significantly *lower* calorie intake were observed prior to the period with worse epigenetic data.

## Epigenetic Test Results

### Hannum Extrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration (EEAA)

The Hannum test is a marker of immune system aging.

*   **October Test (Test 3):** Hannum epigenetic age was 40 years, 10 years younger than chronological age.
*   **May Test (Test 1):** Hannum epigenetic age was 36.87 years, 12 years younger than chronological age.
*   **July Test (Test 2):** Hannum epigenetic age was 37.47 years, 12 years younger than chronological age.

The most recent test (Test 3) shows an epigenetic age 2-3 years older compared to Test 1 and Test 2.

### Dunedin PACE

Dunedin PACE measures the pace of aging calculated from the epigenome.

*   **October Test (Test 3):** Dunedin PACE value was 0.89.
    *   A value of 0.6 indicates the slowest epigenetic aging rate (epigenetic age increases by 0.6 years for every 1 chronological year).
    *   A value of 1.4 indicates the fastest epigenetic aging rate (epigenetic age increases by 1.4 years for every 1 chronological year).
*   **May Test (Test 1):** Dunedin PACE value was 0.8.
*   **July Test (Test 2):** Dunedin PACE value was 0.82.

The Dunedin PACE value of 0.89 for Test 3 is good, but not as favorable as the values from Test 1 and Test 2.

### Horvath Intrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration (IEAA)

The Horvath test is a marker of cell intrinsic aging.

*   **October Test (Test 3):** Horvath epigenetic age was 56.34 years, 7 years older than chronological age. This is the worst Horvath epigenetic age recorded across the three tests.
*   **May Test (Test 1):** Horvath epigenetic age was 55 years, 6 years older than chronological age.
*   **July Test (Test 2):** Horvath epigenetic age was 53.5 years, 4 years older than chronological age.

There is significant room for improvement in the Horvath epigenetic age data.

## Analysis of Potential Contributing Factors

The approach to identify potential contributing factors involves comparing differences in lifestyle variables over a 30-day period prior to each test.

### Methodology for Variable Comparison

To identify potential factors influencing epigenetic age, 93 variables were compared for the 30-day period prior to Test 2 and Test 3.

*   **Body Weight Measurement:**
    *   Weighed every morning after using the bathroom (after bowel movement and urination).
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Cardiovascular metrics (e.g., resting heart rate, heart rate variability) from a fitness tracker.
    *   Sleep metrics (total sleep, individual sleep stages) from a fitness tracker.
    *   Macro and micronutrients, and individual food amounts, from diet tracking.
*   **Statistical Analysis:**
    *   Variables were identified as significantly different if they had a p-value less than 0.05 and a false discovery rate (FDR or adjusted p-value) less than 0.1, to account for multiple comparisons.

### Significant Differences Between Test 2 and Test 3

The following variables were significantly different (p < 0.05, FDR < 0.1) for the 30-day period prior to Test 3 (which yielded worse epigenetic data) compared to Test 2:

*   **Body Weight:**
    *   **Test 2 Avg:** 151.5 lbs
    *   **Test 3 Avg:** 152.2 lbs
    *   Body weight was significantly higher prior to Test 3.

*   **Dietary Factors:**
    *   **Brazil Nuts (Selenium source):** Significantly higher intake prior to Test 3.
    *   **Mono Unsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFA):** Significantly higher intake prior to Test 3.
    *   **Total Nuts and Seeds:** Significantly higher intake prior to Test 3.
    *   **Peanuts:** Significantly higher intake prior to Test 3.
    *   **Total Fat:** Significantly higher intake prior to Test 3 (Test 3 average: ~87 grams/day vs. Test 2 average: ~81 grams/day). This suggests higher total fat intake may be negatively correlated with epigenetic age.
    *   **Calories:** Significantly *lower* intake prior to Test 3. This is an unexpected correlation, as higher calorie intake is typically associated with worse epigenetic data.

*   **Cardiovascular Fitness Metrics (Indicating worse fitness):**
    *   **Resting Heart Rate (RHR):** Increased from 44 bpm (Test 2) to 45.5 bpm (Test 3).
    *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** Decreased from 65 (Test 2) to 59 (Test 3).

*   **Sleep Metrics (Unexpectedly higher):**
    *   **Light Sleep:** Increased from 2.9 hours (Test 2) to 3.5 hours (Test 3).
    *   **Total Sleep:** Increased from 7.2 hours (Test 2) to 7.6 hours (Test 3).

### Proposed Intervention for Next Test

To investigate the observed correlations, particularly regarding fat intake, an intervention is planned for the period leading up to the next epigenetic test (Test 4):

*   Reduce total fat intake to approximately 81 grams per day, similar to the intake prior to Test 2.
*   Maintain Brazil nut and selenium intake relatively higher than prior to Test 2.

The goal is to determine if a reduced fat intake can improve epigenetic age without negatively impacting other blood biomarkers.
