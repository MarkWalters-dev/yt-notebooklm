# 2023-06-11 Grape Seed Proanthocyanidins Increase NAD

## Executive Summary

*   Quinolinic acid levels increase significantly with aging in humans, correlating with an age-related decline in NAD levels.
*   The conversion of quinolinic acid to NAD involves three key enzymes: quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT), NMN adenylyltransferase, and NAD synthase 1.
*   Grape seed proanthocyanidins (PAC) increase the gene expression of QPRT and NAD synthase 1 in rats in a dose-dependent manner.
*   Supplementation with grape seed proanthocyanidins significantly increases liver NAD content in rats (up to 4-fold at 50 mg/kg) and plasma NAD levels in aged mice.
*   Human equivalent doses for these effects range from approximately 536 mg to 1344 mg of grape seed proanthocyanidins daily, which could be achieved with 3.4 to 8.4 grams of whole grape seeds.

## Age-Related NAD Decline and Quinolinic Acid

The *de novo* NAD synthesis pathway converts tryptophan into NAD. An age-related decline in vitamin B6 (pyridoxal 5-phosphate or P5P) may limit this conversion. Additionally, quinolinic acid levels increase during aging, representing another potential age-related block in this pathway.

**Evidence for Increased Quinolinic Acid with Aging:**

*   In a study of individuals with a median age of 59 years at baseline, quinolinic acid levels significantly increased over an eleven-year period.
*   Centenarians (average age 97 years) exhibited 2.8-fold higher quinolinic acid levels compared to their offspring.

The accumulation of quinolinic acid during aging, in conjunction with NAD decline, suggests that the enzymes responsible for its conversion to NAD are affected.

**Metabolic Pathway: Tryptophan to NAD via Quinolinic Acid**

```
Tryptophan
    ↓ (via de novo NAD synthesis pathway, potentially limited by age-related B6 decline)
Quinolinic Acid
    ↓ (Three enzymatic steps)
NAD
```

**Key Enzymes in Quinolinic Acid Conversion to NAD:**

The conversion of quinolinic acid into NAD involves three distinct enzymatic steps:
*   **QPRT** (quinolinic phosphoribosyltransferase)
*   **NMN adenylyltransferase**
*   **NAD synthase 1** (NAD syn 1)

## Grape Seed Proanthocyanidins (PAC) and NAD Pathway Enzymes

Research indicates that grape seed proanthocyanidins can increase the expression of genes involved in NAD synthesis.

**Rat Data: Grape Seed Proanthocyanidins and Gene Expression**

Young rats were fed four different diets:
*   0 mg PAC/kg food (control)
*   5 mg PAC/kg food
*   25 mg PAC/kg food
*   50 mg PAC/kg food

**Findings:**
*   **QPRT Gene Expression:** QPRT mRNA levels in the liver increased with higher dietary content of proanthocyanidins, showing a dose-response relationship.
*   **NAD Synthase 1 Gene Expression:** NAD synthase 1 gene expression also increased in response to proanthocyanidins. The lowest dose (5 mg/kg) initiated an increase, and while higher levels further increased expression, it plateaued after 5 mg/kg.

## Grape Seed Proanthocyanidins Increase NAD Levels

Increasing gene expression is a positive indicator, and studies confirm that grape seed proanthocyanidin supplementation directly increases NAD content.

**Rat Liver NAD Content:**
*   While the lowest dose of proanthocyanidins (5 mg/kg) did not significantly increase liver NAD content, both 25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg doses did.
*   The 50 mg/kg dose resulted in approximately a 4-fold increase in liver NAD content.

**Human Equivalent Dose (Based on Rat Study):**
To calculate the human equivalent dose from the rat study, the highest effective dose (50 mg/kg) is divided by a body size conversion factor of 6.2:
*   50 mg PAC/kg (rat) / 6.2 = **8.1 mg PAC/kg human body weight**.
*   For an individual weighing 66 kg, this equates to approximately **536 mg of grape seed proanthocyanidins per day**.

**Mouse Plasma NAD Content:**
*   Plasma NAD levels were observed to decline during aging in mice (from 2 to 18 months old).
*   18-month-old mice fed a grape seed proanthocyanin extract (GSPE) at a dose of 250 mg/kg body weight showed a significant increase in plasma NAD levels.
*   The authors theorized that GSPE might increase the bioavailability or content of NMN, which is then converted into NAD, though they did not specifically investigate quinolinic acid conversion in this study.

**Human Equivalent Dose (Based on Mouse Study):**
To calculate the human equivalent dose from the mouse study, the effective dose (250 mg GSPE/kg) is divided by a body size conversion factor of 12.3:
*   250 mg GSPE/kg (mouse) / 12.3 = **20.3 mg GSPE/kg human body weight**.
*   For an individual weighing 66 kg, this equates to approximately **1344 mg of grape seed proanthocyanin extract per day**.

## Whole Food Considerations: Grape Seed Intake

For those preferring whole foods over supplements, it's possible to estimate the equivalent intake of whole grape seeds.
*   The average proanthocyanin content in grape seeds from 37 varieties is approximately 160 milligrams per gram of seed.

**Equivalent Whole Grape Seed Intake:**
*   **Based on Rat Study (536 mg PAC/day):** 536 mg PAC / 160 mg PAC/gram seed = **3.4 grams of grape seeds per day**.
*   **Based on Mouse Study (1344 mg GSPE/day):** 1344 mg GSPE / 160 mg GSPE/gram seed = **8.4 grams of grape seeds per day**.

## Personal Experiment and Future Research

As human studies on grape seeds or their extracts increasing NAD are currently lacking, a personal experiment is underway to investigate these effects.

**Personal Experiment Protocol:**
*   Began consuming 6 grams of grape seed powder daily on June 7.
*   NAD levels will be tested around June 19 using a commercial NAD quantification kit.
*   There is an openness to increase the dose to 12 grams per day if initial results are not observed.

**Contingency Plan:**
*   If grape seed powder supplementation does not yield the desired increase in NAD, the focus will shift back to the NAD salvage pathway and exploring compounds like niacin, nicotinamide riboside (NR), or nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN).
