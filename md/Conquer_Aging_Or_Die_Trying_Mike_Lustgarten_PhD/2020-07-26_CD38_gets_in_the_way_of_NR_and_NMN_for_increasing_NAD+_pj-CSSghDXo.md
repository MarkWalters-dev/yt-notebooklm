# 2020-07-26 CD38 gets in the way of NR and NMN for increasing NAD+

## Executive Summary

*   CD38 is a key enzyme that degrades NAD+, and its activity increases with age and conditions like obesity.
*   CD38 also directly degrades nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), reducing their efficacy as NAD+ precursors.
*   In mice, CD38 knockout significantly increases and stabilizes NR and NMN levels post-supplementation compared to wild-type mice.
*   Human studies show that NR supplementation fails to increase NAD+ levels in obese individuals, suggesting a link between obesity, increased endotoxin (LPS), and CD38 activity.
*   Calorie restriction (CR) reduces endotoxin levels, which may lead to lower CD38 expression and subsequently enhance NAD+ levels, potentially explaining CR's lifespan-extending effects.

## Introduction to NAD+ and CD38

NAD+ levels decline during aging, largely due to degradation by CD38. Supplementation with NR or NMN is proposed to increase NAD+ levels because:
*   NR is converted to NMN.
*   NMN is converted to NAD+.

However, CD38 also degrades NR and NMN, complicating their effectiveness.

## CD38 Degrades NR and NMN in Mice

### NR Degradation by CD38

*   **Study Design:** Wild-type mice and CD38 knockout mice were injected intraperitoneally with NR. NR levels were monitored over time (30, 75, and 150 minutes post-injection).
*   **Findings:**
    *   In wild-type mice (possessing CD38), NR levels rapidly declined after injection.
    *   In CD38 knockout mice, NR levels remained stable over time.
*   **Conclusion:** This strongly suggests that CD38 degrades NR.

### NMN Degradation by CD38

*   **Study Design:** A similar approach to the NR study was used, but with NMN supplementation.
*   **Findings:**
    *   Wild-type mice showed a rapid decline in NMN levels after supplementation.
    *   CD38 knockout mice maintained higher NMN levels compared to wild-type mice.
*   **Conclusion:** CD38 also degrades NMN.

**Implication:** For optimal efficacy of NR and NMN supplementation in boosting NAD+ levels, maintaining low CD38 activity is crucial.

## Inconsistent Efficacy of NR Supplementation in Humans

Despite the theoretical benefits, some human studies show NR supplementation does not increase NAD+ levels.

*   **Study 1:** 1000 mg/day NR increased NAD+ levels.
*   **Study 2:** 2000 mg/day NR did not increase NAD+ levels compared to placebo.
*   **Study 3:** 1000 mg/day NR did not increase NAD+ levels.

### The Role of Obesity and BMI

The key difference between these studies appears to be the Body Mass Index (BMI) of the participants:

*   **Study 1 (Successful):** Average BMI of 24 (normal weight, BMI < 25).
*   **Studies 2 & 3 (Unsuccessful):** Average BMI of 30 and 33 respectively (obese).

**Observation:** NR supplementation was ineffective in obese subjects but effective in normal-weight subjects.

## Obesity, Endotoxin (LPS), and CD38 Upregulation

### Increased Endotoxin in Obesity

*   **Measurement:** Serum endotoxin activity was measured in normal-weight and obese individuals.
*   **Findings:** Obese subjects (BMI ~30) had significantly higher levels of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) compared to normal-weight subjects (BMI ~23).

### Endotoxin (LPS) and CD38 Gene Expression

*   **Background:** LPS is a component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria.
*   **Study:** Macrophages exposed to LPS showed increased CD38 gene expression:
    *   After 24 hours: Five-fold increase.
    *   After 48 hours: Seven-fold increase.
*   **Further Effect:** LPS exposure also leads to the release of CD38 from macrophages into circulation.

**Link:** Increased circulating LPS in obesity can lead to higher systemic CD38 levels, potentially explaining the lack of NAD+ increase from NR supplementation in obese individuals.

## CD38 and Aging

### Endotoxin (LPS) Increases with Age

*   **Mouse Data:** Plasma endotoxin levels were higher in adult mice (18 months old, equivalent to ~54 human years) compared to young mice (4 months old, equivalent to ~12 human years). This showed a ~2-fold increase.
*   **Human Data:** Plasma endotoxin levels were higher in older adults (74 years old) compared to young adults (26 years old), also showing approximately a 2-fold increase.

**Implication:** Age-related increases in LPS may contribute to elevated CD38 expression and activity, potentially reducing the efficacy of NR and NMN supplementation in older individuals.

## Calorie Restriction (CR) and its Impact on LPS and NAD+

### CR Reduces Endotoxin Levels

*   **Study:** Calorie-restricted (40% fewer calories) mice had approximately half the serum endotoxin (LPS) levels compared to mice fed ad libitum.
*   **Significance:** CR is known to extend lifespan in various organisms. Reducing LPS may be a mechanism by which CR lowers CD38 levels and improves NAD+ metabolism.

### CR and NAD+ Levels

*   While direct human randomized controlled trials measuring NAD+ with CR were not found, CR is well-documented to increase NAD+ in model organisms (yeast, worms).
*   **Hypothesis:** CR's ability to reduce systemic LPS may lead to lower CD38 expression, thereby increasing NAD+ levels.

## Future Hypotheses

*   **CR + NR/NMN:** Combining calorie restriction with NR or NMN supplementation may lead to even greater NAD+ increases, potentially maximizing NAD+ levels.
*   **Calorie Restriction Mechanism:** A primary mechanism for CR's lifespan-extending benefits might involve its ability to reduce systemic LPS.
