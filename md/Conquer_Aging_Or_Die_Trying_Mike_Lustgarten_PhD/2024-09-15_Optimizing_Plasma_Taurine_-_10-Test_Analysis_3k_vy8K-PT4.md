# 2024-09-15 Optimizing Plasma Taurine - 10-Test Analysis

## Executive Summary

*   Taurine levels decline with age, and maintaining higher levels appears to be associated with better health outcomes, including lower glucose and reduced risk of diabetes and hypertension.
*   Personal plasma taurine levels have been maintained above levels expected for chronological age, ranging from 113 µmol/L in 2023 to 118 µmol/L in 2024, successfully avoiding age-related decline over a 14-month period.
*   A significant positive correlation (r = 0.69, p < 0.05) was found between plasma taurine levels and average daily zinc intake, suggesting zinc may play a role in maintaining taurine levels.
*   The study protocol involves detailed dietary tracking using Cronometer and correlating this data with blood test results to identify nutrient associations with biomarkers.
*   Future optimization strategies may involve increasing zinc intake to potentially further elevate plasma taurine levels, aiming for levels closer to those seen in younger individuals (e.g., 130-140 µmol/L).

## Background: Taurine and Healthspan

Taurine is implicated in numerous aging hallmarks, including:
*   Inhibition of cellular senescence
*   Mitigation of telomere shortening
*   Improvement of mitochondrial dysfunction

At the molecular level, taurine influences epigenetic changes. At the organellar level, it impacts mitochondrial health. At the cellular level, it affects stem cells.

Taurine deficiency is associated with various adverse health conditions:
*   Elevated glucose and diabetes
*   Hypertension (high blood pressure)
*   Liver disease
*   Obesity-related measures

Fortunately, taurine levels can be monitored and potentially optimized.

## Personal Taurine Data and Analysis

### Historical Taurine Levels (2023)

*   **Average Plasma Taurine (2023):** 113 µmol/L (based on 5 tests)
*   **Note:** The conversion from millimolar to micromolar is significant for comparative analysis.

### Age-Related Taurine Decline

*   Studies show a decline in serum taurine levels from birth to approximately 60 years of age.

### Taurine Levels (2024) and Age-Related Decline Avoidance

*   **Average Plasma Taurine (2024):** 118 µmol/L (based on 5 tests)
*   **Observation:** Over a 14-month period, the average taurine levels have remained stable, successfully avoiding the typical age-related decline.

### Taurine Levels vs. Chronological Age Expectation

*   **Expected Taurine for 51-year-old:** Approximately 75 µmol/L
*   **Observed Taurine (2023-2024):** 113-118 µmol/L
*   **Interpretation:** Current taurine levels are higher than expected for chronological age, aligning with levels seen in individuals approximately 20 years younger.

### Target Taurine Levels

*   **Newborn Levels:** Approximately 220 µmol/L
*   **20-Year-Old Average Levels:** Approximately 130-140 µmol/L
*   **Goal:** To increase taurine levels towards the 130-140 µmol/L range, considered optimal post-maturity.

## Methodology: Dietary Correlation Analysis

The approach to optimizing biomarkers involves detailed tracking and correlation analysis:

*   **Food Weighing:** All food intake has been weighed using a food scale since 2015.
*   **Dietary Tracking:** Daily food intake is entered into the Cronometer app.
*   **Data Export:** Cronometer data is exported into a spreadsheet.
*   **Correlation Calculation:** Each blood test result is aligned with the average dietary intake from the preceding period (e.g., 50 days prior to a blood test). This allows for the calculation of correlations between dietary components and biomarker levels.

## Key Finding: Zinc Correlation with Taurine

*   **Number of Comparisons (Test 10):** 91 comparisons were made between taurine levels and various foods, macronutrients, and micronutrients.
*   **Significantly Correlated Nutrient:** Only zinc was found to be significantly correlated with plasma taurine levels.
*   **Correlation Details:**
    *   **Correlation Coefficient (r):** 0.69
    *   **P-value:** < 0.05 (indicating statistical significance)
*   **Implication:** Higher average daily zinc intake is associated with higher plasma taurine levels.

### Dietary Zinc Intake Target

*   Based on the correlation, maintaining average daily zinc intake **greater than 14.5 mg/day** is suggested to keep taurine levels high.

### Testing the Zinc Correlation

*   **Post-Test 10 Zinc Intake:** 13.2 mg/day (for Test 11 analysis)
*   **Predicted Taurine at 13.2 mg/day Zinc (based on correlation):** Approximately 75 µmol/L
*   **Mechanism Hypothesis:** If zinc is causative in maintaining taurine levels, the correlation coefficient should remain strong (around 0.69) or strengthen as more data is collected. If zinc is not causative, the correlation is expected to weaken over time.

## Future Steps and Monitoring

*   **Ongoing Monitoring:** Correlation strength is continuously assessed after each blood test iteration.
*   **Test 11 Results:** The results for Test 11, including the correlation analysis with zinc, are available on Patreon.
*   **Test 12:** Blood was sent for Test 12 on September 6th, with results expected in October. An update video will be released subsequently.
*   **Optimization Strategy:** Increasing dietary zinc intake is a potential strategy to further elevate plasma taurine levels towards the target range of 130-140 µmol/L.
