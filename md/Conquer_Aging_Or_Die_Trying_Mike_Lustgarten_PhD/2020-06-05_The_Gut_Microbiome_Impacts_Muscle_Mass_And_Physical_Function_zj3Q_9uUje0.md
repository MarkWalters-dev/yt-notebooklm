# 2020-06-05 The Gut Microbiome Impacts Muscle Mass And Physical Function

## Executive Summary

*   The gut microbiome plays a significant role in maintaining muscle mass and physical function, as evidenced by studies comparing germ-free mice to those with a microbiome.
*   Specific gut bacteria, such as *Lactobacillus*, *Bifidobacterium*, and *Prevotella*, have been associated with increased muscle mass and strength.
*   Bacterial metabolites, particularly short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like acetate, propionate, and butyrate, are crucial for promoting muscle mass and function.
*   Conversely, certain gut bacteria-derived metabolites, such as indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate, can negatively impact muscle development and composition.
*   In humans, elite athletes exhibit distinct microbiome profiles and higher SCFA levels, while older adults with better physical function tend to have higher levels of SCFA-producing bacteria and lower levels of potentially detrimental bacteria.

## Gut Microbiome and Muscle Mass

### Animal Evidence

*   **Germ-Free vs. Microbiome-Containing Mice:**
    *   Germ-free mice (lacking a microbiome) exhibit lower muscle mass compared to mice with a microbiome. This difference persists even when muscle mass is normalized to body weight.
    *   Specific leg muscles (gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, quadriceps) showed reduced muscle weight to body weight ratio in germ-free mice.
    *   Colonizing germ-free mice with fecal samples from microbiome-containing mice led to an increase in muscle mass to body weight ratio, particularly in the gastrocnemius and quadriceps.

*   **Impact of Antibiotic Treatment:**
    *   Antibiotic treatment, which reduces gut bacterial content, results in a lower muscle mass to body weight ratio in mice.
    *   Reintroducing a normal microbiome in antibiotic-treated mice by exposing them to bedding and feces from untreated mice led to an increase in muscle mass.

*   **Specific Bacterial Species and Muscle Mass:**
    *   Supplementation with *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* in older mice increased muscle mass compared to untreated mice. *Bifidobacterium* specifically increased tibialis muscle mass.
    *   In a leukemia mouse model where muscle mass is reduced, supplementation with various *Lactobacillus* species led to an increase in tibialis muscle mass.

### Bacterial Metabolites and Muscle Mass

*   **Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs):**
    *   SCFAs, produced by bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber, are crucial for increasing muscle mass.
    *   Germ-free mice supplemented with a combination of acetate, propionate, and butyrate showed an increased gastrocnemius muscle weight to body weight ratio.
    *   In aged mice, butyrate supplementation significantly increased muscle mass to body weight ratio in the gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis anterior, and quadriceps muscles. This effect was not observed in young mice.

*   **Detrimental Metabolites:**
    *   **Indoxyl Sulfate:**
        *   This gut bacteria-derived metabolite is negatively associated with muscle development *in vitro*.
        *   Indoxyl sulfate reduces myoblast proliferation and causes myotube atrophy and shrinkage.
        *   In mice with reduced kidney function (simulating uremia), indoxyl sulfate administration led to decreased muscle mass in the tibialis anterior, soleus, and gastrocnemius. However, body weight was also reduced, making direct causation on muscle difficult to confirm *in vivo*.
    *   **p-Cresol Sulfate:**
        *   This uremic metabolite, also derived from the gut microbiome, negatively affects skeletal muscle composition.
        *   Mice injected with p-cresol sulfate showed increased lipid content within muscle tissue. This effect was comparable to the changes seen in a chronic kidney disease model.
        *   Increased intramuscular lipid content in older adults is associated with insulin resistance, reduced mobility, frailty, and increased mortality.

## Gut Microbiome and Physical Function

### Animal Evidence

*   **Germ-Free and Antibiotic-Treated Mice:**
    *   Germ-free mice exhibit reduced grip strength and swimming endurance capacity compared to microbiome-containing mice.
    *   Antibiotic treatment in mice negatively impacts treadmill endurance capacity.

*   **Specific Bacterial Species and Physical Function:**
    *   Supplementation with *Lactobacillus casei* or *Bifidobacterium longum* in older mice led to increases in grip strength.
    *   Colonizing germ-free mice with *Bacteroides fragilis* increased their swimming endurance capacity.
    *   Supplementation with *Eubacterium rectale* and *Clostridium coccoides* in germ-free mice resulted in higher swimming endurance capacity.
    *   Increased levels of *Veillonella atypica* in mice led to an increase in treadmill endurance capacity.

### Bacterial Metabolites and Physical Function

*   **Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs):**
    *   SCFAs improve muscle strength. Germ-free mice treated with SCFAs (acetate, propionate, butyrate) had higher grip strength compared to untreated germ-free mice.
    *   The combination of SCFAs may be more effective than individual ones; aged mice fed only butyrate for ten months did not show improved grip strength.
    *   Acetate and propionate improve treadmill endurance capacity.
        *   Acetate supplementation in antibiotic-treated mice improved treadmill endurance.
        *   Intra-rectal infusion of propionate increased treadmill time in mice.

## Human Evidence

*   **Elite Athletes:**
    *   Elite athletes possess a distinct gut microbiome and higher fecal SCFA levels (acetate, propionate, butyrate) compared to normal weight and obese individuals.

*   **Older Adults and Frailty:**
    *   Less frail older adults (around 88 years old) had higher levels of specific bacteria, including:
        *   *Bacteroides*
        *   *Prevotella* (known propionate producers)
        *   *Faecalibacterium prausnitzii* (known butyrate producers)
        *   *Lactobacillus/Enterococcus*
    *   Conversely, more frail older adults had higher levels of *Enterobacteria*, a finding replicated in other studies.
    *   Frailty assessment in these studies included mobility and physical fitness but was not specific to muscle mass or function.

*   **Author's Contributions: The Gut-Muscle Axis in Older Adults**
    *   **Serum Metabolomics:** A serum metabolomic approach identified metabolites exclusively or partly derived from gut bacteria that were associated with muscle mass, composition, and physical function in both young and older adults. Notably, indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate, which negatively impacted muscle in animal models, were also negatively associated with muscle-related outcomes in older adults.
    *   **High-Functioning vs. Low-Functioning Older Adults:**
        *   A study compared high-functioning (HF) and low-functioning (LF) older adults, primarily defined by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB).
        *   The HF group exhibited more favorable body composition (higher whole-body lean mass percentage, lower fat mass percentage) and better physical function (faster 400m walk, higher leg press 1RM).
        *   **Microbiome Differences:**
            *   The HF group had higher relative abundance of *Prevotellaceae*.
            *   The LF group had significantly higher relative abundance of *Enterobacteria* (approximately threefold more).
        *   **Longitudinal Study:** One month follow-up visits confirmed *Prevotella* to be higher in the HF group. While *Enterobacteria* trended higher in the LF group, the difference was not statistically significant, possibly due to sample size. Differences in genera (*Prevotella*, *Barnesiella*) and species (*Barnesiella intestinihominis*) were observed at both study visits.
    *   **Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) into Germ-Free Mice:**
        *   Fecal samples from HF and LF older adults were transplanted into germ-free mice.
        *   **Microbiome Overlap:** Similar differences in *Prevotellaceae*, *Barnesiella*, *Prevotella*, and *Barnesiella intestinihominis* were observed between human donors and their colonized mice.
        *   **Body Composition and Physical Function:** No significant differences in body weight or body composition were found in the colonized mice, despite substantial differences in the human donors.
        *   **Grip Strength:** The HF-colonized mice showed a small but significant increase in grip strength compared to LF-colonized mice. Treadmill endurance capacity did not show significant differences, with a trend towards better performance in LF-colonized mice.

## Diet and the Gut-Muscle Axis

*   **Dietary Fiber and SCFAs:**
    *   Dietary fiber is fermented by gut bacteria to produce SCFAs.
    *   **Soluble Fiber Supplementation:** A 13-week study involving soluble fiber (inulin and fructooligosaccharides) supplementation in older adults showed a ~20% increase in right-hand grip strength compared to a placebo group, which saw a decrease. The study did not assess microbiome or SCFA changes.
    *   **Fiber Density and Lean Mass (Unpublished Data):** Analysis of the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men's Study (MR. OS) revealed a significant positive association between dietary fiber density (grams of fiber per 100 calories) and the percentage of whole-body lean mass in older men.
    *   **High Fiber Density, High Lean Mass Group:** This group (highest tertile for fiber density and lean mass) had:
        *   Better body composition (higher lean mass, lower fat mass, lower BMI).
        *   Higher physical activity scores.
        *   Better physical function (higher SPPB scores, better grip strength).
        *   Higher intake of dietary fiber and fiber density.
    *   **Microbiome and Function in High Fiber Group:**
        *   Higher relative abundance of *Ruminococcus* and lower abundance of *Parabacteroides*.
        *   Higher relative abundance of *Clostridium* and *Lachnospira* (known butyrate-producing bacteria).
        *   Genes involved in butyrate production were higher in this group.
    *   **Future Research:** The author proposes that high soluble fiber dietary interventions from whole foods, rather than supplements, may positively impact the gut-muscle axis, potentially through SCFAs.
