# 2020-07-21 Blood testing for Blood Urea Nitrogen BUN - What's optimal

## Executive Summary

*   Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) levels increase with age, from approximately 11-13 mg/dL in 20-year-olds to 20-23 mg/dL in 90-year-olds.
*   BUN levels below 15 mg/dL are associated with the maximally reduced risk of all-cause mortality.
*   BUN levels above 15 mg/dL, even within the standard reference range, are associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality.
*   Dietary nitrogen intake, primarily from protein (amino acids), directly correlates with urea production and, consequently, BUN levels in individuals with normal kidney function.
*   Personal data indicates a strong correlation (r=0.78) between daily average protein intake and BUN levels, with protein intake explaining 60% of the variability in BUN.

## Understanding Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)

Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) is a test that measures the amount of urea in the blood. Urea is a metabolite produced during the breakdown of proteins.

## BUN Levels and Aging

*   In youth (around 20 years old), BUN levels are lower:
    *   Women: approximately 11 mg/dL
    *   Men: approximately 13 mg/dL
*   During aging, BUN levels gradually increase.
*   By 90 years old, average BUN values can range from 20 to 23 mg/dL.

## BUN and All-Cause Mortality Risk

A study of approximately 31,000 subjects investigated the association between BUN levels and all-cause mortality risk.

*   The standard reference range for BUN is 7 to 20 mg/dL.
*   **Key Finding:** BUN levels **less than 15 mg/dL** are associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality.
*   Compared to a BUN of 15 mg/dL, a BUN of 20 mg/dL (at the high end of the reference range) is associated with approximately a **40% increased risk** for all-cause mortality.
*   Considering both aging data and mortality risk data, values **less than 15 mg/dL** appear to be optimal for health, rather than the standard reference range of 7-20 mg/dL.

## Malleability of BUN: The Role of Diet

BUN levels can be influenced by dietary intake, particularly nitrogen.

*   **Nitrogen Intake vs. Urea Production:** There is a strong, nearly linear correlation (r=0.98) between higher dietary nitrogen intake and higher urea production.
*   **Source of Dietary Nitrogen:** Dietary nitrogen comes almost exclusively from amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein.
    *   Therefore, a high protein intake leads to a high content of dietary nitrogen.
    *   This, in turn, is expected to increase urea production and, consequently, BUN levels, assuming normal kidney function.
*   **Exclusion of Other Macronutrients:**
    *   Essential fatty acids do not contain nitrogen in their chemical structure.
    *   Sugars (glucose, galactose, fructose) also do not contain nitrogen.

## Personal Data: Protein Intake and BUN Correlation

The speaker's personal data, collected over five years and 25 blood tests, demonstrates the relationship between protein intake and BUN levels.

*   **Methodology:**
    *   Blood tests conducted 4-6 times per year.
    *   Daily diet tracked, including weighing food.
    *   Food logging in an app for macro- and micronutrient content.
    *   Data logged into an Excel file for correlation analysis.
*   **Findings:**
    *   A strong correlation (r=0.78) was observed between daily average protein intake and BUN levels.
    *   A red dotted trend line illustrates that as protein intake increases, BUN levels also increase.
    *   Protein intake explains **60%** of the variability in the speaker's BUN levels. This is a statistically significant correlation.

## Conclusion on Optimal BUN

Based on the presented evidence:

*   BUN levels are lower in youth and increase with age.
*   BUN levels below 15 mg/dL are associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk.
*   Dietary protein intake is a significant determinant of BUN levels.
*   The speaker monitors protein intake to maintain BUN levels **below 15 mg/dL**.
