# 2021-10-23 Fasting Drives The Geroprotective Effects Of A Calorie-Restricted Diet

### Executive Summary
*   Fasting is crucial for the metabolic, molecular, and geroprotective benefits of calorie restriction (CR) in male C57BL/6J mice.
*   Mice on a 30% CR diet combined with daily 22-hour fasting (one meal a day, OMAD) exhibited the longest average lifespan and lowest frailty index.
*   Conversely, mice on a 30% CR diet without prolonged fasting (eating diluted food throughout the day) had a *shorter* average lifespan than both the CR+fasting group and ad libitum-fed mice.
*   CR with prolonged fasting improved insulin sensitivity, while CR without prolonged fasting demonstrated superior glucose tolerance but inferior insulin sensitivity compared to the fasting CR group.

Fasting drives the metabolic, molecular, and general protective effects of a calorie-restricted diet in mice.

## Study Methodology
The study started with four-month-old male mice, divided into three groups:

*   **Ad Libitum (Ad Lib) Group:** Mice had free access to food, eating as much as they wanted whenever they wanted.
*   **Classical Calorie Restriction (CR) Group:** Mice consumed 30% fewer calories daily compared to the Ad Lib group. They consumed their daily allowance within the first two hours after food provision, resulting in an approximately 22-hour daily fast (one meal a day, OMAD).
*   **Diluted Ad Lib Group:** The diet was diluted with cellulose to reduce overall calorie density, resulting in a 30% calorie restriction equivalent to the classical CR group. However, these mice had free access to this diluted food and could eat as much as they wanted, whenever they wanted, thereby eliminating the prolonged daily fasting period.

Food consumption data confirmed that Ad Lib mice consumed approximately 12 kilocalories per day, while both the classical CR and diluted Ad Lib groups consumed about 8.5 kilocalories per day, representing a 30% calorie restriction for these two groups. Each group spent thirteen months on their respective diets.

## Body Composition
Ad Libitum-fed mice displayed the highest body weight, with age-related increases in body weight, lean mass, and fat mass, leading to a higher body fat percentage at the end of the study period.

In the classical CR group (30% CR with 22-hour fasting), body weight was significantly lower and more stable compared to the Ad Lib group. These mice maintained stable whole-body lean mass, experienced a small but significant increase in fat mass over time, and achieved about half the body fat percentage of Ad Lib-fed mice after 510 days.

The diluted Ad Lib group (30% CR without prolonged fasting) showed lower body weight, lean mass (starting at 9 months of age), fat mass, and overall body fat percentage compared to the classical CR group (30% CR with 22-hour fasting). This suggests that calorie restriction without fasting may be better for overall body composition than calorie restriction with a prolonged fast.

## Metabolic Effects
To assess the health implications of CR with and without fasting, the study examined glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity.

A glucose tolerance test (GTT), measuring the disappearance of blood glucose after infusion, revealed that the diluted Ad Lib group (30% CR without fasting) exhibited the greatest glucose tolerance. This group's ability to remove glucose from the blood was superior to both the classical CR group (30% CR with 22-hour fasting) and the Ad Lib group. While classical CR mice showed better glucose tolerance than Ad Lib mice, their glucose tolerance was not as pronounced as that of the diluted Ad Lib group. This suggests that 30% CR with less fasting may be better for glucose tolerance than CR plus an all-day fast.

Conversely, an insulin tolerance test (ITT), which assesses insulin sensitivity by measuring glucose disappearance after insulin injection, showed that the classical CR group (30% CR with 22-hour fasting) had the best insulin sensitivity among all groups. The diluted Ad Lib group (30% CR without prolonged fasting) did not show a significant difference in insulin sensitivity compared to the Ad Lib group. This suggests that an all-day fast plus 30% CR is better for insulin sensitivity than not fasting all day for the same amount of calories.

## Frailty
To evaluate physiological function, the study assessed frailty using a Frailty Index (FI) that included six specific measures: body condition, overall grip strength, kyphosis (spinal curvature), abdominal distension, coat condition, and loss of fur color. An overall frailty score based on 25 measures was also calculated.

Aged mice in the classical CR group (30% CR with 22-hour fasting) demonstrated lower frailty across most individual measures compared to Ad Libitum-fed mice, specifically in body condition, grip strength, coat condition, and loss of fur color.

Comparing the two CR groups, there was no significant difference in frailty for body condition, grip strength, or abdominal distension. However, the diluted Ad Lib group (30% CR without prolonged fasting) exhibited worse kyphosis, worse coat condition, and greater loss of fur color compared to the classical CR group (30% CR with 22-hour fasting).

Analyzing the total frailty score (25 measures), the classical CR group (30% CR with 22-hour fasting) showed the lowest overall frailty. Notably, the diluted Ad Lib group (30% CR without prolonged fasting) had a total frailty score comparable to that of the Ad Libitum-fed mice, indicating no benefit in overall frailty reduction despite calorie restriction. This suggests that CR plus an all-day fast is better for limiting frailty during aging when compared with the same amount of calories but not fasting.

## Lifespan
Compared to Ad Libitum-fed mice, the classical CR group (30% CR with 22-hour fasting) exhibited the longest average lifespan. Strikingly, the diluted Ad Lib group (30% CR without prolonged fasting) had the *shortest* average lifespan among all three groups, including the Ad Libitum-fed mice. This indicates that eliminating the fasting period, even under calorie restriction, severely curtailed lifespan.

This strongly suggests that prolonged daily fasting is essential for the lifespan-extending benefits of calorie restriction, and its absence can even shorten lifespan compared to ad libitum feeding.

In sum, fasting is required for CR-induced improvements in frailty and lifespan in male C57BL/6J mice.
