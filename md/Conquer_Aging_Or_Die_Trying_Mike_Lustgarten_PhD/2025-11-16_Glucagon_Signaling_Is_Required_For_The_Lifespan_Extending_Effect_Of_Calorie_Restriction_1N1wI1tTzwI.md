# 2025-11-16 Glucagon Signaling Is Required For The Lifespan Extending Effect Of Calorie Restriction

## Executive Summary

*   Calorie restriction (CR) extends average and maximal lifespan, a benefit partly attributed to lower blood glucose and insulin levels.
*   Calorie-restricted mice exhibit prolonged daily fasting periods of 21-22 hours, suggesting a role for the fasted state in CR's effects.
*   During fasting, declining blood glucose stimulates pancreatic alpha cells to release glucagon, which signals the liver to release stored glucose, maintaining blood glucose homeostasis.
*   Experimental data demonstrates that glucagon signaling is essential for the lifespan-extending effects of calorie restriction, as glucagon receptor knockout mice on a CR diet did not show increased survival.
*   This indicates that glucagon's role in the fasted state, rather than just calorie reduction, is a critical component of how calorie restriction extends lifespan.

## Glucose and Insulin Regulation

In the fed state or after eating, blood glucose levels increase, stimulating pancreatic beta cells to release insulin. Rising blood insulin acts as a signal on target tissues, including the liver, fat, and muscle, to take up glucose from the blood. This reduces blood glucose levels, maintaining glucose within a normal homeostatic range.

The importance of glucose and insulin during aging is illustrated by the finding that calorie-restricted animals have lower levels of glucose and insulin throughout their lifespan. This is thought to be one reason why calorie-restricted animals live longer, experiencing significant increases in average and maximal lifespan.

**Fed State Metabolic Pathway:**
Increased Blood Glucose -> Pancreatic Beta Cells -> Release Insulin -> Insulin acts on Liver, Fat, Muscle -> Take up Glucose from Blood -> Reduce Blood Glucose -> Maintain Homeostasis

## Fasting and Glucagon

The benefits of calorie restriction may involve more than just glucose and insulin regulation in the fed state, with fasting playing a significant role. Calorie-restricted mice, for instance, consume nearly all their food within a very short window, leading to daily fasting periods of up to 21 to 22 hours.

During prolonged fasting, blood glucose levels decline. This decline acts as a signal on pancreatic alpha cells to release glucagon. Rising glucagon levels in the blood then signal the liver to break down stored glycogen, converting it into glucose, which is subsequently released into the blood. This process helps maintain blood glucose levels within the normal homeostatic range during fasting.

**Fasting State Metabolic Pathway:**
Prolonged Fasting -> Decline Blood Glucose -> Pancreatic Alpha Cells -> Release Glucagon -> Glucagon acts on Liver -> Break down Stored Glycogen -> Convert to Glucose -> Release into Blood -> Maintain Homeostasis

## Experimental Evidence: Glucagon Signaling and Lifespan

Glucagon signaling is required for the lifespan-extending effect of calorie restriction. Data from a recently published study supports this:

The study compared survival curves for different groups of mice. At the 50% survival time point, half of the calorie-restricted, glucagon receptor knockout mice (GCGR KO CR) had died. These mice were calorie restricted but lacked functional glucagon receptors in all tissues, meaning there was no intracellular glucagon signaling. In contrast, all calorie-restricted mice with functional glucagon receptors were still alive at this same time point.

These findings strongly indicate that glucagon signaling is required or essential for the lifespan-extending effect of calorie restriction.

## Translational Implications

Considering that calorie-restricted mice fast for the majority of the day (21-22 hours) and prolonged intraday fasting can increase blood levels of glucagon, a critical question arises: Will calorie restriction combined with fasting maximize lifespan in people?

This suggests that merely being calorie restricted might not be sufficient for the full average and maximal lifespan-extending effects observed with calorie restriction. Fasting, and its impact on glucagon signaling, may be a significant component of this equation.
