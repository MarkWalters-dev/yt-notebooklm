# 2024-11-27 Optimizing Glutathione s Component Amino Acids Without Supplements

## Executive Summary

*   Glutathione (GSH) levels decline with age, with studies showing decreases of 15% to 50%.
*   The amino acid components of glutathione, cysteine and glycine, show age-related declines in plasma levels, though glutamate levels appear stable.
*   Personal data suggests increased plasma levels of glycine, cysteine, and glutamate in 2024 compared to 2023, without intentional supplementation of these amino acids.
*   Higher intake of fiber and iron are significantly correlated with higher plasma levels of glycine, cysteine, and glutamate, even after accounting for protein and calorie intake.
*   Increased calorie intake is negatively correlated with plasma levels of all three amino acid components of glutathione.

## Glutathione Decline with Age

Glutathione (GSH) levels have been observed to decline with age across multiple studies. The magnitude of this decline varies, with observed reductions of:
*   50% in one study.
*   15% in a second study.
*   33% in a third study.

## Glutathione Synthesis and Amino Acid Components

Glutathione is a tripeptide composed of three amino acids: glutamate, cysteine, and glycine. The decline in glutathione levels with age raises the question of whether the levels of these constituent amino acids also decline.

## Age-Related Changes in Amino Acid Plasma Levels

### Study 1: Younger (40 years old) vs. Older (70 years old) Adults (Small Sample Size: 8 subjects per group)

*   **Glycine:** Plasma levels were significantly lower in older adults (218 micromolar) compared to younger adults (487 micromolar).
*   **Cysteine:** Plasma levels were also lower in older adults (approximately 20 micromolar) compared to younger adults (26.2 micromolar).
*   **Glutamate:** Plasma levels did not differ between the younger and older adult groups.
*   **Weakness:** This study had a small sample size (8 subjects per group), limiting its generalizability.

### Study 2: Young Adults (Average age 30, n=20) vs. Older Adults (Average age 66, n=120) (Larger Sample Size)

*   **Glycine:** Plasma levels were lower in older adults.
*   **Cysteine:** Plasma levels were *higher* in older adults compared to younger adults. This finding is inconsistent with Study 1.
*   **Glutamate:** Data not detailed in this section, but the speaker notes difficulty finding large studies on glutamate.

**Inconsistency:** The data for cysteine levels between the two studies is inconsistent, highlighting the need for larger sample sizes and further investigation.

## Personal Metabolomic Data (2023 vs. 2024)

The speaker tracked their own plasma levels of glycine, cysteine, and glutamate using at-home metabolomic testing.

### Glycine Levels

*   **2023 (5 tests):** Average plasma glycine: 283 micromolar.
*   **2024 (7 tests):** Average plasma glycine: 518 micromolar.
*   **Statistical Analysis:** A two-sample t-test showed that 2024 levels were significantly higher than 2023 levels (p = 0.02).

### Cysteine Levels

*   **2023 (5 tests):** Average plasma cysteine: 11 micromolar.
*   **2024 (7 tests):** Average plasma cysteine: 30 micromolar.
*   **Statistical Analysis:** A two-sample t-test indicated significantly higher levels in 2024 compared to 2023.

### Glutamate Levels

*   **2023 (5 tests):** Average plasma glutamate: 129 micromolar.
*   **2024 (7 tests):** Average plasma glutamate: 214 micromolar.
*   **Statistical Analysis:** A significant increase in glutamate levels was observed in 2024 compared to 2023.

**Key Observation:** These increases in amino acid levels occurred *without* direct supplementation of these amino acids.

## Investigating Dietary Factors

The observed increases in amino acid levels prompted an investigation into potential dietary influences.

### Protein Intake

*   **2023 Average Daily Protein Intake:** 98 grams per day.
*   **2024 Average Daily Protein Intake:** Slightly higher than 2023 (just outside statistical significance, but close).
*   **Analysis:** A 6-gram per day average increase in protein intake is unlikely to fully explain the near doubling or tripling of plasma amino acid levels.

### Correlation Analysis (12 Test Data)

A comprehensive correlation analysis was performed between 86 dietary factors (macronutrients, micronutrients, and foods) and plasma levels of glycine, cysteine, and glutamate. To account for potential false positives due to the large number of comparisons, a different approach focusing on overlapping associations across all three amino acids was used.

**Common Positive Correlations (Higher Intake Associated with Higher Amino Acid Levels):**
*   Oranges
*   Iron intake
*   Fiber intake

**Common Negative Correlations (Higher Intake Associated with Lower Amino Acid Levels):**
*   Sodium
*   Oats
*   Barley
*   Low-fat yogurt
*   Parmesan cheese
*   Calories

### Impact of Protein and Calorie Intake on Correlations

Linear regression models were used to assess if the identified correlations remained significant after adjusting for protein and calorie intake.

#### Fiber Intake

*   **Finding:** After adjusting for calorie and protein intake, fiber intake remained significantly positively associated with plasma levels of glycine, cysteine, and glutamate.
*   **Actionable Insight:** The speaker aims for the higher end of their fiber intake range (89 grams per day) to potentially support higher amino acid levels.

#### Iron Intake

*   **Finding:** Iron intake remained significantly associated with glycine, cysteine, and glutamate after adjusting for calorie and protein intake.
*   **Actionable Insight:** The speaker aims for the higher end of their iron intake range (34 milligrams per day) to potentially support higher amino acid levels.

#### Other Overlapping Associations

*   **Oranges:** Not significantly associated with glycine after adjustment.
*   **Barley:** Not significantly associated with glycine after adjustment.
*   **Oats:** Still associated with glycine and cysteine, but not significantly with glutamate after adjustment.
*   **Vanilla Beans:** (Correction: Likely intended to be Barley based on context) Not significantly associated.
*   **Parmesan Cheese:** Not significantly associated with glycine after adjustment.

**Important Note:** Correlation does not imply causation. These findings suggest associations, and further experimental validation would be needed to confirm causal relationships.

## Holistic Approach to Biomarker Optimization

The speaker emphasizes that the goal is not solely to optimize the levels of these three amino acids. Instead, the focus is on the *net effect* of dietary choices on a multitude of biomarkers representing various organ systems and metabolic health. The aim is to optimize as many biomarkers as possible, not just a select few.
