# 2024-01-28 Blood Test 1 in 2024 - What's My Biological Age

## Executive Summary

*   **Biological Age:** The most recent blood test indicates a biological age of 34.3 years, which is 16.7 years younger than the chronological age. This suggests a slowing of age-related biological processes as measured by Dr. Morgan Levine's Phenotypic Age Calculator.
*   **HDL Improvement:** HDL cholesterol levels have shown consistent improvement, reaching or exceeding 50 mg/dL for the past six consecutive tests, a positive indicator for reduced all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Creatinine Trend:** While the current creatinine level of 0.91 mg/dL represents progress, the preceding five tests showed an upward trend (1.01 mg/dL), contrasting with the overall age-related increase in creatinine.
*   **Albumin Levels:** Albumin levels are at 4.9 g/dL, which is considered youthful and potentially indicative of longevity, as albumin declines with aging. The age-expected value for a 51-year-old is 4.3 g/dL.
*   **ALT Fluctuation:** Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) has recently trended upwards, averaging 25.3 units/L over the last 10 tests, compared to 23 units/L for the preceding 10 tests. This increase is concerning due to the U-shaped association between ALT and all-cause mortality risk.

## Biological Age Assessment

The latest blood test, conducted on January 28, 2024, yielded a biological age of 34.3 years using Dr. Morgan Levine's Phenotypic Age Calculator. This result indicates a biological age 16.7 years younger than the chronological age.

**Historical Phenotypic Age (Biological Age) Trends:**

*   **2018-2019:** Average PhenoAge of 36.1 years (based on 3 tests).
*   **2020-2021:** Average PhenoAge of 35.6 years (based on 12 tests, including hs-CRP).
*   **2022:** Average PhenoAge of 33.8 years (based on 7 tests).
*   **2023:** Average PhenoAge of 34.7 years (based on 7 tests).
*   **2024 (current test):** 34.3 years.

**Age-Related Increase Resistance:**
The expected increase in PhenoAge is 0.9 years per chronological year. If all biomarkers remained constant since 2020, the current biological age would be approximately 38.6 years. The observed range of 33.8 to 34.7 years suggests an effective resistance to age-related increases in biological age.

*Note: High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) measurement was below the limit of detection (<0.3 mg/L) for the 15th consecutive test, potentially indicating an even lower actual value.*

## Key Biomarker Analysis

### Cardiovascular Health Indicators

*   **HDL Cholesterol:**
    *   For six consecutive tests, HDL has been ≥ 50 mg/dL.
    *   HDL in the 50-60 mg/dL range is associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk.
    *   Prior to these six tests, the 43-test average since 2015 was approximately 45 mg/dL, indicating recent improvement.

*   **Triglycerides:**
    *   Current level: 63 mg/dL.
    *   Levels less than 90 mg/dL are associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality.
    *   Lowest coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality risk is observed at triglyceride levels of 40 mg/dL or less.
    *   Hazard ratio for CHD mortality risk increases linearly above 40 mg/dL.

### Inflammation Markers

*   **High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP):**
    *   Current measurement is <0.3 mg/L (limit of detection).

### Kidney Function Indicators

*   **Creatinine:**
    *   Current level: 0.91 mg/dL.
    *   The previous five tests showed an upward trend to 1.01 mg/dL.
    *   The average of the 43 tests prior to the recent trend was 0.95 mg/dL.
    *   An increase in creatinine is associated with aging. The current level of 0.91 mg/dL represents progress in moving away from its age-related increase.
    *   *Note: Due to wide variability in creatinine levels above 40 years of age, it may not be the most accurate marker for kidney function in this age group.*

*   **Cystatin C:** (Data to be covered in a future video).

### Liver and Protein Markers

*   **Albumin:**
    *   Current level: 4.9 g/dL.
    *   Albumin levels decline with aging.
    *   Age-expected value for a 51-year-old is approximately 4.3 g/dL.
    *   Current levels are considered youthful and potentially important for longevity.
    *   Centenarians have average albumin levels around 3.6 g/dL.

*   **Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT):**
    *   Current level: 28 units/L.
    *   ALT exhibits a U-shaped association with all-cause mortality risk.
    *   Median ALT values between 18-22 units/L are associated with significantly lower risk of death.
    *   Levels around 28-29 units/L are associated with higher risk.
    *   **Recent Trend:**
        *   Last 10 tests average: 25.3 units/L.
        *   10 tests prior to that average: 23 units/L.
    *   This upward trend indicates a need for improvement.

### Red Blood Cell Parameters

*   **Red Blood Cells (RBC):**
    *   Current count: 4.53 million/µL (near the lowest observed over many tests).
    *   RBCs decline during aging.

*   **Hemoglobin:**
    *   Current level: Less than 14.9 mg/dL (first time in 28 tests).
    *   Hemoglobin, found in RBCs, also declines during aging.
    *   The usual level is around 15 mg/dL.

*   **Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV):**
    *   MCV, representing average red blood cell size, has been increasing for a few tests.
    *   MCV increases during aging, indicating a need to revert to smaller red blood cell size.

## Emerging Biomarkers and Future Monitoring

### Neutrophils

*   **Current level:** 1,788 cells/µL.
*   While within the typical reference range, data suggests that neutrophil counts between 2,000-3,000 cells/µL are associated with the lowest risk for all-cause mortality.
*   Levels below 2,000 cells/µL are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   Average neutrophil levels over the last few tests are around 2,000 cells/µL.
*   *Note: Neutrophils can be an indicator of a pro-inflammatory state. The current focus is on monitoring rather than active intervention to lower them, avoiding levels below 2,000.*
