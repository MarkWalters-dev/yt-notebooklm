# 2021-01-06 Quantifying Biological Age - Blood Test 6 in 2020

## Executive Summary

*   The speaker maintained a biological age consistently younger than his chronological age (47) in 2020, averaging 35.2 years based on Morgan Levine's phenotypic age calculator.
*   A mild 4.3% reduction in daily calorie intake from 2019 to 2020 was associated with stable year-over-year biological age, aligning with observations from calorie restriction studies.
*   Cardiovascular health metrics, including resting heart rate and heart rate variability, remained stable from 2019 to 2020, likely contributing to the consistent biological age.
*   Precision nutrition analysis identified a strong positive correlation (0.85) between simple carbohydrate intake (non-fiber, non-fructose) and higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, an inflammatory biomarker.
*   An inverse correlation suggested that higher total fat, particularly saturated fat from coconut butter, was associated with lower CRP levels. However, reducing simple sugars to lower CRP could have complex, potentially undesirable, effects on other biomarkers like glucose, creatinine, and white blood cells, though these correlations were weaker.

## Personal Biological Age Trends

The speaker's biological age, calculated using Morgan Levine's phenotypic age calculator, was 33.8 years based on the sixth blood test in 2020. With a chronological age of 47, this indicates a biological age over 13 years younger than chronological age.

Across the first five blood tests in 2020, biological age ranged from 33 to 39 years. The measurement of 39 years coincided with a period of decreased fat intake and increased carbohydrate intake, which may be related to the increase.

The average biological age in 2020 over six tests was 35.2 years, 11.8 years younger than chronological age.

Comparing this to 2019, where two measurements were taken (37.3 and 33.09 years), the average biological age for 2019 was also 35.2 years. This suggests that over one chronological year, there was zero years of biological aging based on these two data points. While acknowledging that more data would be needed for a definitive conclusion, the stability of biological age is considered encouraging.

## Calorie Restriction and Biological Age

A study on calorie restriction (CR) investigated its impact on biological age, using a calculator derived from clinical blood biomarkers. The study compared an Ad Lib (normal diet) group with a CR group over 12 and 24 months.

*   **Baseline:** No significant difference in biological age between Ad Lib and CR groups.
*   **After 1 year:**
    *   The Ad Lib group showed an increase in biological age of 0.7 years (one chronological year passed, 0.7 years of biological aging).
    *   The CR group (14.5% calorie restriction) showed only a 0.1-year increase in biological age. The confidence interval indicated that some individuals on CR might have experienced zero biological aging.

This outcome for the CR group is similar to the speaker's personal data, where biological age remained approximately stable year-over-year.

## Personal Calorie Intake Analysis

To investigate if calorie restriction played a role in the speaker's stable biological age, daily calorie intake was analyzed for 2019 and 2020.

**Personal Data Tracking Methodology:**
*   All food is weighed daily using a food scale (since April 2015).
*   Macros and micros are tracked.
*   Actual food intake is tracked in addition to macros/micros.

*   **2019 Average Daily Calorie Intake:** 2,703 calories/day.
*   **2020 Average Daily Calorie Intake:** 2,587 calories/day.

Statistical analysis (t-test) revealed a small but significant reduction in calorie intake from 2019 to 2020 (4.3%, p=0.003). This represents a very mild calorie restriction.

The speaker suggests that a relatively small calorie restriction (e.g., 4.3%) may be sufficient to slow or stop year-to-year biological aging, as opposed to the ~14% reduction seen in the clinical CR study. However, many other variables may also impact biological age.

## Cardiovascular Fitness Metrics

Two cardiovascular health metrics, resting heart rate (RHR) and heart rate variability (HRV), were tracked to assess potential fitness improvements.

*   **Resting Heart Rate (RHR):**
    *   **2019 Average:** 48.8 beats per minute (BPM).
    *   **2020 Average:** 48.1 BPM (a slight, statistically significant reduction). While a lower RHR is generally desirable, RHR can also decrease with aging, potentially indicating a weaker heart.
*   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):**
    *   **2019 Average:** Approximately 56.
    *   **2020 Average:** Approximately 58 (a slight increase).
    *   This increase was not statistically significant (p=0.07). HRV typically decreases with aging, so an increase or stable HRV, combined with a slightly reduced RHR, suggests that cardiovascular health metrics did not worsen and likely remained approximately the same from 2019 to 2020.

The speaker posits that maintaining cardiovascular health (stable RHR and HRV) at similar levels from 2019 to 2020 is a contributing factor to the observed stability in biological age.

## Precision Nutrition and C-Reactive Protein (CRP)

The speaker's focus on "precision nutrition" aims to identify specific dietary patterns within a whole-food diet that optimize health metrics and minimize disease risk. C-reactive protein (CRP) is used as an example biomarker, where lower levels are considered better.

*   **2020 CRP Range:** 0.3 to 1.01 milligrams per liter (over six measurements).
*   **Goal:** Consistently achieve CRP levels closer to 0.3, avoiding higher measurements like 0.84 and 0.53.

## Dietary Component Correlations with CRP

The speaker analyzed correlations between various dietary components and CRP levels based on their personal data (approximately 12 CRP measurements).

### Carbohydrates and CRP

*   **Total Calories & Total Carbohydrates:** CRP was not significantly correlated with total calorie or total carbohydrate intake.
*   **Carbohydrate Subtypes:** Carbohydrates include fiber (polysaccharides), starch (disaccharides), and simple sugars (monosaccharides). These can have different impacts on CRP.
    *   **Fiber:** Not significantly associated with CRP.
    *   **Total Fructose Intake:** Not significantly associated with CRP.
    *   **Remaining Carbohydrates (Simple Sugars/Disaccharides):** A strong positive correlation was observed between higher simple carbohydrate intake (carbohydrates minus fiber and fructose) and higher CRP levels. The correlation coefficient was 0.85. This suggests that reducing simple sugar/disaccharide intake (even from whole foods) could lead to lower CRP.

### Fats and CRP

*   **Protein:** Not significantly correlated with CRP.
*   **Total Fat Intake:** A significant inverse correlation was observed: higher fat intake correlated with lower CRP. Extrapolation suggests aiming for around 110 grams of fat per day for lower CRP.
*   **Fat Subtypes:** All fats are not the same (monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) including Omega-3 and Omega-6, and saturated fatty acids (SFA)).
    *   **MUFA:** Not significantly correlated with CRP.
    *   **Omega-3 & Omega-6:** Not significantly correlated with CRP.
    *   **Saturated Fatty Acids (SFA):** Showed a correlation with CRP close to statistical significance (p=0.05), suggesting SFA intake might be a driver of the inverse correlation seen with total fat.
*   **Saturated Fat Sources:**
    *   **Cocoa Beans (main source of long-chain SFA):** No significant correlation with CRP.
    *   **Full-Fat Yogurt (main source of long-chain SFA):** No significant correlation with CRP.
    *   **Coconut Butter (main source of medium-chain SFA):** Showed a correlation with CRP that was close to statistical significance and in the same direction as total SFA and total fat (higher coconut butter intake correlated with lower CRP). This suggests that maintaining coconut butter intake around 50 grams per day might contribute to consistently low CRP levels.

## Impact on Other Biological Age Biomarkers

The speaker recognizes the need to assess if these dietary changes (e.g., cutting simple carbs, increasing coconut butter) affect other biomarkers used in Levine's biological age calculator, as negative impacts on other markers could negate CRP improvements.

*   **Coconut Butter (CB) Correlations:** No significant correlations were found between increased coconut butter intake and any of the other eight biomarkers on the calculator. This suggests that increasing coconut butter might reduce CRP without negatively impacting other biomarkers. However, Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) showed a correlation with CB that was close to significance (p > 0.05 but near the threshold). If RDW increases with CB intake, further interventions might be needed to keep RDW low.
*   **Simple Sugar Intake Correlations:** Lower simple sugar intake was correlated with lower CRP, which is desirable. However, higher simple sugar intake was also correlated with:
    *   Lower glucose (desirable)
    *   Lower creatinine (desirable)
    *   Lower white blood cells (desirable)
    *   Conversely, cutting simple sugar intake might lead to increases in glucose, creatinine, and white blood cells, which would be undesirable in terms of aging and disease risk.
    *   Additionally, cutting simple sugar intake would likely lead to lower Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) levels, as there is a positive correlation between MCV and simple sugar intake.
*   **Correlation Strength:** The correlations for simple sugar intake with glucose, creatinine, white blood cells, and MCV were moderate or weak (correlation coefficients less than 0.5 or negative 0.5). In contrast, the correlation for simple sugar intake with CRP was very strong (0.85). The speaker hypothesizes that by keeping simple sugar intake low, CRP will remain low due to the strong correlation, and the other biomarkers (glucose, creatinine, white blood cells, MCV) might not be significantly affected due to their weaker correlations.
