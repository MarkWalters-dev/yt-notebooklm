# 2020-08-15 Low Total Cholesterol - Biological Youth Or Increased Mortality Risk

## Executive Summary

*   Total cholesterol (TC) levels, particularly in the 160 mg/dL range, are observed in both youth and individuals attaining extreme old age (supercentenarians).
*   For individuals aged 75-99, the lowest all-cause mortality risk is associated with TC levels between 210-240 mg/dL. TC levels in the 160 mg/dL range show a significantly increased mortality risk for this age group.
*   However, for individuals with low TC (<160 mg/dL), concurrently high levels of albumin (greater than 38 g/L) and high HDL (greater than 47 mg/dL) are associated with a significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk.
*   This suggests that low TC, when coupled with favorable albumin and HDL profiles, may be indicative of biological youth rather than an increased mortality risk in certain populations.

## Personal Total Cholesterol Trends

Personal total cholesterol values were tracked over fifteen years, with 36 measurements taken. The values ranged from a low of 114 mg/dL to a high of 185 mg/dL, with an average of 144 mg/dL.

Lower levels of total cholesterol are characteristic of youth, with average values around 170 mg/dL for women and 160 mg/dL for men. However, cholesterol levels also decline towards the end of life, continuing to decrease past 88 years of age, including in centenarians, semi-centenarians, and supercentenarians. Population data for total cholesterol shows approximately 201 mg/dL for ages 85-99, declining further to 172, 165, and 156 mg/dL in increasingly older age groups. Thus, total cholesterol values in the 160 mg/dL range are observed in both youth and individuals achieving super longevity.

## Total Cholesterol and All-Cause Mortality Risk

### Mortality Risk in Older Adults

Data indicates that low total cholesterol levels in advanced age are generally detrimental to health. For individuals aged 75-99, the lowest risk of death from all causes is found with total cholesterol levels in the 210-240 mg/dL range. Cholesterol levels around 160 mg/dL, as seen in centenarians, are associated with a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality.

### Personal Risk Assessment

Based on chronological age and an average total cholesterol of 144 mg/dL over the past fifteen years, personal values fall below the optimal range for the current age group (210-240 mg/dL). This suggests an increased risk of all-cause mortality by at least 40% when compared to individuals with optimal cholesterol levels. This presents a paradox: are these low levels indicative of biological youth or an increased mortality risk?

## Modulating Factors for Low Total Cholesterol Mortality Risk

### The Role of Albumin and HDL

Studies have shown that individuals with low total cholesterol (less than 160 mg/dL) can achieve a similar survival rate to those with higher total cholesterol if they concurrently have high levels of albumin and HDL. A study on subjects around 79 years old tracked survival for up to six years. It found that subjects with low total cholesterol, but relatively high albumin and HDL levels, demonstrated similar survival compared to groups with higher total cholesterol (161-239 mg/dL and greater than 240 mg/dL). This outcome aligns with the observation that higher levels of albumin and HDL are also found in youth, suggesting that this combination might indicate biological youth.

### Key Thresholds for Reduced Risk

Further analysis of subjects with total cholesterol levels less than 160 mg/dL revealed specific modulating factors for all-cause mortality risk:

*   **Highest Risk:** Low total cholesterol, low albumin, and either low or high HDL.
*   **Decreased Risk:** Risk begins to decrease with higher albumin. High albumin but low HDL is associated with a 32% reduced risk of all-cause mortality compared to the highest risk group.
*   **Maximally Reduced Risk:** For subjects with total cholesterol less than 160 mg/dL, the lowest all-cause mortality risk is observed when:
    *   Albumin is greater than 38 grams per liter (g/L)
    *   HDL is greater than 47 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL)

### Personal Albumin and HDL Levels

Over 25 blood tests in the past four years, personal average albumin was 49.4 g/L, which is well above the 38 g/L threshold. The average HDL was 45.4 mg/dL, which is close to but slightly below the 47 mg/dL threshold. Continuous efforts to maintain HDL above 47 mg/dL are indicated.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

For individuals with total cholesterol levels less than 160 mg/dL, ensuring that albumin levels are relatively high (greater than 38 g/L) and HDL levels are relatively high (greater than 47 mg/dL) is crucial for reducing the risk of all-cause mortality. This combination of markers appears to differentiate between low total cholesterol indicative of biological youth and low total cholesterol associated with increased mortality risk.
