# 2023-11-08 The Kynurenine Tryptophan Ratio - An Integrated Measure Of Many Pro- And Anti-Inflammatory Factors

## Executive Summary
*   The kynurenine to tryptophan ratio (KTR) serves as an integrated biomarker reflecting both inflammatory status and antioxidant defense mechanisms in the body.
*   Tryptophan degradation into kynurenine is catalyzed by TDO (primarily liver, general metabolism) and IDO (induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines like interferons, LPS, TNF-alpha).
*   Anti-inflammatory proteins (IL-10, IL-4) and the antioxidant enzyme Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) can inhibit IDO1, thereby influencing KTR.
*   The KTR significantly increases with age; a study showed a notable rise in KTR from an average age of 59 to 70 years.
*   A relatively higher KTR (above 25 nanomoles per micromolar) is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk, while the lowest risk is observed with KTR values between 15 and 23 nanomoles per micromolar.

## The Kynurenine Tryptophan Ratio (KTR) Pathway
The amino acid tryptophan is a precursor for the formation of kynurenine. This process is mediated by two key enzymes:

*   **TDO (Tryptophan 2,3-Dioxygenase):** Primarily active in the liver, responsible for tryptophan degradation into kynurenine, especially after meals, as part of the de novo NAD synthesis pathway (Kynurenine -> NAD).
*   **IDO (Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase):** Induced under inflammatory conditions by various pro-inflammatory cytokines.

### Pro-inflammatory Induction of IDO:
*   Interferon-gamma
*   Interferon-alpha
*   Interferon-beta
*   Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
*   TNF-alpha

### Anti-inflammatory Inhibition of IDO1:
*   IL-10
*   IL-4
*   Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)

**Metabolic Pathway Summary:**
Tryptophan
  -> Kynurenine (via TDO - general metabolism, liver)
  -> Kynurenine (via IDO - inflammatory conditions)
Kynurenine
  -> NAD (via de novo NAD synthesis pathway)

In summary, the KTR integrates information about numerous pro- and anti-inflammatory factors, highlighting its importance as a comprehensive biomarker.

## KTR and Aging
The kynurenine to tryptophan ratio increases during aging. A longitudinal study demonstrated this trend:

*   **Baseline Visit:** Participants had an average age of 59 years.
*   **Follow-up Visit (11 years later):** Participants had an average age of 70 years.
*   **Result:** A significant increase in KTR was observed as participants aged from 59 to 70 years.

## KTR and All-Cause Mortality Risk
A relatively higher KTR is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.

*   The hazard ratio for all-cause mortality risk increases with higher KTR values. Significance is indicated when the confidence interval for the hazard ratio is entirely above or below one (meaning no increased or decreased risk).
*   **Lowest Risk:** KTR values between 15 to 23 nanomoles per micromolar are associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk. The confidence interval for this range was entirely below one.
*   **Increased Risk:** KTR values above 25 nanomoles per micromolar are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.
