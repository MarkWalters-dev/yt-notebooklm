# 2025-12-21 Cardiovascular Disease Biomarker Deep Dive Test 7 In 2025

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age (PhenoAge) was measured at 37.5 years, marking a 15.3-year reduction relative to chronological age.
*   While PhenoAge associates with cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality risk, it lacks direct CVD biomarkers, necessitating direct measurement of lipid and inflammation markers.
*   Triglycerides (TGs) are trending downwards (average TGs 63 mg/dL in 2025 vs. 68 mg/dL in 2022) but remain above the strict optimal target of $<45$ mg/dL.
*   LDL exhibited an inverse U-shaped trend over the last decade (increase then decrease), which is determined not just by diet but potentially by confounding factors like liver function or subclinical cancer cachexia, though these are ruled out based on concurrent biomarker profiles (AST/ALT, GGT, Albumin, HCRP).
*   Lipoprotein A (Lp(a)) remains significantly elevated, averaging 89 nmol/L over the last 10 years, far above the target derived from lifetime ASCVD risk data ($<16$ nmol/L).

## PhenoAge Components and CVD Blind Spots

The PhenoAge clock utilizes nine component biomarkers reflecting liver health, kidney function, metabolic health, inflammation, and immune status:

*   **Liver Health/Function:** Albumin, Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)
*   **Kidney Function:** Creatinine
*   **Metabolic Health:** Glucose
*   **Inflammation:** C-Reactive Protein (CRP)
*   **Immune Cells:** Lymphocyte percentage, White Blood Cell count (WBC)
*   **Red Blood Cell Measures:** Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW)

**Key Observation:** Direct cardiovascular disease-related biomarkers are notably absent from the nine components of the PhenoAge clock. Despite this, an older PhenoAge is significantly associated with increased risk for CVD-related mortality. Direct measurement of lipids (VLDL, LDL, Lp(a), HDL, ApoB) and HCRP is recommended to avoid potential blind spots.

## Cardiovascular Biomarker Analysis (Test 7 - October 27, 2025)

The following data derived from an at-home testing protocol using Ultalabtest.com and Quest Diagnostics processing.

### HDL Cholesterol

*   **Current Result:** 69 mg/dL.
*   **Lab Reference Range Optimal:** $>40$ mg/dL.
*   **Literature-Based Optimal Range:** $50 - 69$ mg/dL. (Result is at the limit of this range - Green Check).
*   **Longitudinal Trend:** HDL has been $\ge 50$ mg/dL for 20 consecutive tests.
    *   Average HDL over the last 20 tests: $59$ mg/dL.
    *   Average HDL over the previous 44 tests: $45$ mg/dL.
*   **Age-Related Change:** Avoided the typical age-related decline (Green Check).

### Triglycerides (TGs) and VLDL Approximation

VLDL concentration can be approximated by dividing Triglycerides by five ($\text{VLDL} \approx \text{TGs} / 5$).

*   **Current Result:** 52 mg/dL (Dark Orange X - slightly worse than good news).
*   **Lab Reference Range Optimal:** $<150$ mg/dL.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk Optimal:** $<90$ mg/dL.
*   **Strict Literature-Based Optimal Target:** $<45$ mg/dL (Associated with maximally reduced risk of death from coronary heart disease outcomes based on a study of 4.5 million people).

#### Longitudinal Trends & Intervention Strategy
*   **Age-Related Increase:** Trend is moving lower (Green Check).
    *   2022 Average TG: 68 mg/dL
    *   2023 Average TG: 67 mg/dL
    *   2024 Average TG: 65 mg/dL
    *   2025 (YTD) Average TG: 63 mg/dL
*   **Target Achievement:** Did not meet the $<45$ mg/dL target (Orange X).

**Dietary Note:** Achieving $<45$ mg/dL via extreme carbohydrate restriction/high fat intake negatively impacts other biomarkers in this individual's profile, indicating a need for a balanced approach across the overall biomarker panel.

### LDL Cholesterol

*   **Current Result:** 73 mg/dL.
*   **Lab Reference Range Optimal:** $<100$ mg/dL (primary prevention); $<70$ mg/dL (pre-existing CVD).
*   **Literature-Based Optimal Range (CHD Mortality Risk):** $65 - 120$ mg/dL. (Result is within range - Green Check).

#### Longitudinal Trend and Confounding Factors
LDL exhibits an **inverse U-shaped relationship** with chronological age (increases midlife, then declines in very old age). 64 tests over the last 10 years show this pattern.

**Assessing the Recent LDL Decline:** A decline in LDL over recent years requires ruling out confounding conditions:

1.  **Liver Disease:** Assessed via liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT). Current data shows AST/ALT near optimal/optimal, and GGT has consistently been $<12$ mg/dL (the derived optimal cutoff). Liver disease is unlikely.
2.  **Cancer Cachexia:** Assessed via Albumin (declines in cachexia) and HCRP (increases in cachexia). Current data shows no pattern of decline in Albumin or increase in HCRP. Stable body weight also argues against cachexia.

**Conclusion:** The LDL fluctuation (increase then decrease) is attributed primarily to changes in diet composition (playing with high-fat, high-MUFA, varying fiber levels).

### Lipoprotein A (Lp(a))

Lp(a) is a subfraction of LDL and is $6-7$ times more atherogenic per particle than standard LDL.

*   **Lifetime ASCVD Risk Optimal Target:** $<16$ nmol/L ($\approx 7$ mg/dL).
*   **Lab Reference Range Upper Limit:** $75$ nmol/L.
*   **Current Result:** 80 nmol/L (Flagged by the lab, near the reference limit).
*   **Estimated Lifetime Risk at Current Level:** $18\% - 19\%$ (compared to $\approx 13\%$ at $<16$ nmol/L).

#### Longitudinal Data and Variability
*   **Average over 10 years (36 tests):** 89 nmol/L (X - Not meeting optimal target).
*   **Recent Trend:** More recent tests trend closer to 80 nmol/L (approx. 9 nmol/L lower than the 10-year average).
*   **Variability:** Lp(a) has shown malleability, with recorded values ranging from a low of 69 nmol/L up to 145 nmol/L. This indicates diet and supplements may influence levels, arguing against measuring it only once.

#### Potential Mediators of High Lp(a) Risk
Two variables might mediate the ASCVD risk associated with elevated Lp(a): High-Sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) and Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR).

1.  **hsCRP:**
    *   **Current Result:** $0.3$ mg/L.
    *   **Literature Optimal Cutoff (All-Cause Mortality):** $\le 0.3$ mg/L.
    *   **Optimal for High Lp(a) Risk:** $<2$ mg/L.
    *   **Longitudinal Trend:** Has remained $\le 0.3$ mg/L (lab detection limit) for 28 consecutive tests since January 2022 (Good news).

2.  **Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR):**
    *   **Risk Threshold:** WHR $>1.0$ associated with increased ASCVD risk when Lp(a) $>125$ nmol/L.
    *   **Current Result:** $0.88$ (Waist: 30 inches, Hip: 34 inches). This favorable ratio likely helps mediate the risk associated with the higher Lp(a).

### Apolipoprotein B (ApoB)

ApoB is an integrated measure of atherogenic lipoproteins: VLDL, Lp(a), and LDL.

*   **Current Result:** 69 mg/dL.
*   **Lab Reference Range Optimal:** $<90$ mg/dL (Strict recommendation $<80$ mg/dL based on health status).
*   **Literature-Based Optimal Target (Heart Disease/All-Cause Mortality):** $<70$ mg/dL. (Result meets this strict target - Good news).
*   **Longitudinal Trend (8 tests over 2 years):** Average ApoB is $66.5$ mg/dL, supporting the current measurement.

## Biological Process Flowchart (LDL Decline Context)

LDL Decline $\rightarrow$ Requires distinguishing etiology:

Liver Disease ($\uparrow$ AST/ALT/GGT $\downarrow$ Albumin) $\rightarrow$ **Ruled Out** (Liver enzymes optimal/near optimal)

**OR**

Cancer Cachexia ($\downarrow$ Albumin / $\uparrow$ HCRP / Weight Loss) $\rightarrow$ **Ruled Out** (Albumin/HC RP stable, weight stable)

**Therefore:** LDL Decline $\rightarrow$ Attributed to **Diet/Supplement Modulation** (High-fat, high-MUFA, varying fiber interventions).
