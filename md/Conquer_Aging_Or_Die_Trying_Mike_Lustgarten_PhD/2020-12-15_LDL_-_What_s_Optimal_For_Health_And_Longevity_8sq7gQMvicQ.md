# 2020-12-15 LDL - What's Optimal For Health And Longevity

## Executive Summary

*   A 2004 paper proposed an optimal LDL concentration of 50-70 mg/dL for health. However, data from youth shows average LDL levels closer to 100-120 mg/dL, suggesting the 50-70 mg/dL range may be inaccurate.
*   Multiple large-scale studies in non-statin users consistently indicate that for men, LDL levels below 70 mg/dL are associated with a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality, particularly in younger and middle-aged adults.
*   In older adult populations (average age 58-74 years), the lowest all-cause mortality risk for non-statin users is often observed at higher LDL levels, around 130-143 mg/dL, with increased risk for both very low and very high LDL values.
*   Analysis controlling for reverse causation (by excluding subjects with early mortality, CVD, cancer, or COPD) still demonstrates that lower LDL levels are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   Data from centenarians (average age 102 years) shows an average LDL of 107 mg/dL, further challenging the notion that 50-70 mg/dL is optimal for extreme longevity. For healthy, disease-free, non-statin users, an optimal LDL range appears to be 100-140 mg/dL.

## Introduction: The Optimal LDL Debate

A 2004 paper proposed that the optimal concentration for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is 50-70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). To investigate this claim, various population studies on LDL levels across different age groups and their association with all-cause mortality risk are examined.

Data on LDL levels in youth, specifically men aged 15-34, shows an average LDL of 120 mg/dL. For women in the same age group, the average LDL is 108 mg/dL. These values are considerably higher than the proposed 50-70 mg/dL range, suggesting this proposed optimal range may be inconsistent with levels observed in healthy young individuals.

## All-Cause Mortality Risk in Younger Adults

### Kangbuk Samsung Health Study

This study included over 347,000 non-statin users. Subjects with a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or diabetes were excluded to prevent disease-related factors from skewing the LDL and mortality data, which could otherwise falsely associate low LDL with illness. The analysis included 199,000 men and 148,000 women.

**Findings in Men:**
*   The lowest all-cause mortality risk was found for LDL levels between 100-129 mg/dL.
*   LDL levels less than 70 mg/dL were associated with a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   LDL levels greater than 160 mg/dL showed a slight increase in risk, but the higher risk for lower LDL was more pronounced.

**Findings in Women:**
*   In fully adjusted models, LDL levels were not significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk in women in this study.

## All-Cause Mortality Risk in Middle-Aged Adults

### Korean Genome Epidemiology Study

This study analyzed non-statin users with an average age of 53 years. Individuals taking lipid-lowering medications (statins) were excluded from the analysis.

**Findings in Men (63,000 subjects):**
*   Compared to a reference LDL range of 100-129 mg/dL:
    *   Men with LDL of 70-99 mg/dL had a 37% higher risk for all-cause mortality.
    *   Men with LDL less than 70 mg/dL had an 83% higher risk for all-cause mortality.
*   Higher LDL levels (greater than 129 mg/dL) were not significantly different from the 100-129 mg/dL reference group in terms of all-cause mortality risk. This indicates that lower LDL levels in this age group are detrimental to health.

**Findings in Women (120,000 subjects):**
*   Similar to the previous study, LDL levels at this age were not associated with all-cause mortality risk in women who were not taking statins.

## All-Cause Mortality Risk in Older Adults

### Copenhagen General Population Study

This study included approximately 42,000 men and 40,000 women who were not taking statins, with an average age of 58 years.

**Findings in Men:**
*   The lowest all-cause mortality risk was found at approximately 140 mg/dL.
*   Increased all-cause mortality risk was observed for LDL values less than 131 mg/dL.
*   Increased all-cause mortality risk was also observed for LDL values greater than 189 mg/dL.
*   This suggests a "sweet spot" for LDL in this age group, with both very low and very high levels carrying increased risk.

**Findings in Women:**
*   Unlike the earlier studies in younger women, this older cohort showed a significant association between LDL and all-cause mortality risk.
*   The lowest all-cause mortality risk was associated with an LDL of 143 mg/dL.
*   Increased risk was observed for lower levels (less than 92 mg/dL) and for higher levels (greater than 189 mg/dL).
*   Again, a "sweet spot" for LDL was identified for minimizing all-cause mortality risk in older women.

## Addressing Reverse Causation

To determine if the observed increased mortality risk at low LDL levels was due to pre-existing illness (reverse causation), the Copenhagen General Population Study authors implemented several exclusions:

1.  **Exclusion of subjects without 5-year follow-up data:** This aimed to remove individuals who might have died early in the study due to underlying illness, thus lacking extended follow-up.
2.  **Exclusion of subjects diagnosed with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease at baseline.**
3.  **Exclusion of subjects diagnosed with cancer at baseline.**
4.  **Exclusion of subjects diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at baseline.**

Even after these rigorous exclusions, the findings remained consistent:
*   When subjects without 5-year follow-up data were removed, low LDL was still associated with increased all-cause mortality risk, with the lowest risk around 143 mg/dL.
*   After removing individuals with atherosclerosis at baseline, the lowest risk was around 140 mg/dL, with increasing risk for both low and high LDL levels.
*   Excluding individuals with cancer at baseline similarly showed optimal LDL around 143 mg/dL, with higher risk for lower values.
*   Excluding individuals with COPD at baseline also revealed that having LDL values too low or too high (above 132 mg/dL) was associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.

These analyses strongly suggest that the increased mortality risk associated with low LDL is not solely explained by reverse causation from pre-existing illnesses.

## All-Cause Mortality Risk in Advanced Age

### Study in 74-Year-Olds

A study of approximately 70,000 subjects with an average age of 74 years showed a decreasing all-cause mortality risk as LDL levels increased, up to values around 141 mg/dL. Compared to those with LDL less than 100 mg/dL, subjects with LDL greater than 140-141 mg/dL had a lower all-cause mortality risk. This data indicates that higher, but not excessively high, LDL is preferable to lower LDL in this older age group.

### Study in 94-Year-Olds

Data from 935 subjects with an average age of 94 years demonstrated that individuals with LDL greater than 130 mg/dL had better survival rates over a 3.5-year period compared to those with LDL less than 130 mg/dL. This further supports the trend of higher LDL being associated with better outcomes in very old age.

## LDL Levels in Centenarians

To determine LDL levels in individuals achieving extreme longevity, data from 1,002 centenarians (average age 102 years) was examined. The average LDL value in this cohort was 107 mg/dL. This finding directly contradicts the hypothesis that an optimal LDL for longevity is 50-70 mg/dL.

## Conclusion

Based on a comprehensive review of multiple studies focusing on healthy, disease-free, non-statin users across various age groups, the proposed optimal LDL range of 50-70 mg/dL appears inaccurate. The evidence consistently suggests that for minimizing all-cause mortality risk, an LDL concentration within the range of **100-140 mg/dL** is optimal. In many older populations, even higher LDL levels within this range are associated with better health outcomes than very low levels.
