# 2021-08-20 Vitamins K1 And K2 Are Associated With Reduced Cardiovascular Disease-Related Hospitalization Risk

## Executive Summary

*   Optimal Vitamin K1 intake, specifically up to 280 micrograms per day, is associated with a 30% decreased risk of total atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)-related hospitalizations.
*   Optimal Vitamin K2 intake, ranging from 60 to 80 micrograms per day, is linked to a maximally decreased hospitalization risk for total ASCVD and ischemic heart disease. However, Vitamin K2 intake showed no significant association with peripheral artery disease hospitalization risk.
*   Current adequate intake recommendations for Vitamin K (90-120 micrograms per day) may be too low, as the combined optimal intake for K1 and K2 to reduce ASCVD hospitalization risk appears to be around 350 micrograms per day.
*   Rich dietary sources of Vitamin K1 include spinach (over 2000 micrograms per 100 calories), while margarine and lettuce were also significant contributors in the study.
*   Major dietary sources of Vitamin K2 (primarily MK-4, MK-8, and MK-9 isoforms) in the study population included eggs, butter, and cheeses (Brie, blue cheese), with other rich sources identified as hard cheddar cheese, 4% fat cottage cheese, and full-fat Greek yogurt.

## Introduction & Study Overview

Current adequate intake guidelines for Vitamin K are 90 micrograms per day for adult women and 120 micrograms per day for adult men. This study investigated whether these ranges are optimal for health by examining the association between Vitamin K intake and the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)-related hospitalization.

This large-scale study involved over 53,000 subjects with a median age of 56 years and a 21-year follow-up period. Vitamin K comprises two main isoforms: Vitamin K1 and Vitamin K2. The analysis aimed to determine if either or both are associated with reduced ASCVD-related hospitalization risk. The models used in the study were adjusted for several factors that could influence these associations, including age, sex, BMI, smoking status, income, physical activity, alcohol intake, and education.

ASCVD can be subdivided into:
*   **Ischemic stroke:** Atherosclerosis in arteries supplying the brain.
*   **Ischemic heart disease:** Coronary artery atherosclerosis (plaque buildup and narrowing of arteries supplying the heart, limiting blood and oxygen, leading to cell death).
*   **Peripheral artery disease:** Atherosclerosis in arteries supplying the limbs (arms and legs).

## Vitamin K1 Intake and Cardiovascular Risk

Analysis of Vitamin K1 intake revealed a significant association with ASCVD-related hospitalization risk. Individuals consuming up to 280 micrograms of Vitamin K1 per day showed approximately a 30% decreased risk for total ASCVD-related hospitalizations. Conversely, those consuming less than 50 micrograms per day of Vitamin K1 had a significantly increased risk of ASCVD-related hospitalizations.

Furthermore, higher intakes of Vitamin K1 (up to 280 micrograms per day) were associated with a significantly decreased risk of atherosclerosis in arteries supplying the brain, heart, and limbs across all three subdivisions of ASCVD (ischemic stroke, ischemic heart disease, and peripheral artery disease). Individuals with lower Vitamin K1 intake (less than 50 micrograms per day) experienced an increased risk of hospitalizations related to atherosclerosis in these areas.

Based on these findings, an intake of 280 micrograms per day of Vitamin K1 may be optimal for reducing the risk of ASCVD-related hospitalization.

## Vitamin K2 Intake and Cardiovascular Risk

Investigation into Vitamin K2 intake similarly showed associations with ASCVD-related hospitalization risk. For total ASCVD-related hospitalizations and ischemic heart disease-related hospitalizations, Vitamin K2 intakes in the range of 60 to 75 micrograms per day were associated with a maximally decreased hospitalization risk. For ischemic stroke, a slightly higher range of 70 to 85 micrograms per day of Vitamin K2 was associated with reduced hospitalization risk.

However, Vitamin K2 intake was not significantly associated with peripheral artery disease hospitalization risk. Additionally, very low intakes of Vitamin K2 (closer to zero) and higher intakes (above approximately 100 micrograms per day) were not significantly associated with hospitalization for any of these atherosclerosis-related conditions.

From these data, an intake of Vitamin K2 in the range of 60 to 80 micrograms per day may be optimal for decreasing the risk of ASCVD-related hospitalizations.

## Optimal Intake & Current Recommendations

The study's findings suggest that the currently recommended adequate intake of 90 to 120 micrograms per day for total Vitamin K may be insufficient for optimal cardiovascular health. Considering the optimal intakes identified for K1 (280 micrograms/day) and K2 (60-80 micrograms/day), a total Vitamin K intake closer to 350 micrograms per day may be necessary to significantly reduce the risk of atherosclerosis-related hospitalizations. This indicates that current recommendations may be too low for preventing these cardiovascular events.

## Dietary Sources of Vitamin K1

In this study, the primary dietary sources of Vitamin K1 were margarine and lettuce. Smaller amounts were derived from broccoli, whole wheat bread, and spinach.

It is important to note the varying potency of these sources:
*   Margarine and whole wheat bread are relatively poor sources of Vitamin K1.
*   Spinach stands out as a highly potent source, providing over 2000 micrograms of Vitamin K1 per 100 calories. Consuming just 15 grams (approximately half an ounce) of spinach daily could help individuals meet the 280 micrograms of Vitamin K1 associated with maximally reduced ASCVD hospitalization risk.

## Dietary Sources of Vitamin K2

Four Vitamin K2 isoforms, specifically menaquinones MK-4, MK-8, and MK-9, accounted for approximately 85-86% of the total Vitamin K2 intake in the study population. These were primarily derived from:
*   Eggs
*   Butter
*   Cheeses, including both hard and soft varieties (e.g., Brie, blue cheese)

When considering Vitamin K2 content normalized per 100 calories, several common sources, such as egg yolk, blue cheese, Brie cheese, and butter, contained relatively low amounts of Vitamin K2 (less than 20 micrograms per 100 calories).

However, other richer sources of Vitamin K2, though not necessarily consumed by all participants in this study, include:
*   Hard cheddar cheese: 70 micrograms per 100 calories
*   4% fat cottage cheese: 52 micrograms per 100 calories
*   Full-fat Greek yogurt: 28 micrograms per 100 calories
