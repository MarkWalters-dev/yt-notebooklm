# 2023-04-09 Resting Heart Rate Heart Rate Variability - Is Q1 2023 Better Than 2022

## Executive Summary
*   Resting Heart Rate (RHR) generally increases up to approximately 50 years of age, then shows a decline in older age.
*   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) consistently declines with increasing age.
*   A low RHR combined with high HRV is indicative of youth, whereas a low RHR with low HRV is characteristic of advanced age.
*   In Q1 2023, the speaker's average RHR significantly decreased (44.4 beats per minute) and HRV significantly increased (62.1 milliseconds) compared to 2022, indicating a more youthful physiological profile.
*   Improvements in these metrics are attributed to balancing activity and rest (avoiding overtraining) and reductions in body fat.

## Age-Related Changes in Resting Heart Rate (RHR)

Resting heart rate changes throughout life. Data from wearable devices shows that RHR generally increases for both men and women up to about 50 years of age. Further studies utilizing data from a large cohort (approximately 90,000 people) across an age range of 20 to 85 years corroborate this trend: RHR increases up to around 50 years, then declines thereafter until 85 years. This pattern suggests that relatively low resting heart rates can be found in both young individuals and those of advanced age.

## What is Heart Rate Variability (HRV)?

Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is defined as the variability in the time intervals between consecutive heartbeats. While a heart rate of 60 beats per minute might suggest an exact one-second interval between beats, this is not precise. The actual time between successive heartbeats is not constant; this fluctuation is what HRV measures. A common metric for HRV is RMSSD, or the root mean squared of successive differences between heartbeats.

## Age-Related Changes in Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

HRV consistently declines during aging. For example, data across an age range of 20 to 60 years shows median RMSSD values approaching 80 in 20-year-olds, which halve to about 40 in 60-year-olds. If extrapolated beyond 60 years, HRV would continue to decrease. It's also observed that HRV values are typically higher in the morning compared to the evening for all age groups.

## RHR and HRV: Distinguishing Youth from Advanced Age

To determine if a relatively low RHR is indicative of youth or aging, HRV provides crucial context:
*   **Youthful profile:** Low RHR combined with high HRV.
*   **Advanced age profile:** Low RHR combined with low HRV.

## 2023 Q1 Data vs. 2022: Personal Metrics

The speaker has tracked personal RHR and HRV data since 2018, accumulating nearly 1700 days of data.

**Resting Heart Rate:**
*   **2023 Q1 Average:** 44.4 beats per minute (bpm)
*   **Comparison to 2022:** Significantly reduced (based on a two-sample t-test).
*   **Comparison to 2018 (Starting Point):** Significantly lower than the initial 50.9 bpm.
This demonstrates that reducing one's resting heart rate is achievable.

**Heart Rate Variability:**
*   **2023 Q1 Average:** 62.1 milliseconds (ms)
*   **Comparison to 2022:** Significantly higher (based on a two-sample t-test).
*   **Comparison to 2018 (Starting Point):** Significantly higher than the initial 47 ms.
This indicates that increasing heart rate variability is also possible and does not necessarily follow an age-related decline.

**Overall Profile for 2023 Q1:**
The speaker's current profile of a relatively high HRV (average 62.1 ms) and lower RHR (average 44.4 bpm) is indicative of a relatively youthful physiological state. This contrasts with the expected profile for the speaker's chronological age (based on general population graphs), which would suggest a lower HRV (e.g., 35 ms) and a higher RHR (e.g., 57 bpm).

## Factors Contributing to Improved Metrics

Improvements in RHR and HRV observed in 2023 are attributed to:
*   Balancing activity versus rest to avoid overtraining.
*   Body weight reduction, specifically focusing on becoming leaner in terms of body fat.
