# 2025-03-05 Biological Age Age At Menopause And Longevity 4 Studies

## Executive Summary

*   An older biological age, as measured by PhenoAgeAccel, is significantly associated with an earlier age at menopause. Women with the oldest biological ages had an average age at menopause of 40 years, while those with the youngest biological ages approached 60 years.
*   An older age at menopause is consistently linked to a longer life expectancy, with data from multiple studies supporting this association.
*   Women who experienced menopause at 55 years or older had an average life expectancy approximately two years longer than those who experienced it before 40 years.
*   Delaying menopause by 10 years, from 35 to 45 years, was associated with an extension in median lifespan of about two years.
*   At the 25% survival mark, women who experienced menopause at 55 years lived approximately three years longer than those who experienced it at 40 years.

## Biological Age and Age at Menopause

This analysis explored the relationship between biological age and the age at which menopause occurs. Biological age was quantified using PhenoAgeAccel, a metric that indicates whether biological age is higher or lower than chronological age. A positive PhenoAgeAccel suggests an older biological age relative to chronological age, while a negative value indicates a younger biological age.

The data reveals a significant association: an older biological age is linked to an earlier age at menopause. Specifically, women who exhibited the oldest biological ages relative to their chronological age had an average age at menopause of 40 years. Conversely, women with younger biological ages relative to their chronological age experienced a later age at menopause, with some approaching 60 years.

## Age at Menopause and Longevity: Evidence from Three Studies

An older age at menopause is a significant indicator for longevity, consistently associated with an increased life expectancy.

### Study 1: Life Expectancy Correlation

This study investigated the direct correlation between age at menopause and average life expectancy.
*   Women who experienced menopause at younger than 40 years had an average life expectancy of 78 years.
*   In contrast, women who experienced menopause at 55 years or older had an average life expectancy of over 80 years, indicating approximately two years longer life.
*   A clear positive correlation was observed: as the age at menopause increased, so did the average life expectancy.

### Study 2: Median Survival Analysis

This study evaluated survival probability over time, defining median survival as the age at which half of the study's women had died.
*   When comparing women who experienced menopause at 35 years with those who experienced it 10 years later at 45 years, there was a significant extension in median lifespan of about two years for the later menopause group.

### Study 3: 25% Survival and Longevity

This study first assessed 25% survival, representing the age at which 25% of the women in the study had died.
*   Women who experienced menopause at 55 years showed a significantly later 25% survival age compared to women who experienced menopause at 40 years.
*   This difference translated to approximately a three-year longer life expectancy at the 25% survival mark for the group with later menopause.
*   While a full assessment of median survival was not possible as many women in both groups were still alive, the trend strongly indicated a longevity advantage associated with an older age at menopause.
