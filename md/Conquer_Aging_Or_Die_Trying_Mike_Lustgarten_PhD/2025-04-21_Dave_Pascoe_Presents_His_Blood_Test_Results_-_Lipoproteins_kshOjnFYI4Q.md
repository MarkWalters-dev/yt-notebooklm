# 2025-04-21 Dave Pascoe Presents His Blood Test Results - Lipoproteins

### Executive Summary

*   Optimal APOB levels below 76 mg/dL are associated with the lowest risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), based on a 2021 longitudinal study (Amoris, Waldius).
*   HDL levels can resist age-related decline; Dave Pascoe's recent data shows an HDL of 58 mg/dL, with an upward trend over time.
*   Triglyceride levels less than 45 mg/dL are linked to the lowest heart disease mortality risk.
*   Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) levels can show significant variability in individuals, contrary to the common understanding of genetic stability, making its role relative to APOB in atherogenesis complex.
*   Adjusted epidemiological studies, which account for numerous comorbidities (e.g., cancer, liver, kidney disease), suggest an optimal LDL range of 65-120 mg/dL for coronary heart disease mortality risk.

## APOB Levels and Cardiovascular Risk

Dave Pascoe's average APOB level is 87 mg/dL, which is above his optimal range for cardiovascular health.

Current reference ranges for APOB often lag behind the latest research. For example:
*   Quest Diagnostics uses a reference based on the 2004 Amoris study by Waldius, suggesting less than 115 mg/dL.
*   Life Extension suggests less than 109 mg/dL.

More recent data from the same Amoris study, with a longer 17-year follow-up (Waldius, 2021), indicates that APOB levels less than 76 mg/dL are associated with the lowest risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular disease mortality. While risk increases above 76 mg/dL, levels up to 92 mg/dL may still be considered in a "green" range, but not for the lowest risk.

Given a history of minor plaque, a personal target for APOB is set between 52-60 mg/dL, aiming for levels as low as physically possible.

## HDL Trends

Dave Pascoe's most recent HDL data shows a level of 58 mg/dL, with an upward trend. HDL typically peaks in youth and then declines in men, stabilizing in the low fifties with age. Dave's current levels indicate he has resisted this age-related decline.

The optimal HDL range is set based on age. For individuals aged 60 and above, this optimal range may differ from that for younger individuals (e.g., 30, 40, or 50 years old). The specific interventions contributing to Dave's improved HDL levels were not identified during the discussion.

## Triglycerides and Heart Disease Risk

Dave Pascoe's triglyceride levels are around 60 mg/dL, which is considered good. However, they are still above the ideal target of less than 45 mg/dL, which is associated with the lowest heart disease mortality risk. The data shows a mild upward trend in his triglyceride levels.

## Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) Variability and Dietary Influence

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels have shown significant variability in Dave Pascoe's tests, ranging from 15 to 33 mg/dL. This variability contradicts the common understanding that Lp(a) levels remain relatively stable due to genetic determination.

The role of Lp(a) in atherogenesis relative to APOB is still being investigated, with some published data suggesting Lp(a) may be more atherogenic than LDL. A key question remains whether to prioritize reducing Lp(a) alongside APOB if Lp(a) levels are elevated.

In another individual's experience, limiting a higher fat diet has been associated with a 50% reduction in Lp(a) over approximately ten years. However, this strategy presents a U-shaped response:
*   Very high-fat intake can lead to elevated biomarkers, including red blood cells, hemoglobin (closer to 16), and glucose.
*   Balancing Lp(a) optimization with other metabolic markers is crucial to avoid negative impacts on overall health.

Dave Pascoe's diet is notably high in fats, primarily from nuts (almonds, walnuts, peanuts, Brazil nuts, cashews, sunflower seeds) and avocado. The approximate percentage of caloric intake from fat in his diet is unknown.

## LDL Cholesterol and All-Cause Mortality

Dave Pascoe's APOB levels are higher than desired, but this is not attributed to triglycerides or VLDL, as his triglyceride levels are relatively low, suggesting LDL as a primary contributor to APOB.

LDL is a controversial topic in health discussions. Epidemiological studies on LDL's association with all-cause mortality present conflicting results, with some earlier studies suggesting higher LDL (e.g., 130-180 mg/dL) is associated with lower risk.

LDL levels typically follow an inverse U-shape during aging, being low in youth and also low in advanced age. This complicates interpretation, as both very low and very high levels can appear at different life stages. Furthermore, higher LDL in 80-year-olds has been associated with lower all-cause mortality risk compared to those with lower LDL, though LDL often declines at the end of life, potentially due to underlying conditions like cancer cachexia or undiagnosed cancer.

Accurate epidemiological studies need to adjust for numerous factors that impact LDL's association with heart disease or all-cause mortality. Many standard models only account for age, sex, BMI, and preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD). A large study involving 4.7 million people, which adjusted for 11 comorbidities including cancer diagnosis, CVD, age, sex, BMI, dementia, liver disease, and kidney disease, found an optimal range for coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality risk to be 65-120 mg/dL. This more comprehensively adjusted data challenges earlier findings that suggested higher LDL was universally better for all-cause mortality risk. Dave Pascoe's LDL target of 120 mg/dL may be based on earlier, less adjusted data.

## Atherosclerotic Plaque Progression

Minor calcified and non-calcified plaque buildup was observed in Dave Pascoe's arteries. Approximately five years prior, a coronary calcium CT scan showed a score of zero. The current detectable plaque represents a change from zero, which is concerning, although the overall plaque burden remains very low.

A critical question is whether reducing APOB to lower levels (e.g., 50-60 mg/dL compared to 80 mg/dL) can slow the rate of plaque progression over time.
