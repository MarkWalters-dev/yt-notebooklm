# 2024-01-17 How Much Dietary Fiber Is Optimal For Health

## Executive Summary

*   A meta-analysis of 14 studies (over 1.3 million people) found that total fiber intake up to 40 grams per day was significantly associated with a 45% reduced risk for all-cause mortality.
*   Further analysis by fiber source revealed distinct optimal intakes associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk:
    *   **Legume fiber:** 5 grams/day (12% reduced risk).
    *   **Vegetable fiber:** 15 grams/day (35% reduced risk).
    *   **Cereal/Whole Grain fiber:** 7 grams/day (22% reduced risk); higher intakes up to 10 grams/day showed similar risk reduction.
    *   **Fruit fiber:** 4 grams/day (21% reduced risk); intakes above 7-8 grams/day were not significantly associated with further risk reduction.
*   While many confounding factors were adjusted for (BMI, smoking, age, alcohol, physical activity, calorie intake, sex), most studies did not adjust for sugar-sweetened beverages or ultra-processed food intake, suggesting a potential "healthy user bias" that warrants further investigation.

## Total Dietary Fiber and All-Cause Mortality

A meta-analysis of 14 studies, including over 1,300,000 people, investigated the association between total fiber intake and all-cause mortality risk. The data indicates that as fiber intake increased up to 40 grams per day, it was significantly associated with a 45% reduced risk for all-cause mortality.

To address potential "healthy user bias" (where people eating high-fiber diets might be generally healthier), the studies were adjusted for various factors that can impact the association between fiber and all-cause mortality risk. These adjustments included BMI (adjusted in all 14 studies), smoking, age, alcohol drinking, physical activity, energy/calorie intake, and sex (adjusted in at least 8 of the 14 studies).

A notable limitation of these studies is the lack of adjustment for sugar-sweetened beverages (only one study adjusted for this) and ultra-processed food intake (none of the studies adjusted for this). These unadjusted factors are themselves associated with poor health outcomes. Future research should include adjustments for these factors to ascertain whether the observed associations are direct effects of fiber or partly attributable to healthy user bias related to overall dietary patterns.

## Fiber from Specific Sources and All-Cause Mortality

The meta-analysis further explored the impact of fiber from different sources on all-cause mortality risk.

### Legume Fiber

A meta-analysis of four studies, involving more than 221,000 people, examined legume fiber intake. Legume fiber intake up to 4 grams per day was not significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk. However, an intake of 5 grams of legume fiber per day was significantly associated with a 12% reduced risk for all-cause mortality.

*   **Example:** 41 grams (dry weight) of chickpeas provides approximately 5 grams of fiber, at a cost of about 155 calories.

### Vegetable Fiber

A meta-analysis of five studies, including more than 674,000 people, assessed vegetable fiber intake. A significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk was observed starting at 7.5 grams of vegetable fiber per day. The maximally reduced risk was found at 15 grams of vegetable fiber per day, which was associated with a 35% reduced all-cause mortality risk.

*   **Example:** Approximately 1 pound of broccoli provides 15 grams of fiber, at a cost of about 158 calories.

### Cereal/Whole Grain Fiber

A meta-analysis of seven studies, encompassing up to 1.1 million people, investigated cereal fiber (whole grain fiber) intake. A significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk began at 3.5 grams of cereal fiber per day. A maximally reduced risk was associated with whole grain/cereal fiber intakes of 7 grams per day, corresponding to a 22% reduced risk for all-cause mortality. Higher intakes, up to 10 grams per day, showed a similar risk reduction.

*   **Example:** 70 grams (dry weight) of steel-cut oats provides 7 grams of fiber, at a cost of about 265 calories.

### Fruit Fiber

A meta-analysis of five studies, including more than 674,000 people, analyzed fruit fiber intake. The maximally reduced all-cause mortality risk was observed at 4 grams of fruit fiber per day, which was associated with a 21% reduced all-cause mortality risk. At higher fruit fiber intakes, specifically above 7-8 grams per day, the association with reduced all-cause mortality risk was no longer statistically significant.

*   **Example:** 200 grams of strawberries provides 4 grams of fiber, at a cost of about 70 calories.
