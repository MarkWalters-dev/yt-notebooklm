# 2024-11-28 Red Light Therapy Reduces Blood Glucose - Glen Jeffery PhD

## Executive Summary

*   Red light therapy, particularly with wavelengths of 670nm and 850nm, significantly reduces the post-prandial blood glucose spike in humans.
*   The mechanism appears to involve increased cellular respiration, indicated by an elevated CO2 output, suggesting enhanced mitochondrial activity and glucose utilization.
*   Deeper red light (850nm), which is invisible to the human eye, is also effective in lowering blood glucose and improving visual function, suggesting broader applicability.
*   Red light therapy can be administered discreetly, without subject awareness, to achieve physiological benefits.

## Human Experiment - Blood Glucose Response

This experiment involved human subjects who underwent an overnight fast before consuming a large glucose load. Blood glucose levels were monitored at regular intervals.

### Protocol:

*   Subjects fasted overnight.
*   Subjects consumed a large glucose load.
*   Blood glucose levels were measured every few minutes via finger pricks.
*   CO2 output was measured to assess cellular respiration.

### Findings:

*   **Control Group (Green Data):** After consuming the glucose load, blood glucose levels showed a significant and prolonged increase, slowly returning to baseline after approximately one hour.
*   **Red Light Therapy Group (Red Data):**
    *   When exposed to a burst of red light (670nm) over a small area of the back, the blood glucose spike was attenuated.
    *   CO2 output increased in this group, indicating enhanced oxygen and glucose utilization by mitochondria.

## Deeper Red Light Therapy (850nm)

Further investigation explored the efficacy of deeper red light wavelengths.

### Protocol:

*   Subjects were invited for a cup of coffee.
*   Subjects were seated next to a panel emitting 850nm light (invisible to the human eye).
*   Later, blood glucose and visual function were measured.

### Findings:

*   Exposure to 850nm red light led to improvements in both blood glucose levels and visual function.
*   This indicates that the beneficial effects are not limited to the visible red spectrum (670nm) and that imperceptible light can also induce physiological changes.

## Implications

The findings suggest that red light therapy has the potential to:

*   Manage post-prandial hyperglycemia.
*   Enhance mitochondrial function and energy metabolism.
*   Be delivered discreetly and without subject awareness, making it a practical therapeutic option.
*   Potentially benefit individuals with compromised mitochondrial function by stimulating cellular activity.
