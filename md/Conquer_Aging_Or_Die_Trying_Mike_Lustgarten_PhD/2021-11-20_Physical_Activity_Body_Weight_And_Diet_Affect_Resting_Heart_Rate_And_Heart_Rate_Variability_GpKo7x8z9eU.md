# 2021-11-20 Physical Activity Body Weight And Diet Affect Resting Heart Rate And Heart Rate Variability

## Executive Summary

*   Increased average daily physical activity is significantly correlated with a *higher* next-day resting heart rate and *lower* heart rate variability.
*   Higher body weight is significantly correlated with a higher resting heart rate and lower heart rate variability. A body weight around 151 pounds appears to optimize both metrics.
*   Higher daily calorie intake is significantly correlated with a higher resting heart rate and lower heart rate variability.
*   After adjusting for daily exertion and calorie intake, specific macronutrient compositions show distinct associations with heart rate variability: monounsaturated fatty acids, omega-6, and protein intake are associated with *higher* HRV, while fructose, saturated fatty acids, and fiber intake are associated with *lower* HRV.
*   For resting heart rate, higher monounsaturated fatty acids and omega-6 are associated with *lower* RHR, while higher saturated fatty acids, protein, and fiber intake are associated with *higher* RHR.

## Definitions

*   **Resting Heart Rate (RHR):** Heart rate in beats per minute (BPM) while at rest.
*   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** The variation in the time interval between consecutive heartbeats. Even at a constant BPM, the exact timing of each beat fluctuates.

## Aging Trends

### Resting Heart Rate (RHR)

*   A study of over 90,000 people showed that RHR increases from age 20 to approximately 50 years, after which it decreases up to age 85.

### Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

*   A study of over 8.2 million subjects looking at RMSSD (root mean squared of successive differences), a metric for HRV, from age 20 to 60 years revealed a significant decline.
*   HRV for a 20-year-old is approximately 70s, declining to about half that by age 60.
*   This trend of declining HRV with age is observed for both morning (6 AM) and evening (6 PM) measurements.
*   **Advanced Age:** Characterized by relatively low RHR and low HRV.
*   **Youth:** Characterized by relatively low RHR (compared to 50-year-olds) and high HRV.

## Factors Impacting RHR and HRV

### Physical Activity

*   **Data Source:** Personal fitness tracker data, including average daily heart rate (whole day, not just resting).
*   **Correlation:**
    *   Higher average daily heart rate (indicating more activity) is significantly correlated with a **higher next-day resting heart rate**.
    *   Higher average daily heart rate is significantly correlated with **lower heart rate variability**.

### Body Weight

*   **Data Source:** Personal morning body weight measurements and corresponding RHR/HRV data (over 1,200 days).
*   **Correlation:**
    *   Higher body weight is significantly correlated with a **higher resting heart rate**.
    *   Lower body weight is significantly correlated with **higher heart rate variability**.
*   **Optimized Metrics:** Approximately 151 pounds is correlated with the lowest RHR and highest HRV.

### Daily Exertion/Strain

*   **Metric:** Calculated by multiplying body weight by average daily heart rate. This combines the effort of carrying weight with the intensity of activity.
*   **Correlation:**
    *   Higher daily exertion is significantly correlated with a **higher next-day resting heart rate**.
    *   Higher daily exertion is significantly correlated with **lower heart rate variability**.

### Diet - Calorie Intake

*   **Data Source:** Personal daily calorie intake tracking.
*   **Correlation:**
    *   Higher calorie intake is significantly correlated with a **higher resting heart rate**.
    *   Higher calorie intake is significantly correlated with a **lower heart rate variability**.

## Diet Composition (Macronutrients)

*   **Methodology:** Linear regression models were adjusted for daily exertion (body weight * average daily heart rate) and calorie intake, in addition to each respective macronutrient. This accounts for the known impact of these factors.
*   **Contribution of Daily Exertion & Calorie Intake:**
    *   These factors explain 5.7% of the variance in HRV.
    *   These factors explain 6% of the variance in RHR.

### Macronutrient Associations with Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

*   **Associated with Higher HRV:**
    *   Monounsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFA)
    *   Omega-6 Fatty Acids
    *   Protein Intake
*   **Associated with Lower HRV:**
    *   Fructose
    *   Saturated Fatty Acids (SFA)
    *   Fiber Intake
*   **Additional Variance Explained:**
    *   Fiber: 2.1% (Total for model: 7.8%)
    *   MUFA: 0.4%
    *   Omega-6: 0.3%
*   **Not Statistically Significant for HRV:** Non-fructose carbohydrates (close, p=0.06), Omega-3 fatty acids.

### Macronutrient Associations with Resting Heart Rate (RHR)

*   **Associated with Lower RHR:**
    *   Monounsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFA)
    *   Omega-6 Fatty Acids
*   **Associated with Higher RHR:**
    *   Carbohydrate Intake (both non-fructose and fructose)
    *   Saturated Fatty Acids (SFA)
    *   Protein Intake
    *   Fiber Intake
*   **Additional Variance Explained:** None of these macronutrients individually explained a significant additional percentage of variance in RHR on their own.

## Summary of Findings

*   Physical activity, body weight, and calorie intake can be titrated to optimize both resting heart rate and heart rate variability.
*   Specific diet compositions show distinct associations with HRV and RHR.
*   Personalized dietary adjustments based on these associations may optimize next-day HRV after workouts and RHR.
*   Further investigation is needed to determine if optimizing cardiovascular metrics through these dietary strategies has a net positive or negative impact on overall health biomarkers.
