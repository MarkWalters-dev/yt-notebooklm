# 2023-08-13 Is Glutamate A Marker Of Low NAD

## Executive Summary

*   Elevated levels of glutamate in plasma are associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality.
*   A potential mechanism for increased glutamate is its role in attempting to bypass an age-related block in the citric acid cycle, particularly at isocitrate dehydrogenase.
*   This age-related block and subsequent accumulation of upstream metabolites (citrate, aconitate, isocitrate) and related molecules (pyruvate) may be exacerbated by declining NAD+ levels, which are crucial cofactors for key enzymatic reactions.
*   Histidine, conversely, declines with age and its higher levels are associated with reduced mortality risk; it can be converted to glutamate, suggesting a compensatory mechanism when NAD+ is low.
*   Tracking and optimizing levels of metabolites like histidine, glutamate, and aconitate may provide insights into aging processes and potential interventions.

## Plasma Metabolites and Mortality Risk

### Increased Risk Metabolites
*   **Cotinine:** A marker of tobacco use.
*   **Methionine Sulfoxide:** A marker of oxidative stress.
*   **Glutamate:** Higher levels are associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality. This may be a marker of low NAD+.

### Reduced Risk Metabolites
*   **Beta Carotene:** Found in carrots and greens.
*   **Ergothioneine:** Found in mushrooms.
*   **Histidine:** Higher levels are associated with a reduced risk for all-cause mortality.

## Citric Acid Cycle (TCA Cycle) Dysfunction During Aging

During aging, there is evidence of a block at **Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH)**.

**TCA Cycle Visualization:**

```
Citrate -> Cis Aconitate -> Isocitrate -> 2-Oxoglutarate (Alpha-Ketoglutarate)
                                ^
                                | NAD+ required for conversion
                                |
                           Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH)
```

**Evidence for IDH Block during Aging:**
*   Metabolites upstream of IDH, including isocitrate, cis-aconitate, and citrate, increase during aging.
*   **Study Data (97-year-olds vs. 67-year-olds):**
    *   Citrate: 39% higher in older group, statistically significant.
    *   Cis-Aconitate: 49% higher in older group, statistically significant.
    *   Isocitrate: 42% higher in older group, statistically significant.

**Hypothesis: Age-Related NAD+ Decline Impacts TCA Cycle Metabolites**
*   The conversion of isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate requires NAD+.
*   As NAD+ declines with age, the efficiency of this reaction may decrease, leading to the accumulation of isocitrate and its upstream metabolites.

## Pyruvate and NAD+

Pyruvate levels also increase during aging, potentially indicating reduced NAD+ availability.

**Study Data (97-year-olds vs. 67-year-olds):**
*   Pyruvate: 13% higher in older group, statistically significant.

**Mechanism:**
*   The conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA requires pyruvate dehydrogenase, which uses NAD+ as a cofactor.
*   Low NAD+ can lead to suboptimal conversion, resulting in pyruvate accumulation.

## Glutamate's Role and NAD+

Glutamate can be converted into 2-oxoglutarate, potentially bypassing an age-related block at IDH.

**Reaction:**
Glutamate (Glutamic Acid) + NAD+ + H2O -> 2-Oxoglutarate (Alpha-Ketoglutarate) + NADH + NH3 (catalyzed by Glutamate Dehydrogenase)

**Implication of Low NAD+:**
*   If NAD+ levels are low, the conversion of glutamate to 2-oxoglutarate is less efficient, leading to an accumulation of glutamate.
*   **Study Data (97-year-olds vs. 67-year-olds):**
    *   Glutamate: 9% higher in older group, statistically significant.

**Conclusion:** The increase in glutamate levels during aging is consistent with low NAD+ and TCA cycle dysfunction.

## Histidine and its Connection to Glutamate and NAD+

Histidine is one of four amino acids that can be converted into glutamate to help compensate for potential TCA cycle blocks. The others are arginine, glutamine, and proline.

**Observation:** Histidine levels decline during aging.
*   **Study Data (97-year-olds vs. 67-year-olds):**
    *   Histidine: 9% lower in older group, statistically significant.

**Hypothesis:**
*   **Low NAD+ and Increased Histidine Degradation:** If NAD+ is low, there may be increased degradation of histidine into glutamate to try and bypass the TCA cycle block.
*   **High NAD+ and High Histidine:** Conversely, with high NAD+ levels, the need for this conversion is reduced, leading to higher histidine levels.

**Significance:** Low histidine could therefore be a marker of both low NAD+ and TCA cycle dysfunction.

## Tracking and Optimizing Metabolite Levels

The iOLO's At Home Metabolomics Kit can be used to track certain metabolites relevant to aging and NAD+ status.

**Metabolites Trackable with iOLO Kit (Current):**
*   Histidine
*   Glutamate
*   Aconitate

**Metabolites Planned for Future Inclusion in iOLO Kit:**
*   Citrate
*   Isocitrate
*   Pyruvate

**Goals for Metabolite Levels:**
*   **Histidine:** Avoid age-related decrease (goal: maintain youthful levels).
*   **Citrate, Isocitrate, Pyruvate, Glutamate, Aconitate:** Avoid age-related increase (goal: maintain youthful levels, indicative of adequate NAD+).

**Personal Data (Two Tests):**
*   **Histidine:** Relatively consistent between tests (76.5 µM and 79 µM).
*   **Glutamate:** Relatively consistent between tests (128 µM and 119 µM).
*   **Aconitate:** Relatively consistent between tests.

**Third iOLO Test (Late July):**
*   NAD+ levels were approximately 2-fold higher than baseline (59 µM vs. 25 µM without supplements) due to niacin and tryptophan supplementation.
*   Results of metabolite changes with elevated NAD+ are pending.
