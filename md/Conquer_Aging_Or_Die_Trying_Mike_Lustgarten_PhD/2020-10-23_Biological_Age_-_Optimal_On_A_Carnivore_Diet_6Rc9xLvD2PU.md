# 2020-10-23 Biological Age - Optimal On A Carnivore Diet

## Executive Summary

*   Phenotypic age, a biological age calculator based on nine common blood biomarkers and chronological age, shows a strong correlation with actual chronological age (0.94-0.96).
*   An older phenotypic age is significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk (9% increase per year older) and higher disease-specific mortality for conditions like heart disease, cancer, and respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19.
*   Analysis of Paul Saladino, MD's blood test data while on a carnivore diet revealed a phenotypic age of 39.59 years, which is 3.4 years younger than his chronological age.
*   While some of his biomarkers (Glucose, Creatinine, MCV, Lymphocyte Percentage, White Blood Cells) were within or near optimal ranges, others (Albumin, C-Reactive Protein, Red Blood Cell Distribution Width, Alkaline Phosphatase) were suboptimal, suggesting room for improvement in his biological age.
*   Optimizing individual biomarkers through dietary and lifestyle adjustments, rather than adhering to a strict dietary approach, may lead to a greater reduction in biological age.

## Introduction to Phenotypic Age

The biological age calculator, known as Levine's phenotypic age, comprises nine blood biomarkers and chronological age. These biomarkers include: albumin, creatinine, glucose, C-reactive protein, percentage of lymphocytes, mean red cell volume, red cell distribution width, alkaline phosphatase, and white blood cell count.

The combination of these nine biomarkers and age has been shown to predict chronological age with a very strong linear correlation (0.94) in the NHANES III study. This correlation was replicated with an even stronger correlation of 0.96 in the NHANES IV cohort. This indicates that these commonly measured blood biomarkers, when combined with age, are highly indicative of an individual's chronological age.

## Phenotypic Age and Mortality Risk

An older biological age, as assessed by Levine's phenotypic age calculator, is significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk. For every one-year increase in biological age, the all-cause mortality risk increases by 9%. This finding is consistent across different age groups, with young adults experiencing a 13% increase, middle-aged adults a 10% increase, and older adults an 8% increase in all-cause mortality risk for each year of older biological age.

Furthermore, an older biological age is associated with a higher mortality risk for specific diseases, including:
*   Heart disease
*   Cancer
*   Chronic respiratory disease
*   Diabetes
*   Influenza or pneumonia
*   Kidney-related issues (nephritis or nephrosis)

Notably, an older biological age was significantly associated with an increased risk for mortality from chronic lower respiratory disease and influenza or pneumonia. Recent preprint data also indicates that an older biological age, as assessed by this calculator, is associated with an increased risk for all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients.

## Analysis of Biomarkers for Optimal Biological Age

To achieve an optimal biological age, it's crucial to understand the optimal ranges for each of the nine phenotypic age biomarkers. This section analyzes how these biomarkers change with aging and their association with all-cause mortality risk, providing context for Paul Saladino's data on a carnivore diet. Paul Saladino's blood test data, analyzed for phenotypic age, resulted in a score of 39.59 years, which is 3.4 years younger than his chronological age. For comparison, a different individual (the speaker) with a chronological age of 47 had an average biological age 11 years younger than his chronological age in 2020. This suggests Paul's biological age could be further optimized.

### Albumin

*   **Aging Trend:** Albumin levels peak in youth for both men and women and then decline during aging. The reference range is 3.5 to 5.0 g/L.
*   **Mortality Risk:** In studies with over a million subjects, the lowest risk for all-cause mortality in men and women is associated with albumin levels of 4.5 g/L and 4.4 g/L, respectively. All-cause mortality risk increases in both genders with lower levels of albumin, regardless of age. Higher levels, closer to 5.0 g/L (found in youth), appear ideal.
*   **Paul's Data:** 4.1 g/L. This level, when extrapolated on aging curves, aligns with albumin levels typically seen in a 75-year-old, indicating it is not optimal.

### Creatinine

*   **Aging Trend:** Creatinine levels increase during aging. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function, uses creatinine in its formula and declines with age, meaning creatinine levels rise with age.
*   **Mortality Risk:** Analysis of all-cause mortality risk in over 30,000 subjects shows that the lowest risk was around 0.8 mg/dL. Risk significantly increases at levels below and above this value. The reference range is 0.76 to 1.27 mg/dL. Creatinine levels also indicate muscle mass.
*   **Paul's Data:** 0.98 mg/dL. Given his higher muscle mass compared to the average person, this level is considered not too far from optimal, as increased muscle mass can elevate creatinine.

### Glucose

*   **Aging Trend:** For both men and women, fasting glucose levels are in the mid-eighties in youth (around 20 years old) and increase during aging to 100 mg/dL or greater.
*   **Mortality Risk:** Glucose levels between 80-94 mg/dL are associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk, with risk increasing for values lower than 80 mg/dL or greater than 95 mg/dL.
*   **Paul's Data:** 87 mg/dL, which is within the optimal range.

### C-Reactive Protein (CRP)

*   **Aging Trend:** C-reactive protein (CRP) levels increase during aging. For women, CRP levels triple from young adulthood to 85 years old. For men, CRP levels increase by 5.4-fold over the same period. Lower levels are considered better.
*   **Mortality Risk:** Numerous studies show lower CRP is associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk. While some studies suggest less than 3 mg/L is acceptable, others indicate less than 1 mg/L, or even 0.5-0.8 mg/L. Four studies have shown that CRP levels less than 0.33 mg/L are associated with a maximally reduced all-cause mortality rate.
*   **Paul's Data:** 1.7 mg/L. Based on aggregated data, this is considered suboptimal; achieving levels closer to 0 mg/L may be optimal.

### Lymphocyte Percentage

*   **Aging Trend:** The percentage of lymphocytes starts between 27-29% in youth for both men and women. For men, lymphocyte percentage consistently declines during aging, from around 28% in their twenties to 18% in their nineties. For women, the percentage declines to about 35 years old, increases until 55-60 years old, and then declines again. In general, older individuals have a lower lymphocyte percentage compared to younger individuals.
*   **Mortality Risk:** Data on lymphocyte percentage and all-cause mortality risk is limited.
*   **Paul's Data:** 26.8%. This value is close to the levels observed in youth (27-29%).

### Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)

*   **Aging Trend:** MCV levels significantly increase with age, rising from approximately 89 fL in young adults to 91-93 fL in older individuals. Lower MCV values are typically found in young adults.
*   **Mortality Risk:** In a study of 36,000 subjects, having higher MCV levels (e.g., greater than 95.8 fL in men or 94 fL in women) is associated with a higher all-cause mortality risk. Optimal ranges for lowest risk were identified (e.g., 90.5-93 fL for men, 89.2-91.6 fL for women).
*   **Paul's Data:** 83.7 fL. This value falls into the lowest quartile of MCV measurements and is not significantly different from the lowest risk groups, suggesting it is optimal.

### Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW)

*   **Definition:** RDW measures the variability in the size of red blood cells. A lower RDW indicates red blood cells are uniform in size, while a higher RDW indicates greater variability (i.e., some large, some small red blood cells).
*   **Aging Trend:** RDW increases during aging, trending from around 12% to 14% or greater in older adults.
*   **Mortality Risk:**
    *   In a study of approximately 30,000 subjects, the lowest all-cause mortality risk was found for RDW values of 9.7-12%.
    *   In a larger study of over 240,000 subjects, an RDW less than 12.5% was associated with the lowest risk. RDW values of 13.4% were associated with a 19% higher risk of all-cause mortality.
    *   In an even larger study of 3.2 million subjects, an RDW of 8.1-12.5% was associated with the lowest risk, while values greater than 13.1% were associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Paul's Data:** 13.4%. Based on this data, Paul's RDW is not optimal and is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.

### Alkaline Phosphatase

*   **Aging Trend:** Alkaline phosphatase levels increase during aging.
*   **Mortality Risk:** In a study of 8.9 million subjects, the relative risk for all-cause mortality increases significantly for alkaline phosphatase concentrations higher than approximately 50 U/L. Values higher than 50 U/L were associated with a higher all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Paul's Data:** 89 U/L. This level is associated with approximately a two-fold higher all-cause mortality risk based on his alkaline phosphatase data, indicating room for improvement.

### White Blood Cells (WBC)

*   **Aging Trend:** Data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging shows that white blood cell counts begin to increase approximately 22 years before death and continue to rise until the end of life.
*   **Mortality Risk:** The reference range for WBC is 3.4-10.8 x 10^3 cells/µL. However, studies on life expectancy indicate that a range of 3.5-6.0 x 10^3 cells/µL is associated with the longest life expectancy. Higher levels (6.0-10.0 x 10^3 cells/µL) were associated with a shorter life expectancy by about eight years, and levels greater than 10.0 x 10^3 cells/µL were associated with a ten-year shorter life expectancy. The shortest life expectancy was observed in the group with less than 3.5 x 10^3 cells/µL.
*   **Paul's Data:** 5.1 x 10^3 cells/µL, which falls within the optimal range for the longest life expectancy.

## Summary of Paul Saladino, MD's Biomarkers on a Carnivore Diet

Based on the analysis of his blood test results, Paul Saladino's biological age is 3.4 years younger than his chronological age. His biomarkers show a mix of optimal and suboptimal levels:

*   **Biomarkers within or near optimal range:**
    *   Glucose (87 mg/dL)
    *   Creatinine (0.98 mg/dL, considering muscle mass)
    *   Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) (83.7 fL)
    *   Lymphocyte Percentage (26.8%)
    *   White Blood Cells (5.1 x 10^3 cells/µL)

*   **Biomarkers that can be improved:**
    *   Albumin (4.1 g/L)
    *   C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (1.7 mg/L)
    *   Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) (13.4%)
    *   Alkaline Phosphatase (89 U/L)

## Conclusion

While following a carnivore diet, Paul Saladino's biological age is younger than his chronological age. However, analysis of specific biomarkers suggests that further optimization is possible. Adjusting dietary components, perhaps incorporating elements beyond a strict carnivore diet, could potentially improve the suboptimal biomarker levels and lead to an even lower biological age. The approach to health optimization should be dictated by biomarker data to achieve the best individual outcomes.
