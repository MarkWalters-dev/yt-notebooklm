# 2024-10-27 Fasting Without Calorie Restriction And Calorie Restriction With Fasting Extend Lifespan

## Executive Summary

*   Fasting for one or two days per week, even without calorie restriction, can extend median lifespan in mice.
*   Calorie restriction (CR) also extends lifespan, with a 40% CR group showing the largest median lifespan increase.
*   The 40% CR group also maintained physical activity (wheel running) better with age, resisting age-related decline.
*   Higher lymphocyte levels at 16 months of age in mice are strongly correlated with longer lifespan.
*   Higher Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) at 10 months of age in mice is strongly correlated with shorter lifespan.

## Mouse Data

### Study Design and Groups

A study was conducted using 960 Little (dwarf) mice, with 192 mice per group. Interventions began at six months of age. The five groups were:

*   **Ad Libitum (Ad Lib):** Mice could eat as much as they wanted, whenever they wanted.
*   **One Day of Fasting:** Mice fasted for half a day on Wednesday and half a day on Thursday (one day per week).
*   **Two Days of Fasting:** Mice fasted from midday Wednesday through midday Friday (two days per week).
*   **20% Calorie Restriction (CR) with One Day of Fasting:**
    *   Mice consumed 20% less food than Ad Lib from Monday through Thursday.
    *   They received three days' worth of food on Friday and ate it on Friday and Saturday, fasting on Sunday.
*   **40% Calorie Restriction (CR):**
    *   Mice consumed 40% less food than Ad Lib from Monday through Thursday.
    *   They received three days' worth of food on Friday but ate it all on Friday, fasting on Saturday and Sunday.

### Lifespan Extension

The study measured median lifespan, defined as the age at which half the colony has died.

*   **One Day of Fasting (no CR):** This group showed an increased median lifespan comparable to calorie-restricted groups. Food intake in this group was actually slightly higher (2.5% more) than the Ad Lib group.
*   **Two Days of Fasting:** This group ended up consuming 11.5% less food than the Ad Lib group and also showed a similar magnitude of lifespan extension as the one day of fasting group.
*   **20% CR:** This group showed a further increase in median lifespan. Actual food intake was 27.1% less than Ad Lib.
*   **40% CR:** This group exhibited the largest increase in median lifespan, a 36% improvement. Actual food consumed was approximately 44% less than Ad Lib.

### Physical Activity (Wheel Running)

*   Prior to the study onset (at five months of age), all groups ran similar distances on their wheels.
*   With aging, all groups except the 40% CR group showed a decline in daily wheel running.
*   The 40% CR group resisted this age-related decline, maintaining higher levels of physical activity throughout their lifespan.

### Biomarker Correlations with Lifespan

The study analyzed various biomarkers to identify those correlated with lifespan, independent of group assignment.

*   **Lymphocyte Levels (at 16 months of age):** Higher lymphocyte levels were significantly correlated with a longer lifespan.
*   **Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) (at 10 months of age):** A higher RDW was significantly correlated with a shorter lifespan. RDW measures the variability in red blood cell volume; a high RDW indicates a mix of small and large red blood cells.

## Human Evidence

The findings in mice were mirrored by evidence in human populations.

### Lymphocyte Counts and Mortality Risk

*   **Hazard Ratio for All-Cause Mortality vs. Lymphocyte Count:**
    *   The lowest risk of death was observed at lymphocyte counts around 2 x 10^9 cells per liter (2,000 cells per microliter).
    *   Lymphocyte counts typically decline with aging.
    *   Relatively lower lymphocyte levels are associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, aligning with the mouse data.

### RDW and Mortality Risk

*   **RDW (%) vs. All-Cause Mortality Risk:**
    *   A hazard ratio of 1.0 indicates no increased risk. Values to the right of 1.0 signify increased risk.
    *   RDW values greater than 13.7% are significantly associated with an increased risk of death from all causes.
    *   The lowest risk of death is associated with RDW values between 11.4% and 12.5%.
    *   RDW generally increases with aging.
    *   **Exception:** Extremely low RDW values (less than 11.4%) can also be associated with increased mortality risk, though this occurs very infrequently.
