# 2024-12-18 Red Light Therapy Improves Eye Function - Glen Jeffery PhD

## Executive Summary

*   A single 3-minute burst of red light significantly improves visual threshold in humans.
*   This improvement, observed 3 hours post-exposure, represents a 17% increase in the ability to detect degraded letters.
*   The effect is more pronounced for blue light detection, a visual channel more vulnerable to aging and conditions like diabetes or macular degeneration.
*   The benefits of a single red light exposure typically last for about one week across various species (e.g., flies, bumblebees, humans, mice).
*   The optimal exposure duration appears to be short (e.g., 2-15 minutes), suggesting red light acts as a "switch" to initiate a beneficial process rather than requiring prolonged application.

## Human Evidence

### Retinal Mitochondria & Aging Background

The retina, particularly photoreceptors, contains more mitochondria than any other part of the body and ages rapidly. This makes it a prime target for interventions aimed at mitochondrial function.

### Study Methodology

*   Participants were asked to identify a degraded (fuzzy) letter presented in either blue or red light.
*   The 'threshold' (the level of degradation at which the letter could be accurately detected) was measured as a baseline.
*   A single 3-minute burst of red light was administered.
*   Visual thresholds were retested 3 hours after the red light exposure.
*   A follow-up retest was conducted one week later.

### Results & Efficacy

*   Three hours after a 3-minute red light exposure, participants showed a significant improvement in visual threshold compared to baseline measurements. This indicates an improved ability to detect degraded letters, meaning objects could be detected more easily.
*   Across the study population, there was a 17% overall improvement in visual threshold.
*   This improvement was slightly stronger for the blue channel of vision compared to the red. The blue visual channel is typically frailer and more susceptible to age-related decline, as well as conditions like diabetes and macular degeneration.

### Duration of Effect & Dosage

*   The beneficial effects of a single 3-minute red light burst last approximately one week.
*   One week post-exposure, the improvement was still significant but reduced to around 10% and 8% in a follow-up study with fewer subjects, down from the initial 17% observed at 3 hours.
*   Exposure durations ranging from 2 minutes to 15 minutes yield pretty much the same results. This suggests that red light acts like a "switch" that is turned on rather than requiring prolonged, continuous application.
