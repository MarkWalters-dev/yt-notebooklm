# 2024-07-14 Telomere Length Test 15 - Correlations With Diet

## Executive Summary

*   Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) naturally declines with age, with average lengths decreasing from approximately 7.75 kilobases in youth to around 5 kilobases in centenarians.
*   Personal data over 15 telomere length tests shows fluctuations, with recent readings indicating room for improvement to reach youthful levels.
*   Dietary intake of cloves, broccoli, calcium, and onions is significantly correlated with longer telomere length in personal data.
*   Dietary intake of trimethylglycine, a higher omega-6 to omega-3 ratio, zinc, and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) is significantly correlated with shorter telomere length in personal data.
*   An experimental approach is being used to optimize telomere length by adjusting dietary intake based on these correlations and re-evaluating them over time.

## Telomere Length Decline With Age

Telomere shortening is a hallmark of aging and negatively impacts other hallmarks, including genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, and stem cell exhaustion.

*   Telomere length declines with age in both men and women.
*   Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in white blood cells, plotted against age from 20 to 100 years, shows a consistent decline.
*   Average LTL in youth is around 7.75 kilobases.
*   In advanced age, closer to 100 years old, LTL averages around 5 kilobases.

## Personal Telomere Length Data

Personal telomere length data collected over 15 tests since 2022 reveals trends and areas for improvement.

*   **2022 (3 tests):** Average telomere length was 7.05 kilobases.
*   **2023 (8 tests):** Average telomere length was 7.13 kilobases. This period likely represents a more comprehensive yearly average due to a higher number of tests.
*   **2024 (thus far):** Average telomere length is 7.12 kilobases.
*   **Recent Trend (last five tests):** Three of the last five tests showed telomere lengths of 7.06 and 7.08 kilobases, which are closer to the 2022 data. The most recent test (May 28, 2024) was 7.07 kilobases.
*   **Interpretation:** The recent data suggests there is significant room for improvement to reach the youthful average of 7.75 kilobases.

## Methodology for Correlation Analysis

A systematic approach is used to identify dietary factors correlated with telomere length.

*   **Dietary Tracking:**
    *   Weighing all food with a food scale since 2015.
    *   Entering daily food amounts into Cronometer.
    *   Manually entering Cronometer data into a spreadsheet.
*   **Biomarker Correlation:**
    *   Each blood test date corresponds to the average dietary intake for a preceding period (e.g., 50 days).
    *   This average dietary intake is then used to calculate correlations with telomere length and other biomarkers.
*   **Analysis Performed:** 97 comparisons were made between telomere length and various foods, macronutrients, and micronutrients.

## Significant Correlations With Telomere Length

The analysis identified several dietary factors significantly correlated with telomere length (p-value < 0.05).

**Correlated with Longer Telomere Length:**

*   **Cloves:** Correlation coefficient (r) of 0.7. Higher intake is associated with longer telomeres.
*   **Broccoli**
*   **Calcium**
*   **Salt**
*   **Onions**

**Correlated with Shorter Telomere Length:**

*   **Trimethylglycine (dietary intake):** This is tracked independently, not solely via Cronometer, as a methyl donor.
*   **Omega-6 to Omega-3 Ratio:** Personal ratio is consistently less than 2:1.
*   **Zinc**
*   **Saturated Fatty Acids (SFAs)**

## Experimental Approach to Optimize Telomere Length

The identified correlations are being used to experimentally optimize telomere length.

*   **Goal:** To increase telomere length by following dietary correlations associated with longer telomeres and reducing those associated with shorter telomeres.
*   **Recent Adjustments (for next test):**
    *   **Increased Intake:** Cloves, broccoli, calcium, and onions.
    *   **Reduced Intake:** Saturated fatty acids, primarily from coconut butter.
*   **Future Evaluation:**
    *   After the next retest, correlations will be recalculated.
    *   Spurious correlations are expected to weaken if the dietary changes do not lead to corresponding changes in telomere length, suggesting they are not directly involved in the underlying mechanisms.
    *   Correlations that persist and strengthen may indicate a more direct causal relationship.
    *   This process will be repeated over time to refine understanding and optimize telomere length.

The next telomere length test is scheduled for approximately two weeks from the transcript date, with an update video expected in September.
