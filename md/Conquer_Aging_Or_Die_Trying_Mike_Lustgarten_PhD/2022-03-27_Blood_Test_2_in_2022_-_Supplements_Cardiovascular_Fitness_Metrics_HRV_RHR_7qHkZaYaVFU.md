# 2022-03-27 Blood Test 2 in 2022 - Supplements Cardiovascular Fitness Metrics HRV RHR

## Executive Summary

*   **Cardiovascular Metrics Improvement:** Blood Test 2 period showed a statistically significant increase in Heart Rate Variability (HRV) (51 ms to 55.7 ms) and a significant decrease in Resting Heart Rate (RHR) (47 bpm to 45 bpm) compared to Blood Test 1 period.
*   **Body Weight Correlation:** Lower body weight was significantly correlated with higher HRV and lower RHR, suggesting a contribution to improved cardiovascular metrics.
*   **Physical Activity Impact:** Excessive daily physical activity (higher average daily heart rate) was correlated with lower HRV and higher RHR, indicating a need for balance between activity and recovery.
*   **Melatonin Supplementation:** Melatonin was a relatively new addition for Blood Test 2, with an average intake of 194 µg/day for the 49-day period.
*   **Biological Age Discrepancy:** Despite improvements in cardiovascular metrics, biological age assessments showed a slight worsening for Blood Test 2 compared to Blood Test 1.

## Supplements

The following supplements were being taken during the period corresponding to Blood Test 2:

*   **Levothyroxine:** 137.5 µg daily (taken for over 20 years due to diagnosed hypothyroidism).
*   **Vitamin D:** 1,000 IU daily (supplemented during winter).
*   **Methyl B12:** Once every three days (to manage homocysteine levels).
*   **Melatonin:** Average intake of 194 µg/day for the 49-day period leading up to Blood Test 2. This was a more consistent intake compared to the period leading up to Blood Test 1.

## Cardiovascular Metrics (HRV & RHR)

### Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

*   **Test 1 Period (12/13/2021 - 01/2022, 42 days):**
    *   Average HRV: ~51 milliseconds
*   **Test 2 Period (01/24/2022 - 03/13/2022, 49 days):**
    *   Average HRV: 55.7 milliseconds
*   **Comparison:** A two-sample t-test indicated a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05), with HRV being significantly higher during the Test 2 period.

### Resting Heart Rate (RHR)

*   **Test 1 Period (42 days):**
    *   Average RHR: ~47 beats per minute (bpm)
*   **Test 2 Period (49 days):**
    *   Average RHR: ~45 bpm
*   **Comparison:** A two-sample t-test indicated a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05), with RHR being significantly lower during the Test 2 period.

### Age-Related Cardiovascular Data Context

*   **Resting Heart Rate and Aging:** Average resting heart rate increases from age 20 to 50 and then declines through age 85 for both men and women. A low RHR of 62 bpm can be seen in 20-year-olds and 70-year-olds.
*   **Heart Rate Variability and Aging:** Heart Rate Variability (measured by RMSSD) declines with age. Values approach 80 in 20-year-olds and 40 in 60-year-olds. Youth is characterized by low RHR and high HRV, while older age can have low RHR and low HRV.
*   **Individual HRV Context:** The average HRV of 55.7 ms during Test 2 could correspond to the median value for someone approximately 19 years younger. It also falls within the higher end of the HRV range for the individual's chronological age.

## Factors Influencing Cardiovascular Metrics

### Body Weight

*   **Test 1 Period:** Average body weight: 154 lbs
*   **Test 2 Period:** Average body weight: 153.4 lbs
*   **Comparison:** A two-sample t-test showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05), with a lower average daily body weight during the Test 2 period.

*   **HRV vs. Body Weight (August 2018 - March 2022, >1300 days):**
    *   An inverse, statistically significant correlation was observed (p < 0.05). As body weight increases, HRV decreases. Approaching 150 lbs, HRV approaches 60 ms.
*   **RHR vs. Body Weight (August 2018 - March 2022, >1300 days):**
    *   A positive, statistically significant correlation was observed (p < 0.05). As body weight increases, RHR increases. Approaching 150 lbs, RHR approaches 45 bpm.

### Physical Activity

*   **Average Daily Heart Rate (ADHR) as an Index of Daily Activity:**
    *   **Test 1 Period:** Average ADHR: 57 bpm
    *   **Test 2 Period:** Average ADHR: 56.2 bpm
    *   **Comparison:** The difference between Test 1 and Test 2 was not statistically significant (p close to, but > 0.05). This suggests that daily physical activity levels did not significantly contribute to the improvements in HRV and RHR.

*   **HRV vs. Average Daily Heart Rate (April 2020 - March 2022):**
    *   A statistically significant inverse correlation was observed. Higher ADHR (more daily activity) correlated with lower HRV.
*   **RHR vs. Average Daily Heart Rate (April 2020 - March 2022):**
    *   A statistically significant positive correlation was observed. Higher ADHR (more daily activity) correlated with higher RHR.

*   **Optimal Activity Level:** Maintaining an average daily heart rate between 55-60 bpm appears to optimize both RHR and HRV. Excessive activity too often can lead to suboptimal cardiovascular metrics. Balancing active days with rest days is crucial for recovery and optimal cardiovascular fitness.

## Biological Age Discrepancy

*   **Levine's Phenotypic Age Calculator:**
    *   Test 1: 16.4 years younger than chronological age.
    *   Test 2: Biological age slightly worsened.
*   **Aging.ai:**
    *   Test 1: 23 years younger than chronological age.
    *   Test 2: Approximately 2 years older than chronological age.

This indicates that despite improved cardiovascular metrics in Test 2, biological age assessments showed a less favorable outcome compared to Test 1.
