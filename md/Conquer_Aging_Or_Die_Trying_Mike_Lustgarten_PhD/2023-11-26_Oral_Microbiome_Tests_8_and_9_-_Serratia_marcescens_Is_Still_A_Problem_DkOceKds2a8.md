# 2023-11-26 Oral Microbiome Tests 8 and 9 - Serratia marcescens Is Still A Problem

## Executive Summary

*   *Serratia marcescens* significantly dominates the oral microbiome, appearing at levels ranging from 88% to 96% in five out of nine tests, despite occasional zero readings.
*   Dietary interventions aimed at reducing *Serratia* (modifying intake of mushrooms, yogurt, onion, protein) and a specific cardamom supplementation for Tests 8 and 9 were ineffective, with *Serratia* levels remaining around 95-96%.
*   Early tests (Tests 1-5) which included various formulations of a homemade mouthwash (xylitol, sodium bicarbonate, peppermint oil, sometimes with potassium nitrate or clove oil) showed a significantly lower average *Serratia* presence (~45%) compared to later tests (Tests 6-9) where the mouthwash was absent or significantly modified (~95.5%).
*   The original homemade mouthwash formulation (xylitol, sodium bicarbonate, peppermint oil) showed varied results, including two instances of 0% *Serratia* when combined with potassium nitrate and clove oil, suggesting its potential efficacy.
*   For Test 10, the strategy is to return to the original homemade mouthwash formulation, with consideration for reintroducing potassium nitrate.

## The Challenge of *Serratia marcescens*

*Serratia marcescens* (*Serratia*) is a bacterium linked to several adverse human health conditions, including pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. An analysis of seven oral microbiome tests revealed a significant problem: *Serratia* was zero in two tests, but dominated the oral microbiome in the other five, reaching levels of 88% to 96%. This indicates that almost the entire oral microbiome was overrun by *Serratia* in these instances.

## Test 8: Dietary Correlation Intervention

**Objective:** To decrease *Serratia* levels and increase bacteria inversely correlated with *Serratia* by adjusting dietary intake based on previously observed correlations.

**Identified Foods with Significant Correlation:**
*   Mushrooms, onion, and protein: Higher intake correlated with either lower levels of beneficial bacteria or higher levels of *Serratia*. The strategy was to eat towards the lower end of the intake range for these foods.
*   Yogurt: Higher intake correlated with lower *Serratia* or higher levels of beneficial bacteria. The strategy was to eat towards the higher end of the intake range for this food.

**Protocol for Test 8 (30-day average prior to test):**
*   **Mushrooms:** Average intake was 209 grams per day, aligning with the target of the lower end of the range.
*   **Yogurt:** Average intake was 144 grams per day; for the last 20 days, it was 150 grams, aligning with the target of the higher end of the range.
*   **Onions and Protein:** Intake was maintained towards the lower end of their respective ranges.

**Result of Test 8:**
*   *Serratia* levels were 96% in September 2023, indicating the dietary correlation strategy did not effectively reduce the bacterium.

## Test 9: Cardamom Intervention

**Observation:** On the two prior tests where *Serratia* was 0%, cardamom intake was 2 grams per day, significantly higher than the average of 0.2 grams per day on the five tests where *Serratia* was present.

**Protocol for Test 9:**
*   Consumed 2 grams of cardamom daily for three days, including two days before the test and on the morning of the test.

**Result of Test 9:**
*   *Serratia* levels were 95% in October 2023, indicating the cardamom intervention did not effectively reduce the bacterium.

## Historical Overview of Interventions (Tests 1-9)

To understand patterns and potential effective strategies, a review of previous interventions was conducted. Daily routines for all tests included tooth brushing and string flossing.

*   **Tests 1 & 2: Homemade Mouthwash**
    *   **Protocol:** Used a homemade mouthwash (1% xylitol, 1% sodium bicarbonate, a few drops of peppermint oil in 1 liter of water) 3-5 times per day (after meals and randomly).
    *   **Results:**
        *   Test 1: *Serratia* 88%.
        *   Test 2: *Serratia* 0%.

*   **Test 3: Mouthwash with Potassium Nitrate**
    *   **Protocol:** Added 4 grams per liter of potassium nitrate to the homemade mouthwash. Nitrate is known to act as a prebiotic for the oral microbiome.
    *   **Result:** *Serratia* 41%.

*   **Test 4: Mouthwash with Reduced Potassium Nitrate & Clove Oil**
    *   **Protocol:** Reduced potassium nitrate concentration to 2 grams per liter and added a few drops of clove oil to the homemade mouthwash.
    *   **Result:** *Serratia* 0%.

*   **Test 5: Mouthwash with Berberine**
    *   **Protocol:** Used the base homemade mouthwash formulation (xylitol, sodium bicarbonate, peppermint oil) and added berberine.
    *   **Result:** *Serratia* 95%.

*   **Test 6: No Homemade Mouthwash**
    *   **Protocol:** No homemade mouthwash used. Water was used after meals and for random swishing throughout the day. Waterpik and tongue scraping were also included.
    *   **Result:** *Serratia* 95%.

*   **Test 7: High Xylitol Mouthwash**
    *   **Protocol:** Used a modified homemade mouthwash with 5% xylitol (based on *in vitro* studies showing high concentrations of xylitol can reduce *Serratia* by ~80%), but no bicarbonate or peppermint oil. Used 3-5 times per day.
    *   **Result:** *Serratia* 96%.

*   **Test 8: Dietary Correlations** (As detailed above)
    *   **Result:** *Serratia* 96%.

*   **Test 9: Cardamom Intervention** (As detailed above)
    *   **Result:** *Serratia* 95%.

## Analysis of Overall Trends

Comparing the first five tests (average *Serratia* levels approximately 45%) with the last four tests (average *Serratia* levels approximately 95.5%) reveals a significant difference (p < 0.05, two-sample t-test). The lower *Serratia* levels in the initial tests suggest that some formulation of the homemade mouthwash may have played a role in reducing the bacterium.

## Plan for Test 10

Based on the analysis, the strategy for Test 10 will focus on reintroducing the mouthwash.
*   **Return to original homemade mouthwash formulation:** Xylitol, sodium bicarbonate, and peppermint oil.
*   **Consideration:** Adding a couple of grams of potassium nitrate to the mouthwash to further explore its potential impact on *Serratia* levels.
