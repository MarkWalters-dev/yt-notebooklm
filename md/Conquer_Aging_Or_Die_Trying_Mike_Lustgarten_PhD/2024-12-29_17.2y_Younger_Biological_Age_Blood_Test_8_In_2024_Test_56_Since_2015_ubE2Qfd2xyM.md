# 2024-12-29 17.2y Younger Biological Age Blood Test 8 In 2024 Test 56 Since 2015

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age calculated using PhenoAge is 34.7 years, which is 17.2 years younger than the chronological age of 51.9 years. This is close to the maximum observed reduction of approximately 20 years.
*   Average annual PhenoAge has remained stable or slightly improved over the past four years (e.g., 35.6 in 2020-2021 to 34.8 in 2024), demonstrating an improvement in biomarkers against an expected age-related increase of 0.9 years per chronological year.
*   Significant improvements include HDL (average 56 mg/dL over 13 tests, up from 45 mg/dL historically) and hsCRP (21 consecutive tests at or below the lab's detection limit of 0.3 mg/L).
*   Identified weak spots for improvement include Homocysteine (10.7 µmol/L), Glucose (95 mg/dL), and thyroid hormones (aged T4/T3 ratio). Interventions for homocysteine (N-Acetylcysteine) and consistent tracking for glucose (with HbA1c) are planned.
*   Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Candida IgG are now being closely monitored due to their associations with aging and lifespan extension in experimental contexts.

## Biological Age Calculation & Trends

The biological age, calculated using Dr. Morgan Levine's PhenoAge, is 34.7 years. This is 17.2 years younger than the chronological age of 51.9 years. The maximum biological age reduction relative to chronological age observed with this test is approximately 20 years.

Tracking biological age since 2018 across 37 tests reveals a stable or improving trend:

*   **2018-2019 (3 tests):** Average PhenoAge 36.1 years.
*   **2020 (6 tests):** Average PhenoAge 35.6 years.
*   **2021 (6 tests):** Average PhenoAge 35.6 years.
*   **2022 (7 tests):** Average PhenoAge 33.8 years (best year).
*   **2023 (7 tests):** Average PhenoAge 34.7 years.
*   **2024 (8 tests):** Average PhenoAge 34.8 years.

Despite chronological aging, the average PhenoAge has been maintained or reduced, indicating an avoidance of age-related biological age increase. The PhenoAge test inherently increases by 0.9 years per year of chronological age if biomarkers remain constant. Based on this, an expected biological age for 2024 would be 39.2 years (35.6 years in 2020 + 0.9 * 4 years), demonstrating that biomarkers have improved over the past four years to achieve the observed 34.8 years.

## Blood Testing Protocol

To obtain these blood test data without needing frequent doctor visits:

*   Select desired tests on altalabtest.com.
*   Print the form for the selected tests.
*   Bring the form to Quest Diagnostics.
*   Pay the blood draw fee.
*   Receive results relatively quickly (most within 15 hours).

For the latest test, blood was drawn around 7:30 AM.

## Key Biomarkers: Highlights and Improvements

*   **HDL:** At 64 mg/dL, it is close to the optimal range (50-60 mg/dL for men, based on all-cause mortality risk). This marks 13 consecutive tests with HDL greater than or equal to 50 mg/dL, with an average of 56 mg/dL over this period. This is an improvement from the previous 43 tests (since 2015), which had an average HDL of 45 mg/dL, including values as low as 28 mg/dL. The improvement is attributed to dietary and lifestyle correlations.
*   **hsCRP:** At 0.2 mg/L, this is the 21st consecutive test at or below the lab's detection limit (0.3 mg/L). HsCRP is a measure of inflammation.
    *   **Future Testing:** To gain a more comprehensive view of inflammation, TNF alpha and IL-6 (pro-inflammatory measures produced by senescent cells) will be included in upcoming tests and potentially all future tests, aiming to keep them relatively low.

## Key Biomarkers: Weak Spots and Interventions

*   **Homocysteine:** At 10.7 µmol/L, it is a weak spot. While within the lab's reference range (< 11.4 µmol/L), optimal levels based on all-cause mortality data are closer to 5 µmol/L. This is not a genetic issue, as levels were around 5-6 µmol/L 20 years ago.
    *   **Prior Interventions (unsuccessful):**
        *   4 grams of Trimethylglycine (TMG) per day.
        *   High dose serine + B6.
        *   High dose methyl folate + B6.
        *   Glycine.
        *   B12 (reduced homocysteine by ~10% but potentially impacted other biomarkers).
    *   **Current Intervention:** N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)
        *   **Dose:** 1 to 1.5 grams per day.
        *   **Start Date:** December 24th.
        *   **Testing:** Will be re-tested after approximately three weeks to assess its effect on homocysteine.
*   **Glucose:** Increased from 90 mg/dL in the last test to 95 mg/dL, which is now outside the optimal range of 80-94 mg/dL (based on all-cause mortality risk). The average glucose over 54 tests since 2015 is 90 mg/dL.
    *   **Future Testing:** HbA1c (last tested in October 2023 at 5.1%) will be included in the January test and all future tests to provide an integrated assessment of long-term glucose levels and metabolic health.

## Kidney Function Markers

Collectively, these three markers suggest youthful and optimal kidney function:

*   **Creatinine:** At 0.87 mg/dL, this is lower than the 56-test average of 0.95 mg/dL. Creatinine levels generally increase with declining kidney function but also decrease with age-related muscle mass loss.
    *   **Future Testing:** Cystatin C, which may be a more reliable measure of kidney function at older ages, will be included in the January test.
*   **Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN):** At 8 mg/dL, this is relatively low. BUN typically increases during aging due to reduced kidney efficiency in removing urea. Low BUN can be associated with increased all-cause mortality risk at advanced ages, potentially linked to liver dysfunction (as urea is produced in the liver). However, considering the healthy liver function markers (see below), this low BUN is interpreted as an indicator of good kidney function.
*   **Uric Acid:** At 3.6 mg/dL, it was flagged as low by the lab, but this level is close to the lowest all-cause mortality risk. Uric acid levels typically increase with declining kidney function. A lower level, therefore, suggests good kidney function.

## Liver Function Markers

Liver health and function appear close to optimal and youthful, supporting the interpretation of low BUN as good kidney function.

*   **Albumin & Alkaline Phosphatase:** Both are youthful and optimal based on all-cause mortality risk.
*   **AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) & ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase):** Levels are in the low twenties, which is optimal (high teens to low twenties). These enzymes follow a J-shaped curve for all-cause mortality, where both too low (e.g., around 15) and increasing values above the optimal range are associated with higher risk.
*   **GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase):** Is on the lower side. GGT is considered a more specific and linearly correlated marker for liver disease mortality, with lower levels being better.

## Immunoglobulins and Aging

*   **Globulins/Immunoglobulin G (IgG):** Globulins refer to a mix of proteins, including immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) constitutes about 44% of the globulin fraction. IgG levels increase during aging. Studies show that interventions improving healthspan and lifespan (e.g., exercise, calorie restriction) lead to lower IgG. Experimentally reducing IgG levels has also been shown to extend median lifespan.
    *   **Future Plans:** IgG will be included in all future tests to track its correlation with other biomarkers and determine an optimal target value.
*   **Candida IgG:** This subdivision of total immunoglobulins has consistently been elevated or just outside the reference range in all seven tests in 2024. This indicates the immune system is actively managing Candida somewhere in the body.
    *   **Interventions:** Rapamycin was tried but did not impact Candida IgG. Dietary adjustments are being explored.

## Thyroid Hormone Function

Thyroid hormone levels present a significant weak spot:

*   **T4 (inactive) & T3 (active):** Both free T4 and free T3 levels appear "aged," more commonly found at older chronological ages.
*   **Free T3 to Free T4 Ratio:** The ratio is 0.18, which is more typical of 90-year-olds than someone in their early 50s. This suggests a worsening conversion of T4 to T3, a common age-related change.
*   **Intervention Considerations:** Given a history of hypothyroidism and atrophy of the thyroid gland, the possibility of switching from prescribed T4 (Levothyroxine) to T3 supplementation is being considered if conversion cannot be improved through other means.

## Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]

*   **Current Level:** 80 nmol/L. Lipoprotein(a) is often flagged as being outside the reference range. While generally considered resistant to dietary, supplemental, or pharmaceutical changes, personal values have decreased from a high of 145 nmol/L to 80 nmol/L through dietary adjustments.
*   **ApoB:** Lipoprotein(a) contains ApoB. At an Lp(a) level of 90 nmol/L (previous test), ApoB was relatively low at 68 mg/dL.
    *   **Future Testing:** ApoB will be measured in the next test to see its level in relation to the lower Lp(a) of 80 nmol/L.

## Other Hematological Markers

*   **Hemoglobin:** At 15.1 g/dL, it is back to youthful status. Hemoglobin levels typically decline during aging. The 2024 average (14.8 g/dL) was slightly lower than the 53-test average since 2015 (15.1 g/dL), indicating a small decrement that is being addressed through dietary/supplemental interventions.
*   **MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume):** At 93.1 fL, this is a current weak spot. MCV (average red blood cell volume) increases during aging, with larger red blood cells found at older ages. While this value is not at the lower end of the personal range (around 89 fL), progress has been made to reduce it from a recent high of 95 fL.
    *   **RDW (Red Cell Distribution Width):** At 11.7%, RDW (variability in red blood cell size) is youthful and associated with low all-cause mortality risk. A youthful RDW alleviates concern regarding the elevated MCV.
*   **Neutrophils:** At 1778, this is outside the optimal range of 2000-3000 (for all-cause mortality risk). The 2024 average was 1972. While lower than optimal, being closer to 2000 is preferred due to the pro-inflammatory nature of neutrophils.
*   **DHEA Sulfate:** At 128 µg/dL, DHEA sulfate declines during aging. Historical values were higher (~300 µg/dL, possibly due to prior DHEA supplementation). The current level is close to the 18-test average of 125 µg/dL over the past 28 months, suggesting resistance to further age-related decline over this period. While a higher value might be desirable, maintaining stability against age-related decline is considered a positive outcome.
