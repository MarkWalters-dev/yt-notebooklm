# 2021-07-17 NMN Improves Aerobic Capacity in Runners

## Executive Summary

*   A 6-week study in amateur runners showed that Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation had an additive effect on improving several aerobic capacity metrics when combined with exercise training.
*   Specifically, NMN significantly improved heart rate, oxygen consumption rate (VO2), power output at the first ventilatory threshold (VT1), and power output at the second ventilatory threshold (VT2).
*   NMN supplementation did not affect maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max), body composition, or cardiopulmonary function metrics (max heart rate, heart rate reserve, max ventilation).
*   NMN did show an additive effect on the single-leg stand test, a measure of muscle function, particularly at the medium dose.
*   The study suggests that NMN's additive benefits on aerobic capacity may be linked to changes in muscle function rather than direct cardiac or pulmonary effects.

## Study Design and Methodology

This study investigated the additive effect of NMN supplementation on exercise performance in amateur runners.

### Participants

*   **Age:** 27 to 50 years old (average 36 years).
*   **BMI:** Average 22 (normal range).
*   **Subjects:** 48 participants (40 men, 8 women).

### Groups and NMN Dosing

Participants were equally divided into four groups (10 men, 2 women per group):

1.  **Control Group:** Given cranberry powder and maltodextrin.
2.  **Low-dose NMN Group:** 300 mg NMN per day.
3.  **Medium-dose NMN Group:** 600 mg NMN per day.
4.  **High-dose NMN Group:** 1,200 mg NMN per day.

### Exercise Training Protocol

All four groups performed 6 weeks of aerobic exercise training:

*   **Frequency:** 5 to 6 days per week.
*   **Running:** 3 to 4 days per week.
*   **Biking:** 2 days per week.
*   **Duration:** 40 to 60 minutes per session.

## Baseline Fitness Level of Participants

The study's amateur runners had an average resting heart rate of 67-68 beats per minute. This is comparable to the median resting heart rate of approximately 70 beats per minute for individuals aged 27-50 in the general population. This indicates that the participants had relatively average cardiovascular fitness for their age, confirming they were not elite athletes.

## NMN and Aerobic Capacity Metrics

Six weeks of exercise training improved five metrics of aerobic capacity across all groups. NMN supplementation had an *additive effect* on improving these five metrics compared to controls.

The maximal aerobic exercise capacity test assesses a progression from rest to exhaustion, identifying two key ventilatory thresholds (VT1 and VT2) before reaching VO2 max.

### Ventilatory Threshold 1 (VT1)

VT1 is the point during exercise where breathing rate begins to increase. NMN supplementation improved four metrics at VT1:

*   **Change in Heart Rate (HR) at VT1:**
    *   High-dose NMN group achieved a significantly higher heart rate compared to the control group and the low-dose NMN group.
    *   *Interpretation:* A higher heart rate at VT1 allows for greater oxygen and nutrient delivery for metabolic work, potentially enabling greater distance or power output.
*   **Rate of Oxygen Consumption (VO2) at VT1:**
    *   Medium and High-dose NMN groups showed a higher VO2 compared to the control group.
    *   High-dose NMN group also had a higher VO2 compared to the low-dose NMN group.
*   **Change in Power at VT1 (Cycling Test):**
    *   Medium and High-dose NMN groups demonstrated greater power (cycled for a longer distance) compared to the control group.
    *   High-dose NMN group exhibited greater power compared to both low and medium-dose NMN groups.
*   **Percent Change in Maximal Rate of Oxygen Consumption (Percent VO2 max) at VT1:**
    *   High-dose NMN group performed better compared to the control group.
    *   High-dose NMN group performed better compared to the low-dose NMN group.

### Ventilatory Threshold 2 (VT2)

VT2 is the point where breathing rate increases to the extent that the person is out of breath.

*   **Change in Power at VT2:**
    *   Low and High-dose NMN groups had a higher change in power compared to the control group.

### Maximal Oxygen Consumption (VO2 max)

VO2 max represents exercising to exhaustion.

*   **NMN did not affect VO2 max.**

## NMN and Body Composition

The study examined changes in body mass, BMI, fat-free mass (a proxy for whole-body muscle mass), and body fat percentage.

*   Exercise training alone did not significantly change these body composition metrics.
*   NMN supplementation did not show an additive effect on body mass or composition when compared to the exercise effect or control group (P > 0.05).

## Investigating Mechanisms: Cardiopulmonary vs. Skeletal Muscle

The authors investigated whether NMN's additive effect on aerobic capacity was related to cardiopulmonary (heart and lungs) or skeletal muscle function.

### Cardiopulmonary Metrics

Measures included:

*   Change in maximum heart rate.
*   Change in heart rate reserve (maximum heart rate - resting heart rate).
*   Maximum ventilation during exercise (VE max, in liters of air consumed per minute).

*   While exercise may have affected these variables, NMN supplementation showed **no additive effect** on improving any of these cardiopulmonary function measures.

### Skeletal Muscle Function Metrics

Measures included:

*   Single-leg stand test (time able to stand on one leg with eyes closed).
*   Handgrip strength.
*   Push-ups.
*   Sit-and-reach test (lower back and hamstring flexibility).

*   Of these four measures, only the **single-leg stand test was significantly changed by exercise**.
*   NMN showed an **additive effect on improving the single-leg stand test** (P < 0.05).
    *   Specifically, the medium-dose NMN group performed better compared to controls.
*   The authors proposed that NMN's additive effect on aerobic capacity metrics resulted from changes in muscle function, given the improvement in the single-leg stand test and the lack of change in cardiopulmonary metrics. This hypothesis warrants further investigation in future studies.
