# 2024-08-04 Lead Is Associated With An Older Biological Age And An Increased Mortality Risk

## Executive Summary

*   Elevated blood lead levels are significantly associated with an older biological age. A one standard deviation increase in blood lead is linked to approximately a five-year increase in biological age.
*   Higher blood lead levels are associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality in both women and men.
*   For women, higher blood lead levels are associated with a 48% increased risk of death from all causes.
*   For men, higher blood lead levels are associated with a 22% increased risk of death from all causes.
*   Optimal blood lead levels for reduced all-cause mortality risk appear to be less than 0.8 micrograms per deciliter.

## Scientific Findings

### Association with Biological Age

*   A one standard deviation increase in blood lead levels is associated with a biological age that is approximately five years older.
*   This association is comparable in magnitude to other known biomarkers of aging, such as glucose and HbA1c levels.

### Association with All-Cause Mortality Risk

#### Study 1 (Shorter Follow-up)

*   This study included approximately 26,000 participants with a median follow-up of seven years and an average age of 46 years.
*   **Lead (Pb):**
    *   Women: A 48% increased risk of death from all causes.
    *   Men: A 22% increased risk of death from all causes.
*   **Cadmium:**
    *   Women: A 28% higher risk of death from all causes.
    *   Men: A 39% higher risk of death from all causes.
*   **Mercury:**
    *   No statistically significant association was found with all-cause mortality risk in either women or men. The 95% confidence intervals overlapped with a hazard ratio of one.

#### Study 2 (Longer Follow-up)

*   This study included over 14,000 participants with an average age of 44 years and a median follow-up of nineteen years.
*   **Lead (Pb):**
    *   The lowest all-cause mortality risk was associated with blood lead levels of 0.8 micrograms per deciliter.
    *   For all blood lead levels higher than 0.8 micrograms per deciliter, a significantly increased risk of death from all causes was observed.
    *   **Optimal Target:** Blood lead levels less than 0.8 micrograms per deciliter appear to be optimal for reducing all-cause mortality risk.

### Quantification and Testing

*   Blood lead levels can be quantified through laboratory testing.
*   The author plans to have their blood lead levels tested as part of their 2024 testing schedule on September 3rd.
*   Testing is being conducted through a direct-to-consumer laboratory service, which bypasses the need for physician orders.
