### Executive Summary

*   Indoor carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are generally not a significant health threat due to constant air exchange with the outside, though they can be used to predict room occupancy.
*   While air purification effectively removes pathogens, it is insufficient for health; diverse microbial exposure from sources like pets, plants, and outdoor environments is crucial for immune system development and overall well-being.
*   Modern lifestyles, where individuals spend up to 90% of their time indoors with limited access to nature, necessitate strategies to either increase outdoor exposure or intentionally bring biological diversity into the home environment.
*   Maintaining indoor humidity at comfortable levels typically prevents excessive moisture accumulation that promotes harmful fungal growth on surfaces. Research is ongoing into building materials that incorporate antifungals or living structures to mitigate fungal colonization in wet conditions.

## Indoor Air Quality: Carbon Dioxide

Monitoring carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in indoor environments is a factor in managing sealed structures, but it is not a major threat to health. Even in sealed buildings, air exchange with the outside is processed, preventing significant increases in CO2 concentrations. For instance, in positive or negative pressure rooms in hospitals, CO2 concentrations show only a small increase even when rooms are packed with people. While these slight increases are not dangerous, they can be used to predict the number of people present in a room. Therefore, focusing on CO2 levels is not a primary concern for microbial growth or health risks.

## Air Purification and Microbial Exposure

The focus for optimizing the indoor environment should be on introducing beneficial elements rather than solely on eliminating perceived threats like oxygen and CO2 levels. Air purification plays a significant role in removing harmful bacteria, viruses, and fungi. However, an overly sterile environment can be detrimental, especially for infants, as it deprives them of essential microbial exposure needed for immune system development.

To create a balanced and beneficial indoor environment, air purification should be complemented with diverse microbial stimulation. This approach ensures the removal of pathogens while fostering a rich exposure that aids immune system development.

**Strategies for Optimizing Microbial Exposure in Indoor Environments:**

*   Utilize air filters to remove harmful pathogens.
*   Introduce pets (e.g., dogs), allowing for direct interaction that provides microbial exposure.
*   Place numerous plants throughout the room to enrich the indoor microbiome.
*   Encourage regular outdoor activities to gain broad antigenic stimulation.
*   Bring elements of nature, such as soil, into a child's experience.
*   Visit natural environments like forests.
*   Design and construct buildings to be more "biologically viable," integrating natural elements.

## Overcoming Modern Lifestyle Limitations

While outdoor exposure is highly beneficial for immune stimulation, most individuals, particularly Americans, spend up to 90% of their time indoors. This is exacerbated by car-driven societies where even suburban areas often lack sidewalks or accessible natural spaces. Urban environments present even greater challenges. To overcome these societal limitations, it is essential to provide people with access to natural spaces, either by building them or by intentionally integrating biological diversity into the home and built environment.

## Humidity and Fungal Mitigation

Maintaining appropriate humidity levels in the built environment is crucial. An indoor air society actively researches this topic, primarily focusing on maintaining humidity at levels that ensure human comfort. As long as the humidity is within a comfortable range, it is unlikely to be high enough to cause moisture to form on walls, which would promote fungal growth.

**Strategies for Mitigating Fungal Growth in Wet Conditions:**

*   Introduce antifungals into building materials.
*   Create a living structure within the building material itself that actively prevents the growth of fungi or limits the dominance of specific fungi, even when wet.

It is important to note that these advanced mitigation strategies, especially those involving living structures within building materials, are current topics of ongoing research and are not yet widely developed products.
