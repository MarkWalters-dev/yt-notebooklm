# 2023-11-21 Epigenetic Test 9 - Finally A Younger Horvath Age Than the Chronological

## Executive Summary

*   The latest Horvath epigenetic age (from a 2023-10-09 test) is 49.4 years, representing a 7-year reduction compared to the previous year's measurement of 56.3 years. This results in an epigenetic age younger than chronological age.
*   The average Horvath epigenetic age for 2023 thus far is 52.8 years, a 2.2-year reduction compared to the 2022 average of 55 years.
*   Higher copper intake (primarily from cacao beans) is significantly positively correlated with an older Horvath epigenetic age (p ≤ 0.05).
*   Higher Vitamin B12 intake is significantly inversely correlated with a younger Horvath epigenetic age (p ≤ 0.05).
*   Higher intake of salt (sodium), turmeric, and beets are all significantly inversely correlated with a younger Horvath epigenetic age (p ≤ 0.05 for each).

## Horvath Epigenetic Clock Overview

The Horvath test, also known as the DNA methylation age or epigenetic age, is considered a reliable epigenetic clock for predicting chronological age. It is a multi-cell and multi-tissue clock. The Horvath clock demonstrates a strong positive correlation with chronological age, with a correlation coefficient of 0.94 (where 1.0 would indicate a perfectly linear positive correlation).

## Personal Epigenetic Age Trends

*   **2022 Results:** Approximately one year prior to the latest test, the Horvath epigenetic age (intrinsic age) was 56.3 years, which was 7 years older than chronological age at that time. Across three tests in 2022, the average Horvath epigenetic age was 55 years, approximately 5 years older than chronological age.
*   **2023 Results (Single Test):** Blood test results from 2023-10-09 show a Horvath epigenetic age of 49.4 years. This represents a 7-year reduction in Horvath epigenetic age year-over-year.
*   **2023 Results (Average):** Across multiple tests thus far in 2023, the average Horvath epigenetic age is 52.8 years. This is a 2.2-year reduction compared to the 2022 average of 55 years. While the single 2023 test shows a 7-year reduction, the overall average reduction is 2.2 years. The objective is to further reduce this epigenetic age, aiming to replicate or surpass the 49.4-year measurement.

## Correlations with Macro and Micronutrients

To identify factors correlated with Horvath's epigenetic age, 42 macro and micronutrient variables were analyzed across nine tests.

*   **Significant Findings (p ≤ 0.05):**
    *   **Copper:** Showed a significant positive correlation. Higher copper intake was significantly correlated with an older Horvath epigenetic age. Primary sources of copper intake include cacao beans and mushrooms. Cacao beans showed a trend in the same direction (p=0.07), while mushrooms did not.
    *   **Vitamin B12:** Showed a significant inverse correlation. Higher Vitamin B12 intake was significantly correlated with a younger Horvath epigenetic age.
*   *Note:* Body weight, previously significant in an earlier analysis, is now just outside significance (p=0.06).

### Dietary Protocol Based on Nutrient Correlations (October 9 - November 17)

The goal is to adhere to observed correlations with the aim of reducing Horvath's epigenetic age, acknowledging that causation is not established.

*   **Copper & Cacao Beans (Positive Correlation with Age):**
    *   **Strategy:** Maintain intake at the lower end of the historical range.
    *   **Historical Intake Range (over 9 tests):**
        *   Copper: 3.9-5 mg/day
        *   Cacao beans: 2.4-9.8 g/day
    *   **Current Average Daily Intake (weighed and recorded via Cronometer):**
        *   Copper: 3.7 mg/day
        *   Cacao beans: 1.9 g/day
    *   **Adherence:** Current intake for both is below the low end of the historical range, effectively following the correlation.
*   **Vitamin B12 (Inverse Correlation with Age):**
    *   **Strategy:** Maintain current intake levels, as higher intake is correlated with a younger epigenetic age and was already implemented prior to the last test with the goal of reducing homocysteine.

## Correlations with Specific Foods

To identify foods correlated with Horvath's epigenetic age, 41 commonly consumed foods were analyzed across nine tests.

*   **Significant Findings (p ≤ 0.05):** Three foods showed a significant inverse correlation, meaning relatively higher intakes were significantly correlated with a younger Horvath epigenetic age.
    *   Salt (Sodium)
    *   Turmeric
    *   Beets

### Dietary Protocol Based on Food Correlations (October 9 - November 17)

The goal is to adhere to observed inverse correlations by maintaining intake at the higher end of the historical range, with the aim of reducing Horvath's epigenetic age.

*   **Salt (Sodium):**
    *   **Historical Intake Range (over 9 tests):** 1732-1770 mg/day
    *   **Current Average Daily Intake:** 1772 mg/day
    *   **Adherence:** Current intake is at the high end of the historical range.
*   **Turmeric:**
    *   **Historical Intake Range (over 9 tests):** 1.8-2.3 g/day
    *   **Current Average Daily Intake:** 2.5 g/day
    *   **Adherence:** Current intake is above the high end of the historical range.
*   **Beets:**
    *   **Historical Intake Range (over 9 tests):** 196-219 g/day
    *   **Current Average Daily Intake:** 219 g/day
    *   **Adherence:** Current intake is at the high end of the historical range.

## Future Plans

A retest (Test #7 in 2023) is scheduled for November 27. Results are expected in late December or early January, which will help assess the impact of these dietary adjustments.
