# 2021-08-09 Homocysteine Update: What's Optimal For Vitamin B12

## Executive Summary
*   Higher homocysteine levels are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk and generally increase with age.
*   Personal dietary tracking indicates that vitamin B6 and folate intake are not significantly correlated with homocysteine levels.
*   Vitamin B12 intake shows a significant inverse correlation with homocysteine levels in personal data, meaning higher B12 intake is associated with lower homocysteine.
*   One study suggests high blood levels of vitamin B12 may be associated with increased all-cause mortality risk, while another study indicates B12 supplementation is not associated with increased mortality and may even reduce cancer mortality risk.
*   Personal data does not show a significant correlation between vitamin B12 intake and biological age markers, suggesting that current B12 supplementation levels may be safe.

## Homocysteine Levels and Aging
Homocysteine levels tend to increase with age. Higher homocysteine levels are associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality.

## Personal Homocysteine Data
*   **2005-2009:** Average homocysteine value was 7.1 micromolar over six measurements. This was prior to implementing daily dietary tracking.
*   **2015-Present:** Average homocysteine value increased significantly to 10.2 micromolar, despite daily dietary tracking and weighing of food.
*   **Last Six Measurements:** Homocysteine levels have been maintained at 9.2 micromolar or less, indicating a trend towards the lower end of the personal range. The most recent measurement was 9.2 micromolar.

## Factors Impacting Homocysteine Metabolism

### Remethylation Pathway
This pathway, along with transmethylation and transsulfuration, is central to homocysteine metabolism.

### Betaine (Trimethylglycine)
*   An attempt to reduce homocysteine with 4 grams of betaine per day for a couple of years did not affect homocysteine levels.

### Vitamin B6
*   Adequate vitamin B6 is necessary for the conversion of homocysteine into cystathionine.
*   **Correlation with Personal Data (Prior to July 21st blood test):**
    *   Correlation coefficient (r) = 0.05
    *   P-value = 0.87
    *   This indicates a flat correlation, very close to zero, and not statistically significant.
*   **Correlation with Personal Data (After July 21st blood test):**
    *   Correlation coefficient (r) = 0.07
    *   The correlation remained flat and close to zero.
*   **Conclusion:** Vitamin B6 intake is not significantly correlated with homocysteine levels in personal data. Supplementation with B6 was stopped prior to the last blood test, and the correlation remained unchanged.

### Folate
*   Dietary folate is converted to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), which, in combination with vitamin B12, converts homocysteine to methionine, thereby reducing homocysteine levels.
*   **Correlation with Personal Data (Prior to last blood test):**
    *   Correlation coefficient (r) = -0.47
    *   P-value = 0.13
    *   This shows a negative correlation, suggesting higher folate intake is associated with lower homocysteine, but it is not statistically significant.
*   **Correlation with Personal Data (After last blood test):**
    *   Correlation coefficient (r) = -0.38
    *   The correlation moved closer to zero, indicating a weakening association.
    *   P-value = 0.2
*   **Conclusion:** Dietary folate intake does not appear to significantly impact homocysteine levels based on personal data.

### Vitamin B12
*   Vitamin B12 plays a crucial role in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine.
*   **Correlation with Personal Data (Prior to last blood test):**
    *   A strong, highly significant negative correlation was observed. Higher vitamin B12 intake was correlated with lower homocysteine levels.
*   **Correlation with Personal Data (After last blood test):**
    *   Correlation coefficient (r) = -0.77
    *   The strong negative correlation remained consistent.
    *   The previous homocysteine value was 9.2 micromolar.
    *   Dietary intake was reduced from 1000 mcg/day to 500 mcg/day.
*   **Conclusion:** Vitamin B12 intake is significantly correlated with homocysteine levels in personal data.

## Vitamin B12 Intake and All-Cause Mortality Risk
*   **Study 1: Blood Levels of Vitamin B12 vs. All-Cause Mortality Risk**
    *   Blood levels of vitamin B12 above approximately 400 pg/mL are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   Blood levels below 400 pg/mL are associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Conversion of Personal Dietary Data to Expected Blood Levels:**
    *   Based on an intake of 1000 mcg/day, expected blood levels were around 720 pmol/L (after conversion from picograms/mL). This would indicate a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   Reducing intake to 500 mcg/day would expect blood levels around 650 pmol/L, still potentially associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk, though lower.
*   **Challenge:** Achieving blood levels below 400 pg/mL may require very low B12 intake, which might be insufficient to optimally reduce homocysteine. A very small intake (e.g., ~5 mcg/day) might be sufficient to reach target blood levels for mortality risk reduction.

*   **Study 2: Vitamin B12 Supplementation vs. All-Cause Mortality Risk**
    *   This study found no increased all-cause mortality risk for any higher levels of B12 supplementation compared to no supplementation.
    *   Specific findings:
        *   100-999 mcg/day was associated with a significantly reduced risk for cancer-related mortality.
        *   Even low amounts (up to 5 mcg/day) showed a similar association for cancer mortality risk.
    *   **Conclusion:** High-dose B12 supplementation may be safe, potentially reducing cancer mortality risk.

## Reconciling Conflicting Vitamin B12 Data
The discrepancy between studies suggesting high blood levels are risky and supplementation appears safe may be explained by the duration and context of intake. Aging and disease are long-term processes.

## Vitamin B12 Intake and Biological Age
*   **Aging.ai Data (2016-2021, 23 blood tests):**
    *   Correlation between B12 intake and biological age = 0.25.
    *   P-value was not < 0.05, indicating no statistically significant correlation.
*   **Levine's Phenotypic Age Calculator Data (since 2018, 12 blood tests):**
    *   The correlation was nearly flat, indicating no significant correlation with B12 intake.
    *   Note: Data is not available for B12 intakes less than 500 mcg/day. More data may be needed for conclusive results.

## Future Considerations
*   Based on current biological age data, B12 intakes up to 1000 mcg/day may be safe.
*   An experiment to determine the minimal B12 dose that maximally reduces homocysteine without increasing biological age is planned. This may involve experimenting with lower doses or alternating higher doses (e.g., 1000 mcg every three days).
