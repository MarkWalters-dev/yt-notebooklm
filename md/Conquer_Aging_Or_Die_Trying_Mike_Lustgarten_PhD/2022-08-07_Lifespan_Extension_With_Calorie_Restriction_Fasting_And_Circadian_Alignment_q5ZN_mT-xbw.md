# 2022-08-07 Lifespan Extension With Calorie Restriction Fasting And Circadian Alignment

*Executive Summary*
*   Calorie Restriction (CR) combined with a short daily eating window (fasting) significantly increases mouse lifespan.
*   Circadian alignment (eating during an organism's active phase) further boosts the lifespan-extending effects of CR and fasting in mice.
*   A 12-hour eating window under CR and circadian alignment was found to be as effective as a 2-hour eating window for lifespan extension in mice.
*   CR without prolonged daily fasting offered only modest lifespan benefits, and in one study, decreased it.
*   For humans, preliminary speculation suggests an optimal eating window from morning to late afternoon/early evening may align with circadian rhythms.

## Impact of Calorie Restriction and Fasting on Mouse Lifespan

Earlier research has demonstrated that fasting drives the lifespan-extending effect of calorie restriction (CR).

*   **Study Design (Earlier Research):**
    Male C57 black 6j mice were divided into three groups to evaluate the effect of calorie restriction and fasting on survival:
    *   **Calorie Restricted (CR):** 30% calorie restriction, with all food consumed within a 2-hour eating window, followed by a 22-hour fast.
    *   **Ad Libitum (Ad Lib):** Mice ate as much as they wanted, whenever they wanted.
    *   **Diluted Ad Libitum:** 30% calorie restriction, achieved by diluting the Ad Lib diet, but *without* a restricted eating window or prolonged daily fasting. Total calorie intake matched the CR group.

*   **Results (Median Lifespan - 50% Survival):**
    *   The CR group (30% CR with a short eating window) showed a significant 20% increase in median lifespan compared to the Ad Lib diet group.
    *   In contrast, the diluted Ad Lib group (30% CR without prolonged fasting) experienced a significant 9% decrease in lifespan.

*   **Conclusion from Earlier Research:** These findings suggest that fasting, rather than just calorie reduction, plays a critical role in the lifespan-extending effect of calorie restriction. This also raised the question of whether lifespan could be further increased in fasted CR mice through circadian alignment.

## The Role of Circadian Alignment in Lifespan Extension

A more recent study investigated the combined effect of fasting and circadian alignment on lifespan in calorie-restricted mice. Circadian alignment for nocturnal mice means eating during the night (their active phase), not the day.

*   **Study Groups and Results:**
    *   **Ad Libitum (Ad Lib):** This control group, which was not calorie restricted, had a median lifespan of 792 days.
    *   **CR Spread:** 30% calorie restriction where food was spread throughout the day (given 9 times over 24 hours), meaning no prolonged fast longer than approximately 3 hours.
        *   Median lifespan increased by 10% compared to Ad Libitum.
        *   Maximum lifespan (10% survival) showed no significant difference compared to Ad Libitum.
    *   **CR Day:** 30% calorie restriction with a 12 or 22-hour fast, but eating occurred during the day. This represents circadian misalignment for nocturnal mice.
        *   Median lifespan reached approximately 950 days, a 20% increase compared to Ad Libitum.
        *   Maximum lifespan also increased compared to Ad Libitum.
    *   **CR Night:** 30% calorie restriction with a 12 or 22-hour fast, with eating restricted to the night. This represents circadian alignment for nocturnal mice.
        *   This group achieved the longest median lifespan, around 1050-1060 days, representing a remarkable 35% increase compared to Ad Libitum.
        *   Maximum lifespan was also significantly increased compared to the Ad Libitum diet.

## Optimal Eating Window Duration

The study also compared the effects of different fasting durations within the CR Day and CR Night groups (specifically, 2-hour versus 12-hour eating windows).

*   **Finding:** There was no additional increase in survival observed for mice with a 2-hour eating window compared to those with a 12-hour eating window, both within the CR Day and CR Night conditions. Median lifespans for these different window lengths were nearly identical or overlapping.
*   **Conclusion:** A 12-hour eating window, when combined with a calorie-restricted diet and circadian alignment, appears sufficient for optimizing lifespan in mice.

## Human Implications and Speculation

While there is currently no direct human lifespan data, speculation suggests that eating most food from sunup to sundown (morning to late afternoon/early evening) may be optimal for humans to align with their diurnal circadian rhythm. This aligns with the concept of circadian alignment, where food intake occurs during the organism's naturally active phase.
