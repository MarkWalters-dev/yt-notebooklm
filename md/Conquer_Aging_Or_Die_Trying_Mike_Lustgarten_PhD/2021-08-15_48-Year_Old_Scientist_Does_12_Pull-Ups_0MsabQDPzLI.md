# 2021-08-15 48-Year Old Scientist Does 12 Pull-Ups

## Executive Summary
* The subject, a 48-year-old scientist, aimed to maintain or improve upon a previous benchmark of 12 full-extension, full-flexion pull-ups completed approximately two years prior.
* The pull-up assessment is noted as one component of a larger, approximately 80-minute full-body workout routine.
* The goal of strength maintenance or improvement is set against the known physiological backdrop of age-related muscle strength decline.
* The scientist successfully achieved 12 pull-ups, tying the previous record.

## Strength Assessment Update
The subject performed a set of pull-ups, focusing on strict form criteria:
* Full flexion (complete stretch at the bottom).
* Full extension (chin above the bar at the top).
* Effort was made to minimize body swinging during the movement.

**Result:** The scientist successfully completed 12 pull-ups, matching the performance recorded approximately two years earlier.

## Context and Goal Setting
Muscle strength naturally declines during the aging process. The objective for this strength assessment was twofold:
1. **At worst:** Maintain the current level of strength performance.
2. **At best:** Improve upon the previous benchmark, if possible.

**Workout Context:**
The pull-up evaluation is integrated into a comprehensive fitness regimen:
* **Type:** 80-minute full-body workout.
* **Future Content:** The full video detailing the entire workout session is scheduled for release later in the month.
