# 2025-07-13 17y Younger Biological Age Test 4 in 2025 - Supplements Diet

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age was found to be 17 years younger than chronological age on Test 4 in 2025, consistent with Test 3.
*   Thyroid hormone replacement therapy was adjusted (reduced T4, increased T3) 12 days before testing.
*   Supplemental Vitamin D was discontinued due to increased sun exposure in Texas.
*   Nicotinic acid supplementation was removed prior to testing due to an inverse correlation with lymphocytes, which are associated with lower all-cause mortality risk at higher levels.
*   Homocysteine levels remained a significant weakness, despite supplementation with Methyl B12, Methylfolate, and B6.

## Prescription Medications

### Thyroid Hormone Adjustment
*   **Diagnosis:** Hypothyroidism in mid-twenties.
*   **Previous Regimen:** Levothyroxine (T4).
*   **Recent Change:** Reduced T4 and added T3.
*   **Specific Tweak (May 15, 12 days prior to Test 4):**
    *   Reduced T4 from 88 mcg to 75 mcg.
    *   Increased T3 (Cytomel) from 15 mcg to 20 mcg.
*   **Reasoning:** Despite efforts with diet and supplements, thyroid hormone production and conversion were suboptimal, necessitating ongoing supplemental therapy.

## Supplements

### Vitamin D
*   **Previous Protocol:** 2000 IU daily for nine months of the year (non-summer months).
*   **Current Status:** Discontinued.
*   **Reasoning:** Increased full-body sun exposure in Texas over the past 2.5 weeks has likely allowed for sufficient endogenous Vitamin D production.
*   **Future Monitoring (Test 6):** Will track 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to assess the impact of sunlight versus supplementation.

### Nicotinic Acid (Niacin)
*   **Previous Protocol:** Supplemental nicotinic acid used to maintain NAD levels.
*   **Current Status:** Zero intake for the 7-day period before testing.
*   **Reasoning for Removal:**
    1.  **NAD Level Association:** Higher NAD levels (>30 micromolar) were associated with worse mitochondrial function biomarkers, higher lysophosphatidylcholines, and increased diglycerides (linked to higher all-cause mortality risk).
    2.  **Lymphocyte Correlation:** A significant inverse correlation was observed between average daily niacin intake (including supplemental nicotinic acid) and lymphocyte count over 56 blood tests (2015-2025). Higher niacin intake correlated with lower lymphocytes.
    3.  **Optimal Lymphocyte Levels:** Published literature suggests that lymphocyte counts around 2,000 (1900-2100) are associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality. Declining lymphocyte levels, as observed with higher niacin intake, move in the wrong direction for mortality risk.
*   **NAD Measurement:** Blood sent to Ginfinity on May 27 for NAD analysis (finger prick). Results flagged as red (low) at 19 micromolar.
*   **Future Consideration:** Exploring nicotinamide (Vitamin B3 amide) as a potential alternative to increase NAD without negatively impacting other biomarkers like nicotinic acid did.

### B Vitamin Complex (Methyl B12, Methylfolate, B6)
*   **Supplement:** 1000 mcg Methyl B12, 400 mcg Methylfolate, and 1.5 mg B6 combined.
*   **Duration:** Taken for all 35 days leading up to Test 4.
*   **Objective:** Keep homocysteine levels low.
*   **Outcome:** Homocysteine increased from 9 to 10.7 micromolar despite supplementation (target is 5 micromolar). This remains a significant weakness.

### Riboflavin (Vitamin B2)
*   **Previous Intake:** Inconsistent and sporadic megadosing (one 400 mg pill on 14 out of 35 days in the prior period, and only one pill in the 7 days before testing).
*   **Current Approach:** Modified to achieve consistent, lower doses.
*   **New Method:**
    1.  Opened 400 mg riboflavin capsules.
    2.  Extracted approximately 100 mg (limit of food scale sensitivity).
    3.  Suspended in 900 ml of water (near solubility limit).
    4.  Consuming an aliquot daily to achieve approximately 6-10 mg per day.
*   **Rationale:** Wary of long-term risks associated with megadosing; aiming for a more physiological dose.
*   **Impact on Homocysteine:** Inconsistent intake may have contributed to suboptimal homocysteine levels. The new approach aims to improve this.

## Diet Composition (Average Daily Intake for 35-Day Period)

### General Food Intake
*   **Data Tracking:** Food weighed daily and entered into Cronometer.
*   **Green Tea:** 1 ounce daily (sourced from Japan).
*   **Reese's Peanut Butter Cups:** Average 44 calories per day (consumed as a cheat meal, not daily).
*   **Ice Cream:** Average 33 calories per day (consumed as a cheat meal, not daily).

### Experiments During the 35-Day Period

1.  **Strawberries:**
    *   **Increase:** +200 grams per day compared to Test 3.
    *   **Rationale:** Showed a positive net correlative score (+5) with 27 clinical chemistry biomarkers after Test 3. After Test 4, the score improved to +7.

2.  **Red Bell Pepper:**
    *   **Increase:** +40 grams per day.
    *   **Rationale:** Aimed to improve homocysteine levels due to an observed inverse correlation.
    *   **Outcome:** Homocysteine did not move in the desired direction. Correlation with homocysteine weakened after Test 4.

3.  **Alfalfa Sprouts:**
    *   **Removal:** Removed from diet.
    *   **Rationale:** Inversely correlated with lymphocytes. Contribution to lymphocyte levels is unclear as nicotinic acid was also removed. Will remain out for further observation.

4.  **Olives:**
    *   **Increase:** From ~5 grams per day to 36 grams per day (with some days reaching 50 grams).
    *   **Rationale:** Investigating if olives, rather than just olive oil, can positively impact biomarkers. High sodium content limits further increases.

5.  **Walnuts:**
    *   **Reduction:** From 55 grams per day (Test 3) to 3.5 grams per day.
    *   **Rationale:** Had a net correlative score of zero with 27 biomarkers, suggesting they did not significantly move needle. Calories reallocated to other foods like olives.

### Cheat Meals (Immediately Post-Blood Testing)
*   **Purpose:** To aid long-term dietary adherence and calorie control.
*   **Duration:** Typically 2-3 days after blood testing.
*   **Calorie Targets on Cheat Days:**
    *   Workout days: ~2300-2400 calories.
    *   Non-workout days: ~2100-2200 calories.
*   **Specifics for Test 4:**
    *   **Day 1:** ~1500 calories of Reese's Mini Peanut Butter Cups.
    *   **Day 2:** Large portion of Carvel ice cream cake (~1100 calories).
    *   **Day 3:** Homemade chocolate (ground cocoa beans, dates, and processed sugar) (~400 calories of sugar).
*   **Total Junk Calories:** ~3100 calories over 3 cheat days.
*   **Junk Calories as % of Total:** 3.8-4% of total calories for the 35-day period (compared to average American diet at 57% ultra-processed foods).

### Top 10 Foods by Calorie Intake
1.  Strawberries
2.  Oats (steel-cut)
3.  Chicken Breast
4.  Salmon
5.  Broccoli
6.  Sweet Potatoes
7.  Ground Beef
8.  Eggs
9.  Avocado
10. Cottage Cheese

*   **Note:** Nine of the top 10 foods were consistent with Test 3. Oats entered the top 10, while walnuts dropped out.

## Macronutrients

### Average Daily Calorie Intake
*   **Current Test (Test 4):** 2296 calories. This is the highest average daily intake since August 2022.
*   **Trend:** After a period of sequential calorie restriction (reducing intake by ~30 calories per test), calorie intake has begun to slowly increase since mid-2024.
*   **Rationale for Increase:** To avoid age-related body weight decline and potential loss of muscle/fat, and to mitigate cancer cachexia risk. Aiming for weight stability after midlife.

### Protein Intake
*   **Average Daily:** 96.5 grams.
*   **Percentage of Total Calories:** 17%.

### Fat Intake
*   **Average Daily:** 91 grams.
*   **Percentage of Total Calories:** 36%.
*   **Comparison to Test 3:** Reduced from 111 grams per day.
*   **Reasons for Reduction:**
    1.  **Glucose/HbA1c:** Higher total fat intake was correlated with higher glucose levels. Despite reducing fat, HbA1c remained stable at 5.4%.
    2.  **Cystatin C:** Investigating if lower fat intake improves Cystatin C levels (related to kidney function and GrimAge). Cystatin C did not improve with the fat reduction.
*   **Source of Fat Reduction:** Primarily from Omega-6 fatty acids, including the significant reduction in walnut intake.
    *   Omega-6: Reduced from 33g to 15g per day.

### Carbohydrate Intake
*   **Total Carbs:** 314 grams per day.
*   **Fiber:** 83 grams per day.
*   **Net Carbs:** 233 grams per day.
*   **Net Macronutrient Breakdown (after accounting for soluble fiber fermentation into SCFAs):**
    *   Total Fat: ~43%
    *   Net Carbs: ~41%
    *   Protein: ~17%
*   **Total Fructose:** 63 grams. This is lower than the approximate maximum intake observed historically (~double this amount).

## Micronutrients

*   **General Approach:** Full RDA coverage initially, followed by calculating correlations to identify micronutrients for higher intake to optimize biomarkers.
*   **Current Status:** Many micronutrient levels are higher than RDA, based on correlation data from 62 tests over 10 years.
*   *(Specific micronutrient values are presented in tables within the original transcript but are not detailed here for brevity. Users are encouraged to refer to the visual data if available.)*

## Experiments for Improving Weak Spots

*   **Homocysteine:** Remains a primary target. Continued exploration of B vitamin supplementation and dietary factors.
*   **DHEA Sulfate:** Also identified as a weak spot, but no specific experiments detailed for this test.
*   **Other Biomarkers:** Aiming to improve weak spots without negatively impacting already youthful biomarkers.
