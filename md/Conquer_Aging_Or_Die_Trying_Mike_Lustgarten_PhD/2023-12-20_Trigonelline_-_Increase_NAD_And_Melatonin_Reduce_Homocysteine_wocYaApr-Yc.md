# 2023-12-20 Trigonelline - Increase NAD And Melatonin Reduce Homocysteine

### Executive Summary

*   Aging is linked to NAD degradation, which increases homocysteine and depletes S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), leading to decreased melatonin.
*   NAD degradation, often via CD38, increases nicotinamide and nicotinic acid. Nicotinic acid combines with SAM to form Trigonelline and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), elevating homocysteine and reducing SAM for melatonin synthesis.
*   It is hypothesized that increasing Trigonelline intake can reverse these effects by shifting metabolic pathways to boost NAD and melatonin levels while reducing homocysteine.
*   The proposed mechanism involves Trigonelline converting back to nicotinic acid, which then leads to increased NAD synthesis, consumption of SAH (thereby lowering homocysteine), and increased production of SAM (boosting melatonin).
*   Rich dietary sources of Trigonelline include coffee (2200 µg/g), chickpeas (350 µg/g), and oats (112-230 µg/g).

## NAD Degradation and its Consequences

During aging, NAD degradation is linked to increased homocysteine and decreased methionine. This pathway outlines how:

**NAD Degradation Pathway:**

NAD (age-related increase in degradation, e.g., via CD38) -> Nicotinamide (increased)
Nicotinamide (increased, Le Chatelier's principle) -> Nicotinic Acid (increased)
Nicotinic Acid + S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) -> Trigonelline + S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)
SAH (increased, Le Chatelier's principle) -> Homocysteine (increased)

In parallel, the depletion of SAM during the conversion of nicotinic acid into Trigonelline has further implications:

SAM (lower levels) -> Melatonin (lower levels)
*(Under normal conditions: SAM + N-acetylserotonin -> Melatonin)*

This demonstrates how NAD degradation correlates with an increase in homocysteine (linked to vascular health and dementia risk) and a decrease in melatonin (affecting sleep quality and duration), both critical factors in aging.

## The Trigonelline Hypothesis: Increasing NAD and Melatonin, Reducing Homocysteine

The hypothesis suggests that specifically increasing Trigonelline could increase NAD and melatonin while reducing homocysteine. This is proposed through a reversal of the degradation pathway:

**Trigonelline Intervention Pathway:**

Trigonelline (increased, Le Chatelier's principle) -> Nicotinic Acid + (consumes SAH) + (produces SAM)

1.  **NAD Increase:**
    Nicotinic Acid (increased, Le Chatelier's principle) -> Nicotinamide (increased)
    Nicotinamide (increased, Le Chatelier's principle) -> NAD (increased)

2.  **Homocysteine Reduction:**
    SAH (consumed/lowered) -> Homocysteine (lowered)

3.  **Melatonin Increase:**
    SAM (increased) -> Melatonin (increased)

## Food Sources of Trigonelline

To test this hypothesis, identifying foods rich in Trigonelline is crucial.

*   **Coffee:** 2200 micrograms of Trigonelline per gram.
*   **Chickpeas:** 350 micrograms of Trigonelline per gram.
*   **Oats:** 112 to 230 micrograms of Trigonelline per gram.
*   **Barley:** 0.25 micrograms of Trigonelline per gram (very low).

## Experimental Protocol and Future Measurements

A personal experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary changes on Trigonelline levels and related biomarkers.

**Initial Trigonelline Measurements:**
Plasma Trigonelline levels were measured using a metabolomics kit, yielding values of 0.29, 0.15, 0.4, and 0.11 micromolar. The highest level (0.4 micromolar) coincided with a period of supplementing with 600 mg of nicotinic acid per day, suggesting a potential conversion of nicotinic acid to Trigonelline.

**Dietary Intervention:**

*   Chickpeas were reintroduced into the diet.
*   Consideration was given to reducing or eliminating oats and barley from the diet to make space for chickpeas, given their relatively lower Trigonelline content compared to chickpeas. Oats have approximately 400 times higher Trigonelline than barley.

**Future Blood Test (January 15, 2023):**

*   **Standard Panels:** Chem panel and CBC.
*   **Targeted Biomarkers:** NAD, homocysteine, and metabolomics (including Trigonelline).
*   **Melatonin Assessment:** Subjective measures of sleep quality and objective data on sleep duration using a fitness tracker will be used, as direct blood or saliva melatonin sampling in the middle of the night could disrupt sleep.
