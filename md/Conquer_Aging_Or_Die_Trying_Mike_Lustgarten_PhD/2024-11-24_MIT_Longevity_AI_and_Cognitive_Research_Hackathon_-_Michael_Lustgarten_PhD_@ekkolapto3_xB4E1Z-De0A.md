## Executive Summary
*   Aging is a biochemical process that leads to a near-linear increase in the risk of death after adolescence.
*   The central premise is that by tracking and optimizing biomarkers of organ and systemic function towards youthful levels, aging and disease risk can be slowed, potentially flattening mortality risk.
*   Young blood contains factors that can extend lifespan in older mice, suggesting biological age can be influenced by circulating factors.
*   In mice, higher lymphocyte levels and lower Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) are associated with increased longevity, independent of diet.
*   Both lymphocyte decline and RDW increase are observed in humans during aging and are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk, suggesting these mouse findings have translational relevance.

## The Mortality Risk Curve and the Premise of Longevity Research

*   Mortality risk increases nearly linearly with chronological age after approximately 10-14 years of age.
*   The goal is to flatten this mortality risk curve, maintaining low risk for as long as physically possible.
*   Aging and disease are decades-long biochemical processes, not sudden events.
*   **Central Premise:** By tracking and optimizing well-established biomarkers of organ and systemic function towards youthful levels, aging and disease risk can be slowed, potentially flattening mortality risk and optimizing health and lifespan.

## Hierarchy of Health Metrics

The approach prioritizes metrics in a hierarchical manner:

1.  **Physical and Cognitive Function:** This is the ultimate outcome, including body composition (muscle mass, visceral fat, bone density).
2.  **Under the Hood (Biomarkers):** These are quantifiable indicators of underlying physiological state.
    *   **Blood Biomarkers:** A key component of this category.
    *   **Further Subdivisions:** Cells, proteins, metabolites, epigenetics.

The aim is to define what "youthful data" looks like and to maintain biomarkers within that range, which is associated with reduced risk of death from all causes.

## Mouse Data and Longevity Evidence

### Heterochronic Parabiosis and Lifespan Extension

*   **Study:** Prolonged heterochronic parabiosis (connecting the bloodstream of an old and a young animal) decreased biological age and promoted longevity in old mice.
*   **Mechanism:** Old mice surgically connected to young mice for their lifespan exhibited a significant extension in median lifespan compared to control groups.
*   **Implication:** Young blood contains factors that can positively influence lifespan in older animals.

### Diet, Fasting, and Calorie Restriction in Mice

*   **Study:** Investigated the effects of fasting and calorie restriction (CR) on lifespan in female mice.
    *   Groups included: Ad libitum (free feeding), 1-day fasting, 2-day fasting, 20% CR, 40% CR.
    *   Total mice: 960 (192 per group).
*   **Lifespan Results:**
    *   Both fasting groups showed an increase in median survival.
    *   20% CR showed improvement over fasting.
    *   40% CR demonstrated the most significant extension in median survival (median lifespan of 36 months).
*   **Key Observation:** A notable number of mice, even in the ad libitum group, lived past 36 months, indicating individual variability in longevity.

### Biomarkers Associated with Longevity in Mice

Researchers analyzed biomarkers independently of diet groups to identify factors associated with longer lifespan:

*   **Lymphocytes (White Blood Cells):**
    *   **Finding:** Relatively higher levels of lymphocytes at 16 weeks of age were significantly correlated with longer longevity, regardless of diet group (ad libitum or CR).
    *   **Role:** Lymphocytes are a component of the immune system.

*   **Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW):**
    *   **Finding:** A higher RDW was significantly correlated with a shorter lifespan, independent of diet group.
    *   **Explanation:** RDW measures the variability in the size of red blood cells. Younger red blood cells are smaller; as they age, variability increases. A higher RDW indicates a mix of small and large red blood cells, often associated with aging.

## Human Evidence and Biomarker Trends

The observed patterns in mice are also present in humans:

### Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) in Humans

*   **Age-Related Trend:** RDW increases with chronological age in humans.
*   **Mortality Association:** Higher RDW levels in humans are associated with an increased risk of death from all causes.

### Lymphocyte Decline in Humans

*   **Age-Related Trend:** Lymphocyte counts decline with chronological age in humans.
*   **Mortality Association:** Age-related decline in lymphocytes is associated with an increased risk of death from all causes.

## Personal Data-Driven Approach: Michael Lustgarten's Biomarker Tracking

Michael Lustgarten tracks a comprehensive panel of biomarkers (25-30 from standard chemistry panel and CBC) from approximately 5-8 blood tests per year for the past 10 years (51 tests total).

### Personal RDW Trend

*   **Observation:** His RDW shows a significant inverse correlation with his chronological age.
*   **Interpretation:** This indicates he has resisted or potentially reversed the typical age-related increase in RDW, maintaining it at youthful levels.

### Personal Lymphocyte Trend

*   **Observation:** His lymphocyte count shows an age-related decline, similar to the general population trend.
*   **Interpretation:** This highlights that not all biomarkers are easily optimized and that interventions are needed to counteract age-related changes.

## Investigating Interventions: Diet and Calorie Intake

### Data Collection and Analysis

*   **Methodology:** All food intake has been weighed and logged in a diet tracking app (Cronometer) since 2015. This data, including macros, micros, and individual foods, is exported to a spreadsheet.
*   **Correlation Analysis:** Average dietary intake over periods between blood tests is correlated with corresponding biomarker values. This allows for the identification of potential dietary influences on specific biomarkers.

### Calorie Intake and Lymphocytes

*   **Correlation:** In his data, average daily calorie intake showed a significant correlation with lymphocyte levels.
*   **Extrapolation:** Based on this correlation, increasing calorie intake to approximately 2,800 kcal per day might be beneficial for lymphocytes.
*   **Counteracting Factors:** However, higher calorie intake is also correlated with negative trends in nearly half of the 25-30 tracked biomarkers, including:
    *   **RDW:** Higher calories correlated with higher RDW.
    *   **LDL Cholesterol:** Higher calories correlated with higher LDL.

### The Challenge of Optimizing Multiple Biomarkers

*   **Trade-offs:** Interventions that improve one biomarker may negatively impact others. For example, increasing calories might improve lymphocytes but worsen RDW and LDL.
*   **Goal:** The aim is to optimize all biomarkers holistically, seeking the "bottom of the U-shaped curve" where overall risk is minimized.

### Current Strategy and Lymphocyte Levels

*   **Current Intake:** Michael is currently consuming around 2,100 kcal per day, intentionally lower than the extrapolated optimum for lymphocytes, prioritizing benefits for other biomarkers through calorie restriction.
*   **Recent Data:** Despite this, recent lymphocyte counts have hovered around 1,900, suggesting that the current approach may be slowing the age-related decline and moving towards youthful values.

## Addressing Data Analysis and Experimental Design

### Correlation vs. Regression

*   **Approach:** Primarily uses unadjusted correlations and direct testing of hypotheses by observing changes after interventions.
*   **Rationale:** Avoids discarding potentially valuable data due to statistical exclusion. The focus is on observing gross patterns and testing them iteratively.
*   **Future:** Plans to incorporate multiple regression and more sophisticated statistical modeling with the development of a personalized data analysis app.

### Confounding Factors

*   **Acknowledgement:** Recognizes that factors like body weight and overall calorie intake can confound simple correlations.
*   **Method:** Adjusts models to account for these potential confounders when necessary to dig deeper into specific associations.

### Outlier Data

*   **Approach:** Does not discard outlier data, viewing them as potential leads for novel hypotheses or unexpected mechanisms.
*   **Example:** A high dose of nicotinic acid, while increasing NAD, resulted in a significant outlier for a specific epigenetic biomarker (DNA damage marker - "Donita Pace"), providing insight for further investigation.

### Sex-Specific Differences in Longevity Research

*   **General Trends:** Some trends, like RDW increase with age, appear sex-independent.
*   **Specific Examples:** Immune cell dynamics can be biphasic in women during aging, unlike the more linear trend in men.
*   **Standardization:** For women, standardizing measurement timing relative to the menstrual cycle is crucial for consistent data collection.

## Practical Considerations

### Measuring Food Intake

*   **Method:** Weighs all food using a food scale and logs it into a diet tracking app.
*   **Eating Out:** Generally avoids eating out. If it occurs infrequently, calories are ballparked. The impact of such infrequent events on long-term data averages is considered minimal.

### Tracking Red Blood Cell Size (MCV)

*   **Measurement:** Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), which represents the average size of red blood cells, is tracked as part of the panel.
*   **Current Trend:** MCV has been trending upward, indicating a move in the "wrong direction" (larger red blood cells), which is being addressed through interventions based on correlations.
