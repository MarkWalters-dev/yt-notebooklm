# 2022-03-06 Centenarian Blood Test Analysis n=1 754 Part II

## Executive Summary

*   Centenarian total cholesterol levels (median 182 mg/dL) are not definitively indicative of either aged or youthful states, but may be "bad" for women concerning all-cause mortality risk.
*   Centenarian LDL levels (median 108 mg/dL) are suboptimal and trending in the "wrong direction" for longevity, leaning towards "bad".
*   Centenarian red blood cell counts (median 4.2 x 10^12/L) suggest a cellular age 30-80 years younger than their chronological age, indicating "good" levels.
*   Centenarian hemoglobin (median 9.29 g/dL) and MCV (median 120 fL) levels are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk, indicating "bad" or aged and unhealthy levels.
*   Centenarian AST levels (median 21.3 U/L) are associated with lowest all-cause mortality risk ("good"), while ALT levels (median 10.6 U/L) are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk ("bad"). The AST/ALT ratio (median 2) is "bad" due to increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   Centenarian homocysteine (HCY) levels (median 23.1 µmol/L) are significantly elevated compared to younger populations and associated with a substantially increased all-cause mortality risk, indicating "bad" and unhealthy levels.

## Blood Test Biomarkers in Centenarians

### Total Cholesterol

*   **Centenarian Median:** 4.7 mmol/L (182 mg/dL)
*   **Aging Trend:** Total cholesterol increases from youth and then decreases with advanced age. Extrapolation suggests centenarians would be expected in the 170-180 mg/dL range.
*   **All-Cause Mortality (ACM) Risk (75-99 year olds):**
    *   Lowest ACM risk observed in the 220-229 mg/dL range.
    *   Centenarian median of 182 mg/dL:
        *   Men: Not significantly increased ACM risk.
        *   Women: 5% significantly increased ACM risk.
    *   ACM risk significantly increased when total cholesterol was < 170 mg/dL for both sexes.
*   **Conclusion:** Centenarian total cholesterol may be neutral for men but "bad" for women in terms of ACM risk. Age-related trends alone cannot definitively label 182 mg/dL as "aged" or "youthful" as it can be found in both age groups.

### LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein)

*   **Centenarian Median:** Not explicitly stated for centenarians, but high non-centenarian median was 2.8 mmol/L (108 mg/dL).
*   **Aging Trend:** LDL increases from youth and then decreases with advanced age. Extrapolation suggests centenarians would be expected in the 100-110 mg/dL range.
*   **All-Cause Mortality (ACM) Risk:**
    *   Lowest risk observed in the 120-180 mg/dL range.
    *   Centenarian value of 108 mg/dL is slightly above the optimal range and trending in the "wrong direction" as LDL is expected to further decrease with greater longevity.
*   **Conclusion:** Centenarians have suboptimal LDL levels, leaning towards "bad". This association may be confounded by malnutrition (low albumin and lymphocytes), which can be linked to low LDL (< 100 mg/dL) and increased mortality risk.

### Red Blood Cells (RBCs)

*   **Centenarian Median:** 4.2 x 10^12/L
*   **Aging Trend:** RBCs decline with age. Values for 95-100 year olds are around 3.9 x 10^12/L.
*   **Contextualization:** Centenarian RBC levels of 4.2 x 10^12/L align with expected values for:
    *   Men: Around 70 years old, and potentially around 20 years old.
    *   Women: Around 50-60 years old.
*   **Conclusion:** Centenarian RBC levels are indicative of a youthful state, 30-80 years younger than their chronological age, which is "good".

### Hemoglobin

*   **Centenarian Median:** 92.9 g/L (9.29 g/dL)
*   **All-Cause Mortality (ACM) Risk:**
    *   Men: Hemoglobin < 13 g/dL associated with ~50% increased ACM risk.
    *   Women: Hemoglobin < 11 g/dL associated with increased ACM risk.
*   **Conclusion:** Centenarian hemoglobin levels are "bad," potentially indicating unhealthy levels.

### Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)

*   **Centenarian Median:** 120 femtoliters (fL)
*   **Aging Trend:** MCV increases with age. Youthful values are around 86-87 fL.
*   **All-Cause Mortality (ACM) Risk:**
    *   Reference (Q2): Men 90.5-93 fL, Women 89.2-91.6 fL.
    *   Increased ACM risk observed in the fourth quartile (MCV > 95.8 fL for men, > 94.2 fL for women).
*   **Conclusion:** Centenarian MCV of 120 fL falls into the fourth quartile, indicating "bad," aged, and unhealthy levels.

### Liver Enzymes: AST and ALT

#### AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)

*   **Centenarian Median:** 21.3 U/L
*   **All-Cause Mortality (ACM) Risk:**
    *   Centenarian AST falls into Q2 (median ~21 U/L).
    *   Relatively lower AST (< 20 U/L) was associated with the lowest ACM risk.
*   **Conclusion:** Centenarian AST levels are associated with the lowest ACM risk, indicating "good".

#### ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)

*   **Centenarian Median:** 10.6 U/L
*   **All-Cause Mortality (ACM) Risk:**
    *   Centenarian ALT falls into Q1 (median ~15 U/L).
    *   Relatively higher ALT (18-22 U/L) was associated with the lowest ACM risk.
*   **Conclusion:** Centenarian ALT levels are associated with increased ACM risk, indicating "bad".

#### AST/ALT Ratio

*   **Centenarian Median:** 2
*   **All-Cause Mortality (ACM) Risk:**
    *   Higher AST/ALT ratios were significantly associated with increased ACM risk.
    *   Low AST/ALT ratio average: 1.02
    *   High AST/ALT ratio average: 1.83
*   **Conclusion:** The centenarian AST/ALT ratio of 2 is "bad," indicating a significantly increased ACM risk.

### Homocysteine (HCY)

*   **Centenarian Median:** 23.1 µmol/L
*   **Aging Trend:** Homocysteine levels increase with age. Values in individuals aged 65-80 can reach up to 19 µmol/L.
*   **All-Cause Mortality (ACM) Risk:**
    *   Lowest ACM risk observed at the lowest possible homocysteine levels.
    *   Risk increases significantly with higher homocysteine.
    *   At 5 µmol/L, centenarian levels (23.1 µmol/L) represent at least a 2.5-fold higher ACM risk.
*   **Conclusion:** Centenarian homocysteine levels are "bad," significantly elevated and associated with aged, unhealthy levels and a substantially increased ACM risk.

*   **Bad:** Hemoglobin, MCV, ALT, AST/ALT Ratio, Homocysteine
*   **Ambiguous/Mixed:** Total Cholesterol (neutral for men, bad for women), LDL (suboptimal, trending wrong direction)
