# 2024-09-29 Siim Land's Health Fitness And Longevity Approach

**Executive Summary:**

*   **Dietary Flexibility & Body Composition:** Siim Land emphasizes that metabolic flexibility and maintaining an optimal body fat percentage year-round are paramount. While he has experimented with various macro ratios (from high-carb to low-carb), he finds that consistent exercise and calorie intake (without overeating) allow for thriving on diverse whole-food diets, with blood markers largely unaffected by macro shifts as long as body composition is optimal.
*   **Optimized Protein Intake:** For lean and active individuals, protein intake around 0.7-0.8 grams per pound of body weight (1.6 grams per kilogram) is sufficient for maximal muscle growth and strength. Higher intakes (e.g., 1 gram per pound) are considered overkill for this demographic, with potential risks such as increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and adverse effects on gut health through fermentation of undigested protein, particularly from animal sources.
*   **Balanced Exercise Regimen:** His current approach combines resistance training (3 times/week, push/pull/legs split focusing on compound lifts for strength, 4-6 reps, 3 sets) and cardiovascular exercise (2-3 times/week Zone 2 cardio for 55 minutes, plus occasional HIIT of 4x 2-4 minute intervals at 80-90% max heart rate). This even split is supported by research for long-term health benefits, prioritizing single-focus workouts for optimal results.
*   **Comprehensive Sleep Hygiene:** Sleep optimization involves minimizing evening artificial light (using red light bulbs, dimming lights, blue-blocking glasses), maintaining consistent bedtime, stopping food intake at least 5 hours before bed, using blackout curtains/sleep masks, and maintaining a cool room temperature (aided by a cooling mattress).
*   **Targeted Supplementation:** Key supplements are chosen based on specific biomarker optimization and known longevity pathways: Glycine (10-15g/day for glutathione, collagen, methionine balance, and sleep), Collagen peptides (for skin elasticity), Trimethylglycine (TMG) (to lower homocysteine), Creatine (for muscle, brain health, sleep restriction counteraction), Magnesium (for common deficiency), Omega-3s (1.5g EPA/DHA for index optimization), and microdose Melatonin (for sleep and anti-aging effects).

## Diet & Nutrition Philosophy

Siim Land's dietary approach has evolved from high-carb to ketogenic/low-carb (around 100g carbs/day) and back to a moderate-to-higher carbohydrate intake (200-300g carbs/day).

**Key Principles:**

*   **Metabolic Flexibility:** He emphasizes that maintaining an optimal body fat percentage and exercising regularly allows one to thrive metabolically on a variety of diets. Blood markers (glucose, insulin sensitivity) remained similar across low-carb and higher-carb phases due to consistent activity and lean body composition.
*   **Intuitive Eating with Awareness:** Does not count calories or macros daily. Instead, he eats to satiety, prioritizing protein. Periodically (every few months), he tracks intake for a few days to recalibrate and understand approximate macro and calorie amounts.
*   **Body Composition as a Guide:** Adjusts calorie intake based on body fat levels – reducing if gaining too much fat, increasing if getting too lean or feeling weak/tired.
*   **Whole Foods Focus:** Higher carbohydrate intake comes from whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, berries, tubers, and some whole grains. Processed foods, donuts, or ice cream are not the basis of his "high carb" approach.
*   **Satiety:** Finds he is almost always satiated after meals, rarely experiencing intense cravings. This is attributed to his diet structure and consistent exercise.
*   **"Cheat" Meals:** Incorporates occasional treats (e.g., low-calorie or regular ice cream, 1-2 times/week) in small doses. He views the dose as critical; small amounts are unlikely to negatively impact health or longevity, especially when balanced with regular exercise and a nutrient-dense diet.
    *   He estimates that 5-10% of calories can come from less optimal foods without significant detriment, depending on individual fitness, age, and metabolic health.

**Daily Eating Pattern:**

*   **First Meal (10 AM):** Protein shake/smoothie blended with frozen berries and a handful of walnuts (5-6 nuts, sometimes Brazil nuts or almonds). Provides 30-35g protein.
*   **Pre-Workout:** Waits 2-3 hours after the first meal, then trains.
*   **Post-Workout:** Cools down, uses sauna, then has dinner.
*   **Second Meal (Dinner, 4 PM):**
    *   **Carbohydrates:** Sweet potatoes, buckwheat, occasionally rice.
    *   **Vegetables:** Broccoli, cauliflower, peas, carrots (usually steamed).
    *   **Protein:** Fish, meat (few times/week), 2-3 eggs. Aims for ~90g protein from this meal.
    *   **Optional:** Black beans or kidney beans.
*   **Third Meal (Immediately after dinner, ~5 PM):** Cottage cheese or Greek yogurt with berries or nuts.
*   **Fasting Window:** No more eating until the first meal the next day (fasts for ~17 hours from 5 PM to 10 AM).
*   **Morning Routine (6-7 AM wake-up):** Works immediately after waking, drinks tea (green tea, chamomile, spicy Indian teas) or coffee and mineral water. Not hungry during this time.

**Protein Intake Adjustments:**

*   Reduced average protein intake from 150g+ to 130-140g/day.
*   **Rationale:** Research suggests maximal muscle growth benefits peak around 0.7-0.8 grams per pound of body weight. Personal DXA scans showed muscle gain even with reduced protein, while simultaneously losing body fat.
*   **Considerations for Higher Protein:** Overweight individuals may benefit from higher protein (e.g., 1 gram per pound) due to its satiety effect and higher thermic effect of food (burning more calories during digestion).
*   **Risk of Excess Protein:** Beyond optimal levels, excess protein can lead to elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), potentially impacting kidney function (especially with age-related decline) and gut health (if undigested protein reaches the colon and is fermented by gut bacteria, producing deleterious metabolites).
*   **Plant vs. Animal Protein:** Higher intakes of plant-based proteins appear safer regarding protein fermentation effects compared to animal-based proteins. Animal proteins have higher biological value for muscle protein synthesis, so less is needed. Plant-based protein sources may require 20-30% higher intake to achieve similar muscle protein synthesis effects.

## Exercise Regimen

Siim's current workout plan has drastically changed in the last 2-3 years, shifting from primarily strength training to an even split of cardio and resistance training for long-term health benefits.

**Overall Schedule (5-6 days/week training, 1 rest day):**
*   Alternates between strength and cardio days.
*   One day per week is typically a full rest day or light walking.

**Strength Training Protocol (3 times/week):**

*   **Split:** Push/Pull/Legs.
*   **Focus:** Compound lifts for strength and bone density (not just muscle mass).
*   **Workout Structure:** Two main compound lifts per session.
    *   **Push Day (e.g., Monday):** Horizontal push (Bench press or Incline press) and Vertical push (Overhead press or Seated dumbbell shoulder press).
    *   **Leg Day (e.g., Wednesday):** Squats (high bar for deeper range, low bar for heavier weight slightly below 90 degrees) and Stiff-leg deadlifts.
    *   **Pull Day (e.g., Saturday):** Horizontal pull (Barbell rows) and Vertical pull (Pull-ups or similar).
*   **Sets & Reps:**
    *   Warm-up sets (5 minutes, gradually increasing weight) followed by 3 working sets of 4-6 repetitions.
*   **Rest:** 3-4 minutes between working sets to maximize mechanical tension (primary driver of muscle hypertrophy and strength). Avoids circuit training for strength sessions to maintain single-focus.
*   **Duration:** 30-45 minutes per session.

**Cardiovascular Training Protocol:**

*   **Zone 2 Cardio (2-3 times/week):**
    *   **Duration:** 55 minutes on average.
    *   **Intensity:** Low intensity, easy jog (able to breathe through the nose, could continue for 2-3 hours). Heart rate typically in the low 100s (120-130 bpm).
    *   **Goal:** Build cardiovascular base.
*   **HIIT Workout (1 time/week or bi-weekly):**
    *   **Replacement:** May replace one Zone 2 session if included.
    *   **Structure:** 4 intervals.
    *   **Interval Duration:** 2-4 minutes "on" (at 80-90% of max heart rate), followed by 2-4 minutes "off" (slow jog, 50-60% max heart rate).
    *   **Tracking:** Uses a Polar heart rate monitor to ensure intensity targets are met.
    *   **Benefits:** Highly effective for VO2 max improvement and visceral fat reduction (personally reduced visceral fat from 350g to 50g with HIIT).

**Flexibility & Mobility:**

*   **Full Range of Motion:** Aims for full range of motion in most strength exercises (e.g., chest to bar bench press, hips below knees in squats).
*   **Daily Mobility:** Incorporates simple, consistent mobility practices:
    *   Deep squat position (while using phone or with dog).
    *   Knees-over-toes lunges (full range of motion).
    *   Couch stretch (for hip flexors, especially after sitting).
    *   Toe touches (stretching hamstrings).
    *   Hanging (from a bar for 1-2 minutes daily, to decompress spine and loosen shoulder joints).
*   **Rationale:** Acknowledges flexibility/mobility as underrated for older age joint health, youthful gait, and phenotype.

## Sleep Optimization

Siim follows a consistent sleep routine to optimize recovery and hormone balance.

**Sleep Routine:**

*   **Consistent Bedtime:** Aims to go to bed around the same time each night (between 9:30 PM and 10:30 PM).
*   **Light Management:**
    *   Minimizes bright artificial light in the evening (uses dim, red-spectrum lights like Himalayan salt lamps or red light bulbs).
    *   Wears blue-blocking glasses when using smartphones/screens before bed.
    *   Uses blackout curtains and a sleep mask (especially in summer months when sunrise is early).
*   **Meal Timing:** Stops eating 5 hours before bedtime. Finds that eating too close to bed reduces deep sleep and delays sleep onset. Going to bed slightly hungry often results in better deep sleep.
*   **Room Temperature:** Uses an Eight Sleep cooling mattress, particularly beneficial in warmer months, as being too hot can disrupt sleep.
*   **Air Quality:** Ventilates the room before bed and in the morning; occasionally uses an air filtration device.
*   **Sleep Duration Goal:** Aims for 7-8 hours of sleep per night, ideally 7.5 to 8 hours, for optimal feeling and performance.

**Melatonin Context:**
*   Minimizing bright light aims to prevent suppression of endogenous melatonin, which he considers a primary anti-aging hormone, not just for sleep but also as an antioxidant and regulator of systems like glutathione and autophagy.

## Supplement Protocol

Siim takes a targeted selection of 6-7 supplements based on research and personal biomarker data.

**Current Supplements:**

1.  **Glycine (10-15g/day):** Taken with evening tea (3g) and added to protein shakes/cottage cheese.
    *   **Rationale:** Supports glutathione synthesis, collagen synthesis, methionine-glycine balance (counteracting potential negative effects of excess methionine from muscle meats/eggs, which are linked to shorter lifespans in animal studies and higher visceral fat in humans), supports creatine synthesis, good for sleep, and lowers blood sugar. Believes most people don't get enough from a typical diet.
2.  **Collagen Peptides (for skin elasticity):** Taken separately from glycine, recognizing that 10g of collagen yields only 3g of glycine.
3.  **Trimethylglycine (TMG) (2-4g/day):**
    *   **Rationale:** To lower homocysteine levels, which were slightly elevated (at 12) and are a personal "weak spot." Initiated at 2g, then increased to 4g to achieve optimal levels (aiming for closer to 5).
    *   **Note:** Monitors for potential trade-offs, as clinical trials suggest TMG over 2g can increase cholesterol.
4.  **Creatine:** Taken ~80% of the time (not daily).
    *   **Rationale:** For muscle strength, power, brain health, and counteracting negative effects of sleep restriction (reducing sleep demand). It's one of the most researched supplements for sports performance.
5.  **Magnesium (up to 400mg/day):**
    *   **Rationale:** As an "insurance policy" against common magnesium deficiency.
6.  **Omega-3s (1.5g EPA + DHA combined):**
    *   **Rationale:** To increase omega-3 index. Personal index was 9% (above optimal 8%), but continues supplementation for optimal range and general health benefits.
7.  **Melatonin (0.3mg microdose):** Taken a few times a week, not daily.
    *   **Rationale:** To support sleep and leverage its anti-aging properties.

## Biomarker Insights & Weak Spots

Siim consistently tracks various biomarkers to guide his health strategy.

**Tracked Biomarkers:**

*   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV) & Resting Heart Rate (RHR):** Consistently tracked for 4-5 years.
    *   **Personal Data:** RHR consistently low (38-40 bpm, improved slightly from low 40s). HRV consistently high (over 100).
    *   **Management:** Minor dips in HRV or increases in RHR (e.g., RHR to 44, HRV to 89) prompt a check for sleep, stress, illness, or minor breaks from exercise, leading to normalization.
    *   **Long-Term View:** Expects some age-related changes but aims to resist them through consistency. Would investigate root causes beyond exercise dose if sustained adverse trends appear.
*   **Homocysteine:**
    *   **Weak Spot:** Has consistently been slightly elevated (11-13) in the past.
    *   **Intervention:** Supplementing with TMG (Trimethylglycine) to lower it, aiming for closer to 5.
    *   **Process Visualization (Potential Homocysteine Metabolism Pathway):**
        Dietary Protein -> Methionine -> Homocysteine -> (Methylation Cycle via B vitamins & TMG) -> Recycling back to Methionine OR (Transsulfuration Pathway via B6) -> Cysteine.
        Elevated Homocysteine (due to genetic predisposition or insufficient methyl donors) -> Increased systemic risk.
*   **Cholesterol (LDL, Lp(a), APOB, VLDL):**
    *   **Personal Data:** LDL is 77, Lp(a) is low (2.4), APOB is low (60s-70s), VLDL is low.
    *   **Interpretation:** Considers his cholesterol markers to be excellent and rejects arguments that LDL is "too low," citing studies that link low cholesterol to higher mortality often fail to account for confounding factors like malnutrition, cancer, or frailty in older populations. In younger, healthy individuals, lower LDL is generally associated with better outcomes.

**Protein Metabolism & Gut Health:**

*   **Excess Protein Risk:** High protein intake can lead to increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and, if undigested protein reaches the colon, fermentation by gut bacteria.
*   **Deleterious Metabolites:** This fermentation produces metabolites that can impact kidney function, heart, vasculature, and brain health.
*   **Gut-Kidney Axis (Potential Degradation Pathway):**
    High Protein Intake -> (Potential) Insufficient Gastric Output (stomach acid, pepsin, declining with age) -> More Undigested Protein Reaches Colon -> Gut Bacteria Fermentation -> Production of Deleterious Metabolites (e.g., p-cresyl sulfate, indoxyl sulfate) -> Increased Systemic Inflammation -> Potential Degradation of Intestinal Tight Junctions (leaky gut) -> Further Activation of Inflammation & Impact on Organ Function.
*   **Age-Related Factors:** Declining kidney function and potentially more alkaline gut pH during aging may exacerbate these issues.

## Personal Interests & Philosophy

Siim Land's interest in longevity stems from a broader anthropological perspective on human evolution and advancing the human species.

*   **Longevity as Evolution:** He views extending human lifespan as the "next step" in human evolution and a highly challenging problem to solve, contrasting it with the relatively "easy" mechanisms of weight loss.
*   **Hobbies:** Beyond health research and exercise, he enjoys history, philosophy, understanding human species, and following politics and culture.
*   **Entertainment:** Favorite movies include *Lord of the Rings*, *Star Wars*, *Dune*. Enjoys heavy music, specifically death metal/deathcore (e.g., Lorna Shore, Whitechapel, Signs of the Swarm), which he listens to while working out, writing, or napping.
*   **Future Vision:** Plans to evolve beyond solely content creation into business ventures within the longevity and life extension area, aiming to provide services that meaningfully support people's longevity in the future.
*   **Motivation for Exercise:** Would continue exercising even if a pill offered all its health benefits, finding enjoyment in movement (bouldering, gymnastics, hiking, cycling) and his consistent routine.
