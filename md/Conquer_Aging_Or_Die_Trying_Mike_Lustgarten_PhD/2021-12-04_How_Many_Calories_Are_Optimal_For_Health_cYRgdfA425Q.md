# 2021-12-04 How Many Calories Are Optimal For Health

## Executive Summary

*   Average daily calorie intake is not significantly correlated with biological age scores (PhenoAge, aging.ai).
*   Higher calorie intake is significantly correlated with increased VLDL, RDW, platelets, and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN).
*   Lower VLDL levels (<20 mg/dL) are associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular outcomes.
*   Lower RDW values (<13.1%) are associated with significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk.
*   Optimal platelet levels for reduced all-cause mortality are between 200-300 x 10^9/L, with higher values within this range potentially being better based on aging data.
*   Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) shows a U-shaped curve for all-cause mortality risk, with the lowest risk around 16 mg/dL, suggesting lower is generally better when considering aging trends.
*   A net negative correlation between calorie intake and these biomarkers suggests aiming for a calorie intake below the individual's average.

## Methodology

The study methodology involved tracking personal dietary intake and correlating it with blood test biomarkers.

*   **Food Tracking:**
    *   Weighing all food daily using a food scale since April 2015.
    *   Entering food amounts into a tracking app (e.g., Cronometer, MyFitnessPal).
    *   Exporting data including macronutrients, micronutrients, and individual food amounts into a spreadsheet.
*   **Biomarker Data:**
    *   Collecting up to 33 blood tests from April 2015 to November 2021.
    *   Each blood test was paired with the average dietary intake for the period preceding that blood test.
*   **Biomarker Analysis:**
    *   Correlating blood biomarkers with average daily calorie intake, macronutrients, and individual food amounts.
    *   Focus on "big picture" biomarkers including:
        *   Glucose
        *   Homocysteine
        *   Kidney function markers (3)
        *   Liver function markers (4)
        *   Major lipoproteins (e.g., VLDL, LDL)
        *   Immune cells
        *   Red blood cell related measures (e.g., RDW)
        *   Inflammation (High-sensitivity C-reactive protein)
        *   Composite biological age scores (PhenoAge, aging.ai)

## Key Findings: Biomarker Correlations with Calorie Intake

*   Average daily calorie intake was **not** significantly correlated with biological age scores (PhenoAge and aging.ai).
*   Four blood biomarkers were significantly correlated with calorie intake:
    *   Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)
    *   Very Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL)
    *   Platelets
    *   Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW)

## Detailed Biomarker Analysis

### Very Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL)

*   **LabCorp Reference Range:** 5-40 mg/dL.
*   **Aging Data:** VLDL increases with age. In a study of 3,100 men, VLDL increased from approximately 16 mg/dL in 15-19 year olds to about 29 mg/dL in 75-79 year olds. This represents an approximate doubling during aging.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** While direct all-cause mortality data for VLDL was not found, studies show increased risk for acute myocardial infarction, sudden coronary death, and other coronary deaths when VLDL is greater than 20 mg/dL.
*   **Conclusion:** Lower VLDL is better, especially below 20 mg/dL.
*   **Calorie Intake Correlation:** Higher calorie intake is significantly correlated with higher VLDL. This correlation is considered **going in the wrong direction**.

### Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW)

*   **LabCorp Reference Range:** 11.6-15.4%.
*   **What it Represents:** Variability in red blood cell size and volume. A normal RDW indicates red blood cells are of similar size, while a high RDW indicates a mix of large and small red blood cells.
*   **Aging Data:** RDW significantly increases with age, up to 95 years of age, in a small study.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** In a large study of 3,200,000 subjects, the lowest all-cause mortality risk was observed for RDW values between 8.1-12.5%. RDW greater than 13.1% (above the 75th percentile) was associated with significantly increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Conclusion:** Lower RDW is better.
*   **Calorie Intake Correlation:** Higher calorie intake is significantly correlated with higher RDW. This correlation is considered **going in the wrong direction**.

### Platelets

*   **LabCorp Reference Range:** 150-450 x 10^9/L.
*   **Aging Data:** Platelet levels decline with age. Individuals younger than 60 have levels around 235 x 10^9/L or less, while those older than 70 have levels around 210 x 10^9/L.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** The lowest all-cause mortality risk is associated with platelet counts between 200-300 x 10^9/L. Both lower (<200) and higher (≥300) values are associated with increased risk.
*   **Determining Optimal Range:** To determine if higher or lower within the 200-300 range is optimal, platelet correlations with other biomarkers were examined.
    *   **Significant Correlations (7 total):**
        *   Higher platelets correlated with higher VLDL (wrong direction, as lower VLDL is better).
        *   Higher platelets correlated with higher lymphocyte percentage (wrong direction, as lymphocyte percentage declines with aging).
        *   Higher platelets correlated with higher monocyte percentage (wrong direction, as monocytes increase with aging).
        *   Higher platelets correlated with higher Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) (wrong direction, as lower BUN is generally better based on aging and all-cause mortality data).
    *   **Net Correlation:** Three out of four examined correlations were in the wrong direction, suggesting that higher platelet counts within the 200-300 range might not be optimal.
*   **Calorie Intake Correlation:** Higher calorie intake is significantly correlated with higher platelet counts. This correlation is considered **going in the wrong direction**.

### Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)

*   **LabCorp Reference Range:** 6-24 mg/dL.
*   **Aging Data:** BUN increases with age. For women, it increases from around 11 mg/dL to over 20 mg/dL by age 90. For men, it increases from around 13 mg/dL to approaching 24 mg/dL by age 90. Aging data suggests lower BUN is better.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** BUN exhibits a U-shaped curve for all-cause mortality risk, with the lowest risk observed around 16 mg/dL. Values below and above this are associated with increased risk.
*   **Conclusion:** An optimal BUN range appears to be around 13-16 mg/dL, avoiding both very low and high values.
*   **Calorie Intake Correlation:** Higher calorie intake is significantly correlated with higher BUN. This correlation is considered **going in the wrong direction**.

## Overall Calorie Intake Recommendation

*   A higher average daily calorie intake is significantly correlated with four biomarkers (VLDL, RDW, platelets, BUN) going in the **wrong direction** for health and longevity.
*   There were no significant correlations with biomarkers going in the **right direction** for health.
*   This suggests a net negative correlation between calorie intake and these health biomarkers.
*   **Recommendation:** Aim for a calorie intake **below** the individual's average. For the upcoming blood test, the average daily calorie intake has been slightly less than 2,400 calories per day.
