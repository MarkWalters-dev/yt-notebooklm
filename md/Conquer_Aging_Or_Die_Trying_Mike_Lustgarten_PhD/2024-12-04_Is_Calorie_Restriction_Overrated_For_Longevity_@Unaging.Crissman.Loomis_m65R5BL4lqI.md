# 2024-12-04 Is Calorie Restriction Overrated For Longevity @Unaging.Crissman.Loomis

## Executive Summary

*   Calorie restriction (CR) appears to provide benefits primarily in smaller animal models, with the top 10% of animals by weight showing no benefit.
*   Humans live significantly longer than expected based on their body weight compared to other species, suggesting CR benefits may not directly translate.
*   In humans, lower BMI is associated with a 50% higher all-cause mortality risk compared to normal BMI, and CR practitioners often have very low BMIs.
*   Biomarkers like lymphocyte count and Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) are associated with lifespan in mice and humans, independent of CR status.
*   The optimal approach to longevity likely involves finding a CR magnitude that aligns with youthful biomarker profiles and low mortality risk, rather than simply aiming for the lowest possible BMI.

## Mouse Data

### Impact of Short-Lived Controls on Calorie Restriction Efficacy

*   Studies examining CR in various organisms (yeast, fruit flies, mice) suggest that CR benefits are most pronounced in the smallest individuals.
*   In many CR studies, the top 10% of animals by weight show no significant benefit from calorie restriction.
*   Conversely, benefits are observed predominantly in the bottom 10% of animals by weight.

### Recent Mouse Lifespan Study (960 Mice)

*   **Study Design:**
    *   960 female mice were divided into five groups.
    *   Groups:
        *   Ad libitum (eat as much as they want)
        *   1 day of fasting
        *   2 days of fasting
        *   20% Calorie Restriction (CR)
        *   40% Calorie Restriction (CR)
*   **Median Lifespan Analysis (900-day rule ≈ 30 months):**
    *   Ad libitum and 1-2 days of fasting showed median lifespans shorter than 900 days.
    *   20% CR also had a median lifespan around 900 days, suggesting no significant extension beyond this benchmark.
    *   40% CR demonstrated a median lifespan significantly beyond 900 days.
*   **Long-Lived Mice (Beyond 35 months):**
    *   Even in the ad libitum group, a notable number of mice lived longer than 35 months.
    *   Fasting and CR groups showed an increasing proportion of mice living beyond 35 months, with 40% CR having the most.

### Biomarkers Associated with Longer Lifespan in Mice

*   Independent of CR group designation, the following biomarkers were associated with longer lifespan:
    *   **Higher lymphocyte count** at a relatively young age (16 months).
    *   **Lower Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW)**.

## Human Evidence

### Longevity vs. Body Weight Comparison

*   A statistical analysis comparing lifespan and body weight across various species revealed:
    *   Mice tend to live for a shorter duration than expected given their body weight.
    *   Humans live significantly longer than expected for their physical size, approximately five times longer than predicted by weight alone.
*   This suggests that direct comparisons of longevity interventions across vastly different species may be misleading.

### BMI and All-Cause Mortality in Humans

*   **Observation:** If prolonged low calorie intake were the primary driver of longevity, individuals with the lowest body weight would be expected to live the longest. This is not observed.
*   **Data:**
    *   Individuals with the lowest BMI have a 50% higher all-cause mortality risk compared to those with a normal BMI (20-25).
    *   Mortality risk increases significantly only when BMI enters the obese range.
*   **Calorie Restriction Practitioners:** Many individuals practicing CR have a very low BMI, often around 18, which is associated with significantly increased all-cause mortality.
*   **Data Cleaning:** This data has been adjusted to remove the effects of smoking, activity levels, exercise, and other confounding factors.

### Biomarkers Associated with Longevity in Humans

*   The trends observed in mice regarding biomarkers and lifespan are mirrored in humans:
    *   **RDW:** Increases with age in humans, and a higher RDW is associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Lymphocytes:** Decline with age in humans, and lower lymphocyte levels are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.

## Optimal Longevity Approach

*   **Beyond Absolute CR:** The goal is not to achieve the absolute lowest body weight or BMI.
*   **Optimal Nutrition and Biomarkers:** The focus should be on finding the magnitude of CR that is associated with:
    *   The most youthful biomarker profile.
    *   The lowest all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Holistic Well-being:** Subjective feelings such as energy levels and hunger are also important indicators of an individual's optimal state.
