# 2023-08-15 Siim Land Podcast - Conquer Aging or Die Trying Michael Lustgarten PhD

## Executive Summary

*   **Data-Driven Longevity:** The most effective approach to slowing aging and reducing mortality risk involves rigorous, continuous tracking of objective biomarkers and correlating them with diet and lifestyle interventions.
*   **Calorie Restriction Benefits:** Lowering calorie intake, within a sustainable and healthy range that avoids malnutrition, is strongly associated with improved biomarker profiles and reduced biological age.
*   **Exercise Dose Optimization:** Overtraining, even with seemingly beneficial activities, can negatively impact healthspan. Finding an individualized, consistent exercise routine that balances intensity and recovery is crucial.
*   **Holistic Biomarker Focus:** Effective aging intervention requires monitoring a wide spectrum of biomarkers across all organ systems, not just metabolic health indicators.
*   **Consistency is Key:** Sustainable, long-term adherence to optimized diet, sleep, and exercise habits is more impactful than sporadic extreme measures.

## Journey and Methodology

Michael Lustgarten's journey began with a focus on "eat real food and exercise," evolving to incorporate objective biomarkers and detailed tracking. His methodology is characterized by:

*   **Extensive Data Collection:** Tracking blood biomarkers annually since 2007, with increasing frequency to seven times per year.
*   **Detailed Dietary Tracking:** Weighing and recording all food intake daily since 2015 to correlate with blood test results.
*   **Biomarker Correlation Analysis:** Identifying correlations between dietary components (macros, micros, specific foods) and approximately 25 blood biomarkers.
*   **Statistical Significance:** Utilizing a p < 0.05 threshold to determine meaningful correlations.
*   **Biological Age Tracking:** Using tests like the Dunedin Pace and PhenoAge to quantify biological age reduction.
*   **Expansion Beyond Blood Tests:** Incorporating epigenetics, telomere length, metabolomics, and microbiome health into the tracking and optimization strategy.

## Key Findings and Discoveries

### Biomarker Optimization

*   **Beyond Reference Ranges:** Standard reference ranges are population-based averages and not optimized for longevity. The goal is to achieve biomarker levels associated with youth and reduced all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Net Score Approach:** Each macro, micro, and food item is assigned a net score based on its correlation with multiple biomarkers, aiming to follow the majority of positive correlations.
*   **Biological Age Reduction:** Through this data-driven approach, Michael has achieved a consistent biological age 16-17 years younger than his chronological age.
*   **Individual Variability:** The effectiveness of different dietary approaches (e.g., carnivore vs. vegan) varies significantly between individuals, emphasizing the need for personalized data.

### Diet and Calorie Restriction

*   **Calorie Intake is Paramount:** Lowering calorie intake is associated with the most significant benefits in biomarker profiles.
*   **Sustainable Calorie Reduction:** Michael practices gradual calorie reduction, aiming for long-term changes rather than rapid, unsustainable weight loss.
*   **Defining Optimal Intake:** The "sweet spot" for calorie intake balances longevity benefits with maintaining muscle mass, strength, and function, avoiding the pitfalls of both undereating and overeating.
*   **Macronutrient Distribution:** Michael's current optimized diet is approximately 18% protein, 40% net carbohydrates, and 40-42% fat.
*   **Food Choices:** Prioritizes fish (sardines) due to positive biomarker correlations, while rarely consuming beef, eggs, and chicken. Full-fat yogurt negatively impacts his biomarkers, unlike low-fat yogurt.
*   **Fiber's Role:** High fiber intake (around 85g/day for Michael) is crucial for satiety and contributes to a beneficial biomarker profile.
*   **Saturated and Monounsaturated Fat:** Saturated and monounsaturated fats correlate with more biomarkers moving in the wrong direction, while omega-3 and omega-6 fats show positive correlations.
*   **Micronutrient Optimization:** Michael often exceeds Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for certain micronutrients based on biomarker correlations, aiming for optimal levels rather than just preventing deficiency.
*   **Junk Food Frequency:** Limiting "junk food" to one or two days a week helps prevent overeating and bingeing, which can negatively impact biomarkers.

### Exercise and Fitness

*   **Overtraining Risks:** Chronic overtraining, even in the pursuit of peak fitness, can be detrimental to longevity and healthspan.
*   **Focus on Strength and Function:** The primary goal is to maintain strength relative to body weight, not necessarily maximizing muscle mass or peak VO2 max.
*   **VO2 Max Nuance:** While a VO2 max in the low fifties is associated with reduced all-cause mortality, elite levels may not offer additive longevity benefits and can come at a cost.
*   **Individualized Exercise Dose:** The optimal exercise frequency and intensity are highly individual. Michael follows a four-day cycle for workouts, prioritizing recovery.
*   **Objective Recovery Metrics:** Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and resting heart rate are used as objective measures to guide training intensity and recovery.
*   **Compound Movements:** Focus on multi-joint exercises like pull-ups, push-ups, deadlifts, overhead presses, rows, and lunges.
*   **Mobility and Flexibility:** Incorporates mobility, calisthenics, and flexibility exercises, including dynamic movements.
*   **Strength Benchmarks:** Uses specific set and rep benchmarks for key exercises to track progress and identify potential declines.
*   **Leanness and Strength:** Achieving a lean physique with maintained strength is prioritized over extreme muscle mass.
*   **Consistency Over Elite Status:** Regular, consistent physical activity is more important for longevity than achieving elite athletic status.

### Sleep and Recovery

*   **Foundational Importance of Sleep:** Optimizing sleep quality and quantity is essential for physical and mental performance, long-term progress, and avoiding overeating of less nutritious foods.
*   **Time-Restricted Eating and Sleep:** Michael has found that eating the majority of his food earlier in the day, with a shorter eating window, significantly improves his sleep.

### Key Biomarkers for General Health

For individuals seeking to understand their health without extensive testing, the following are recommended:

*   **Standard Chemistry Panel (Chem Panel):** Provides insights into kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and glucose.
*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Assesses various blood cells, including immune cells, providing a broad overview of immune and organ system health.
*   **C-Reactive Protein (CRP):** An indicator of inflammation, with lower levels (<1 mg/L) being optimal for longevity.
*   **Hemoglobin A1c:** Measures average blood sugar over 2-3 months, a key indicator of metabolic health.
*   **Lipid Panel (LDL, HDL, Triglycerides, Total Cholesterol):** While complex and debated, these provide insights into cardiovascular risk.
*   **Kidney Function Markers (Creatinine, BUN, Uric Acid):** Crucial for assessing kidney health.
*   **Liver Function Markers (ALT, AST, Bilirubin):** Essential for evaluating liver health.

## Core Principles for Longevity

1.  **Test, Track, and Optimize:** Continuously monitor objective biomarkers and adjust lifestyle accordingly.
2.  **Conquer Aging or Die Trying:** Adopt a proactive, persistent approach to health and longevity.
3.  **Prioritize Sleep:** Ensure adequate, high-quality sleep.
4.  **Manage Calorie Intake:** Avoid overeating and maintain a healthy, lean body composition.
5.  **Consistent Exercise:** Engage in regular, sustainable physical activity.
6.  **Holistic Biomarker Monitoring:** Pay attention to a wide range of organ system markers.
7.  **Long-Term Perspective:** Focus on habits that can be maintained for a lifetime.

## The Future of Longevity and Personal Insights

Michael expresses a desire to live long enough to live forever, driven by the pursuit of scientific understanding and a passion for continued exploration. He emphasizes that future medicine will increasingly focus on optimizing biomarkers through personalized interventions. His personal journey highlights the importance of starting these health optimization efforts as early as possible, acknowledging the potential long-term impacts of early lifestyle choices. He is currently researching DHEA sulfate and its potential modulation through diet, particularly fish oil intake, drawing on his professional work with centenarian metabolomic data.
