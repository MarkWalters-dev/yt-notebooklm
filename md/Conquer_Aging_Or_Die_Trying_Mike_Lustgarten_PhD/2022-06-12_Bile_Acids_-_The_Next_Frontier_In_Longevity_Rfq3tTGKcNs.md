# 2022-06-12 Bile Acids - The Next Frontier In Longevity

## Executive Summary

*   Glycine supplementation significantly increased median lifespan by 4% in female mice and 6% in male mice. Long-lived humans (average age 97) had 10% higher blood glycine levels compared to their offspring (average age 67).
*   Ergothioneine supplementation extended median lifespan in fruit flies. However, blood levels of Ergothioneine were 40% lower in long-lived humans compared to their offspring.
*   Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) supplementation did not extend median or maximum lifespan in mice. Long-lived humans exhibited only 1% higher blood NR levels, a difference likely not biologically significant for longevity.
*   Blood levels of numerous primary and secondary bile acids were substantially higher (ranging from 16% to over 7-fold) in long-lived humans (average age 97) compared to their offspring (average age 67).
*   Bile acid levels are also significantly increased in established longevity models, including Little (dwarf) mice (which live longer) and mice on a methionine-restricted diet (known to extend lifespan).
*   Cholic Acid (CA) supplementation independently extended median lifespan by 7% in a progeroid mouse model, suggesting a causal role for this bile acid in extending lifespan in conditions of accelerated aging.

## Initial Longevity Interventions

### Glycine

Glycine supplementation was initiated at nine months of age in mice.

*   **Mouse Data:**
    *   Pooled data from three independent study sites (Jackson Lab, University of Michigan, University of Texas) showed that glycine supplementation significantly increased median lifespan by 4% in female mice. It did not extend maximum lifespan in female mice.
    *   In male mice, glycine supplementation significantly increased median lifespan by 6% and maximum lifespan by 6%.
    *   Overall, glycine extends lifespan in mice.

*   **Human Evidence:**
    *   Blood levels of glycine were compared between individuals aged 94-105 years (average 97 years) and their offspring aged 50-79 years (average 67 years).
    *   The older, long-lived group had 10% higher blood levels of glycine, a statistically significant finding (p < 0.05, FDR < 0.052).
    *   This suggests higher blood levels of glycine are associated with longevity in humans.

### Ergothioneine

*   **Fruit Fly Data:**
    *   In Canton-s strain female fruit flies, three different concentrations of Ergothioneine supplementation significantly extended median lifespan.
    *   In YW strain female fruit flies, two different concentrations of Ergothioneine also significantly extended median lifespan.
    *   Ergothioneine extends lifespan in fruit flies. Data on its effect in mice or other mammals is not yet available.

*   **Human Evidence:**
    *   Blood levels of Ergothioneine were compared between long-lived individuals (average 97 years) and their offspring (average 67 years).
    *   The older group showed a significant 40% reduction in blood levels of Ergothioneine compared to the younger group (p < 0.05, FDR < 0.05).
    *   This suggests that higher blood levels of Ergothioneine are not associated with longevity in humans, and in fact, lower levels were observed in the long-lived.

### Nicotinamide Riboside (NR)

*   **Mouse Data:**
    *   Pooled data from three independent study sites (Jackson Lab, University of Michigan, University of Texas) using the Interventions Testing Program (ITP) methodology.
    *   NR supplementation (1000 parts per million) was started at eight months of age in both female and male mice.
    *   **Female Mice:**
        *   Control median lifespan: 874 days.
        *   NR-supplemented median lifespan: 875 days. (p = 0.612, not significant).
        *   Control maximum lifespan: 1047 days.
        *   NR-supplemented maximum lifespan: 1068 days. (p = 0.99, not significant).
    *   **Male Mice:**
        *   Control median lifespan: 787 days.
        *   NR-supplemented median lifespan: 763 days. (p = 0.25, not significant).
        *   Control maximum lifespan: 1047 days.
        *   NR-supplemented maximum lifespan: 1019 days. (p = 0.99, not significant).
    *   NR did not extend lifespan in either female or male mice.

*   **Human Evidence:**
    *   Blood levels of Nicotinamide Riboside were compared between long-lived individuals (average 97 years) and their offspring (average 67 years).
    *   The older group showed a 1% higher level of blood NR, a statistically significant but likely not biologically meaningful difference.
    *   Given the mouse data, this small increase may not be sufficient to impact longevity.

## Bile Acids: The Next Frontier

### Bile Acids in Long-Lived Humans

*   A study comparing blood metabolites in long-lived individuals (average 97 years) and their offspring (average 67 years) revealed a striking abundance of primary and secondary bile acids in the older group.
*   Specific examples of increased bile acids in the long-lived group include:
    *   Glycocholate: 16% higher.
    *   Deoxycholate (DCA): 86% higher.
    *   Cholic Acid (CA): 22% higher (p < 0.05, FDR < 0.05).
    *   Ursodeoxycholic Acid (UDCA): 2.206-fold higher.
    *   Taurochenodeoxycholic Acid (TCDCA): 2.1-fold higher.
    *   Overall, the median increase across the list of bile acids was approximately 2-fold higher, with some individual bile acids, such as a particular form of Ursodeoxycholate, showing more than a 7-fold increase. This indicates a substantial elevation of numerous bile acids in long-lived people.

### Bile Acid Synthesis Pathway

**Cholesterol (in liver)**
-> Series of enzymatic steps
-> **Primary Bile Acids**:
    *   Cholic Acid (CA)
    *   Chenodeoxycholic Acid (CDCA)
-> **Conjugation with Taurine or Glycine**:
    *   Taurocholic Acid (TCA)
    *   Glycocholic Acid (GCA)
    *   Taurochenodeoxycholic Acid (TCDCA)
    *   Glycochenodeoxycholic Acid (GCDCA)
-> *Stored in gallbladder, released into intestine after a meal to promote lipid absorption.*
-> **Conversion by Gut Bacteria in Intestine**:
-> **Secondary Bile Acids**:
    *   Deoxycholic Acid (DCA)
    *   Ursodeoxycholic Acid (UDCA)
    *   Lithocholic Acid (LCA)

### Bile Acids in Longevity Animal Models

1.  **Little (dwarf) Mice:**
    *   Little (dwarf) mice have a mutation in the growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) receptor, leading to 99% reduced circulating growth hormone and reduced IGF-1.
    *   These mice exhibit a 23-25% increase in average lifespan and a 15% increase in maximum lifespan.
    *   Blood levels of primary and secondary bile acids are significantly increased in these long-lived Little (dwarf) mice compared to wild-type mice:
        *   Deoxycholic Acid (DCA): 3.7-fold higher.
        *   Cholic Acid (CA): 3.5-fold higher.
        *   Ursodeoxycholic Acid (UDCA): 2.8-fold higher.
        *   The sum of all measured bile acids was 4.2-fold higher.
    *   Notably, the specific bile acids that were higher in the Little (dwarf) mice (DCA, CA, UDCA) were also found to be higher in long-lived humans.

2.  **Methionine Restriction:**
    *   Dietary methionine restriction is a known intervention that extends lifespan in mice.
    *   Mice on a methionine-restricted diet showed a significant 6.6% increase in median survival and an increase in maximum survival.
    *   Liver levels of Cholic Acid (CA) were increased in mice on a methionine-restricted diet, indicating increased synthesis of this primary bile acid.

3.  **Progeroid Mouse Models:**
    *   Progeria is a mouse model of accelerated aging.
    *   In G609G progeroid mice, Cholic Acid (CA) levels are initially very low.
    *   When these progeroid mice were fed a methionine-restricted diet, Cholic Acid levels significantly increased.
    *   Dietary methionine restriction extended median lifespan by 20% in this progeroid mouse model, with a near-significant increase in maximum lifespan (p = 0.08). This again associates increased CA levels with longevity in an accelerated aging context.

### Causation: Bile Acid Supplementation

*   **Cholic Acid Supplementation in Progeroid Mice:**
    *   In a different progeroid mouse model (ZMPSTE knockout mice, an accelerated aging model), mice were fed either a control diet or a diet supplemented with 0.1% Cholic Acid (CA).
    *   Cholic Acid supplementation resulted in a 7% increase in median survival compared to controls.
    *   Maximum survival (20% survival) showed a borderline significant increase (p = 0.054).
    *   This data indicates that Cholic Acid supplementation can independently extend lifespan in a mouse model of accelerated aging.

The consistent association of higher bile acid levels with longevity in humans and various animal models, coupled with the causal effect of Cholic Acid supplementation in progeroid mice, positions bile acids as a promising area for future longevity research.
