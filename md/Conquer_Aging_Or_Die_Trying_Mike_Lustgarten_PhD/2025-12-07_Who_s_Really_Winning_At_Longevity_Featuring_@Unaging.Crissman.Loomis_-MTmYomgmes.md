## Physical Strength and Performance

A comparison of physical strength biomarkers among individuals aged 31 (Simland), 48 (Brian Johnson), and 55 (Chrisman-Loomis).

*   **Grip Strength:** All three individuals demonstrate strong grip strength, with Chrisman-Loomis slightly stronger than Brian Johnson, and Simland exceeding both. Grip strength is recognized as a robust indicator of overall health and cardiovascular fitness.
*   **Bench Press (Estimated One-Rep Max):**
    *   Chrisman-Loomis: 98 kg
    *   Brian Johnson & Simland: Significantly higher, with Simland achieving 136 kg.
*   **Squat (Estimated One-Rep Max):**
    *   Chrisman-Loomis: 160 kg. This is a consistent exercise for him, maintained at this level.
    *   Brian Johnson: Approximately 150 kg.
    *   Simland: Approximately 160 kg.
    *   For individuals training for over five years, these lifts typically represent maintenance rather than increasing strength.

**Context on Strength Biomarkers:**
Direct comparisons of strength across different age groups can be skewed by age-related physiological changes. Normalizing strength data to body weight offers a more equitable comparison. Single, infrequent measurements may not capture an individual's average performance, highlighting the importance of consistent tracking. Beyond peak strength, the ability to perform functional movements and maintain flexibility is crucial for longevity. Full range of motion in compound exercises like squats can contribute to improved flexibility.

Chrisman-Loomis is currently working on a muscle-up, an advanced gymnastic movement that targets a unique range of muscles not typically exercised through standard gym routines. This challenge helps build abdominal strength and functional range of motion. He also shared a past experience with "50-year-old shoulder," a condition of reduced shoulder range of motion, which he successfully resolved through a series of targeted exercises. Incorporating short, high-intensity Tabata workouts (e.g., jumping jacks, mountain climbers, burpees) 2-3 times per week has also maintained overall functional capacity.

## Body Composition

*   **Bone Mineral Density (BMD - grams/cm²):**
    *   Chrisman-Loomis: At age 45, his BMD was 1.128, placing him on the borderline of osteopenia. After 11 years of consistent weightlifting, his BMD has significantly increased, now well within the healthy "green range" (around the 40th percentile).
    *   Simland & Brian Johnson: Exhibit higher BMD, likely due to a history of consistent strength training from a younger age, or in Brian's case, a period of carrying more body weight.
    *   **Finding:** Consistent strength training is a primary driver for bone mineral density and effectively reverses age-related decline, representing a significant longevity win.
*   **Visceral Fat:**
    *   Simland: Possesses the lowest visceral fat levels, actively maintaining a very lean physique.
    *   Chrisman-Loomis: Has slightly less visceral fat than Brian Johnson.
    *   **Finding:** Visceral fat is a critical longevity biomarker. Maintaining low levels, comparable to a 20-year-old, is considered outstanding. Studies in rats demonstrate that removing visceral fat can extend lifespan by approximately 20%. Elevated visceral fat is linked to fatty liver and adverse metabolic health outcomes, including higher triglycerides and poorer glucose/HbA1c control.

## Hormonal Health

*   **Total Testosterone:** Chrisman-Loomis's levels are relatively lower compared to Simland and Brian Johnson. Levels below 300 ng/dL are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk, but the optimal range above this threshold for longevity remains debatable.
*   **Free Testosterone:** Chrisman-Loomis's levels fall between those of Brian Johnson and Simland. Calorie restriction (CR), a known longevity intervention in animal models, can lower overall androgen levels, including free testosterone. A lower threshold of approximately 5 pg/mL is associated with increased all-cause mortality risk, highlighting a complex interplay between CR, testosterone levels, and health outcomes.
*   **Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG):** Chrisman-Loomis's levels are the highest among the three. While lower SHBG is generally preferred, CR dramatically increases SHBG (>100 nmol/L), which binds to total testosterone, potentially lowering free testosterone. Conversely, SHBG increases naturally with aging and is associated with metabolic syndrome in non-CR populations, creating a nuanced interpretation of this biomarker.
*   **DHEA:** Chrisman-Loomis's levels are in the middle range. Tracking DHEA sulfate, a neurosteroid that declines with age, can serve as a valuable biomarker for adrenal function.

**Challenges in Hormonal Assessment:**
Testosterone levels fluctuate significantly throughout the day (highest in the morning) and can be influenced by factors like jet lag. Consistent testing conditions and longitudinal data are essential to differentiate normal variation from true age-related decline.

## Liver Function

Liver function biomarkers were assessed, with Chrisman-Loomis noting improved results in more recent tests.

*   **Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) & Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT):** Chrisman-Loomis's levels were significantly elevated (over 70 U/L) during marathon training but normalized to below 50 U/L within a month post-training.
    *   **Optimal Range:** High teens to low twenties.
*   **Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT):** GGT levels typically increase with aging.
    *   **Optimal Range:** Less than 12 U/L.
*   **Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP):**
    *   **Optimal Range:** Less than 48 U/L. Brian Johnson's levels are notably higher than this optimal range.
*   **Bilirubin:** A biomarker of red blood cell degradation.
    *   **Process:** Hemoglobin -> Heme -> Bilirubin
    *   **Youthful Levels:** Relatively low, consistent with Brian and Simland's values.
    *   **Centenarians:** Often display higher bilirubin levels (around 1 mg/dL or greater), which has been associated with longevity, possibly due to its antioxidant or neuroprotective properties. For individuals at age 55, aiming for the lower youthful levels is generally recommended.
*   **Albumin:** Albumin is the most concentrated protein in blood. Its levels decline with aging.
    *   **Optimal Range:** 4.5 to 4.8 g/dL or slightly higher. Chrisman-Loomis's albumin levels are considered excellent among the three.

**Standardization for Liver Biomarkers:**
To ensure accurate readings, it is crucial to standardize the timing of the last intense physical workout prior to a blood test. For instance, a workout on Friday is recommended for a Monday or Tuesday blood draw, allowing 3-4 days for recovery. This minimizes the impact of exercise-induced enzyme elevations. Direct visualization methods, such as ultrasound, can confirm liver health, complementing blood markers like triglycerides, which are indicative of fatty liver.

## Kidney Function

*   **Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR):** This calculation is highly influenced by creatinine levels and chronological age, which can lead to misinterpretations. High creatinine, resulting from intense exercise or creatine supplementation, can artificially lower eGFR, falsely suggesting impaired kidney function.
*   **Creatinine:**
    *   Chrisman-Loomis: Levels can be high following intense workouts.
    *   Brian Johnson: Levels are relatively high (1.21 mg/dL), likely influenced by daily heavy lifting and creatine supplementation.
    *   Simland: Lower, despite high muscle mass, suggesting less exercise influence or no creatine supplementation.
*   **Cystatin C:** This biomarker is considered less affected by muscle mass or diet than creatinine and increases with age.
    *   **Optimal Range:** Less than 0.7 mg/L for the lowest all-cause mortality risk.
    *   Brian Johnson: 0.87 mg/L, indicating potentially suboptimal kidney function. Levels can be influenced by diet; for one individual, reducing saturated fats (e.g., coconut butter, cacao beans) helped lower elevated Cystatin C.
*   **Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN):** Derived from the metabolism of amino acids from proteins and increases with high protein intake or declining kidney function, as well as with aging.
    *   **Optimal Range:** Lower is generally better, ideally around 12 mg/dL or less. Brian Johnson's BUN levels are higher than expected.
    *   **Mechanism of High BUN:** Elevated urea in the blood can degrade tight junctions in the intestinal epithelium, potentially leading to increased gut permeability and immune activation.
    *   **Low BUN:** Extremely low BUN (e.g., 5-6 mg/dL) can be indicative of severe liver failure, a rare condition.

**Conclusion on Kidney Function:**
The collective data for Brian Johnson – elevated creatinine, high Cystatin C, and higher BUN – suggests suboptimal kidney function. This may be addressable through dietary modifications.

## Inflammation Markers

*   **High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (HSCRP):**
    *   Chrisman-Loomis: Undetectable (<0.1 mg/L), indicating very low systemic inflammation.
    *   Brian Johnson: Approximately 0.3 mg/L.
    *   **Optimal Range:** Less than 0.3 mg/L, with lower values being more desirable. HSCRP increases with age, and higher levels are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   **White Blood Cell (WBC) Count:** The absolute WBC count is a broad measure; more granular analysis of its components is more informative.
    *   **Components:** Neutrophils and monocytes tend to increase with aging, while lymphocytes decrease.
    *   **Optimal Range (Total WBC, for reference):** 3.5 to 6 x 10^9/L. Brian Johnson's count (3.1 x 10^9/L) is slightly below this range.
    *   **Importance:** A detailed breakdown into neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes, and further subdivision of lymphocytes (e.g., CD4 and CD8 T-cells for an "immune health grade"), is necessary for a comprehensive assessment of immune system function and susceptibility to infections.

## Blood Cell Health

*   **Hemoglobin:** The oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells. Hemoglobin levels typically decline with aging.
    *   **Optimal Range (Men):** 14 to 15.9 g/dL. Levels above 16 g/dL are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   Chrisman-Loomis: 15.9 g/dL (at the upper end of the optimal range).
    *   Brian Johnson: Below the optimal range (<14 g/dL), which could be a concern. This low level might contribute to his stated improvements with Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) by enhancing oxygen delivery to tissues.
*   **Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW):** Measures the variability in the size of red blood cells. RDW typically increases with aging, and higher levels are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Optimal Range:** 11.4 to 12.5%.
    *   Chrisman-Loomis: Slightly above the optimal range.
    *   Simland & Brian Johnson: Closer to optimal.
    *   **Significance:** RDW is a significant predictor in several biological age clocks, with a higher RDW contributing to a higher calculated biological age.
*   **Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV):** Represents the average volume of red blood cells. MCV tends to increase with aging.
    *   **Youthful Phenotype:** Characterized by relatively small and uniformly sized red blood cells (target around 90 fL).
    *   Chrisman-Loomis & Brian Johnson: Levels are higher than this youthful target.
    *   Simland: Values are on target.
*   **Platelets:** Essential for blood clotting.
    *   **Optimal Range:** 200-300 x 10^9/L for the lowest all-cause mortality risk (this often follows a J or U-shaped curve).
    *   Chrisman-Loomis: Slightly higher than the others.
    *   Simland: Optimal.
    *   Brian Johnson: 165 x 10^9/L (considered too low, a potential red flag).
*   **Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH):** The average amount of hemoglobin in a red blood cell. This is not typically tracked as a primary biomarker, as other red blood cell metrics are deemed more critical for overall health assessment.

**Overall Blood Cell Health:**
Red blood cells are the most abundant human cell type. Therefore, tracking parameters such as total red blood cell count, hemoglobin levels, red blood cell volume (MCV), and variability in size (RDW) is fundamental for evaluating overall health and physiological function.

**Cost and Efficacy of Longevity Protocols:**
The significant cost associated with extensive biomarker testing (e.g., Brian Johnson's frequent tests at over $200 each) and various therapies (HBOT, stem cell treatments, a large number of supplements) raises questions about cost-effectiveness. The efficacy of over 100 supplements in achieving "optimal" biomarkers across the board requires rigorous correlation data to support their use.

## The Un-aging Challenge (2026)

The "Un-aging Challenge" is a free, community-based initiative designed to enhance health and longevity through structured lifestyle modifications.

**Results from 2025 Challenge:**

*   **Strength Gains:** Participants achieved an average of 65% increase in overall strength. Beginners often doubled their initial strength, while more experienced individuals like Chrisman-Loomis saw approximately a 10% increase, partly aided by creatine supplementation. Collectively, participants lifted an amount of weight equivalent to a fully loaded semi-truck.
*   **Walking Achievement:** Over a three-month period, the team collectively walked 11 million steps, comparable to walking the distance from Anchorage, Alaska, to Miami, Florida.
*   **Health Improvements:** Participants reported significant anecdotal benefits, including improved sleep quality and reduced snoring. While not a primary weight loss program, some participants also experienced weight reduction.
*   **Biomarker Tracking:** Participants are encouraged to track Heart Rate Variability (HRV), resting heart rate, and VO2 Max using personal wearable devices.
*   **Future Development:** The program aims to increase participation by scaling the number of teams, simplifying data input mechanisms, and potentially developing a mobile application for more robust data collection and reporting. The focus remains on collective achievement and individual improvement, rather than competitive leaderboards.
