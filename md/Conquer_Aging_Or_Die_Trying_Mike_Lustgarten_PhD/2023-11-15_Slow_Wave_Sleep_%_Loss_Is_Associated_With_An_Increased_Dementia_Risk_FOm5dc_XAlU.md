# 2023-11-15 Slow Wave Sleep % Loss Is Associated With An Increased Dementia Risk

## Executive Summary

*   Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) percentage, defined as total SWS divided by total sleep time, significantly declines with age, dropping from an average of 25% in five-year-olds to 8% in 90-year-olds.
*   A decrease in SWS percentage over approximately 17 years is associated with a higher cumulative incidence risk of dementia (including Alzheimer's, vascular, and other dementias), compared to individuals with stable or increasing SWS percentage.
*   Consumer fitness trackers, such as Whoop, have been validated against polysomnography (PSG, the gold standard) for accurately quantifying SWS duration and total sleep time, enabling personal tracking of SWS percentage.
*   Personal data tracked over several years showed a significant increase in SWS percentage from 21.2% in 2019 to 24.8% in 2023, contrasting the general age-related decline.
*   In personal data, a significant inverse correlation was observed between body weight and SWS percentage, indicating that lower body weight correlated with higher SWS percentage.

## Introduction to Slow Wave Sleep

Sleep progresses through several stages: Awake -> REM sleep -> Stage 1 & 2 (light sleep) -> Stage 3 & 4 (Slow Wave Sleep, SWS).

SWS is predominantly observed in the first half of the night, becoming considerably less, if present at all, in the second half of the night, where REM sleep dominates. Slow Wave Sleep percentage is calculated as the total SWS duration divided by the total sleep time.

## Age-Related Decline in SWS Percentage

A meta-analysis of 65 studies, including individuals from 5 to 90 years old, shows a clear age-related decline in SWS percentage:
*   **Youth (5 years old):** Average SWS percentage is approximately 25%.
*   **Young Adult (20 years old):** Average SWS percentage is approximately 20%.
*   **Elderly (90 years old):** Average SWS percentage is approximately 8%.
This trend indicates a substantial reduction in SWS as individuals age.

## SWS Percentage Loss and Dementia Risk

A recently published paper investigated the association between SWS percentage changes and cumulative dementia incidence.
*   People who exhibited a decrease in SWS percentage over an average 17-year period had a higher incident risk of being diagnosed with dementia (including Alzheimer's disease-related, vascular, and other dementias).
*   This increased risk was observed when compared with people whose SWS percentage remained stable or increased over the same period.

## Tracking SWS Percentage

Slow Wave Sleep percentage can be tracked using fitness trackers. A comparison of Whoop data against polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard for sleep studies, demonstrates its accuracy for SWS and total sleep time.

### Polysomnography (PSG) Methodology
PSG is considered the gold standard for sleep studies because it comprehensively monitors various physiological parameters:
*   Electrodes monitor brain waves.
*   Eye and muscle movements are tracked.
*   Heart rate and breathing are measured.
*   Respiratory effort is assessed.
*   Oxygen saturation is recorded via pulse oximetry.

### Whoop vs. PSG Validation Results
A study comparing Whoop data to PSG showed:
*   **Slow Wave Sleep Duration:** Whoop quantified an average of 80 minutes per subject, while PSG calculated 84 minutes. This difference was not statistically significant, indicating Whoop is as effective as PSG for detecting and quantifying SWS.
*   **Total Sleep Time:** Whoop calculated an average of 359 minutes per person, and PSG calculated 350 minutes. This difference was also not statistically significant, confirming Whoop's accuracy for total sleep time.
*   **REM Sleep Duration:** Whoop calculated an average of 104 minutes per person, while PSG calculated 89 minutes. This was a significant difference (p < 0.05), indicating Whoop overestimated REM sleep by about 16 minutes. Therefore, Whoop may not be optimal for tracking REM sleep.

Overall, Whoop's calculations for SWS duration and total sleep time are comparable to the gold standard PSG, making it a viable tool for tracking SWS percentage.

## Personal SWS Percentage Trends

Personal data collected over more than 1600 days (May 2019 to early November 2023) using Whoop allowed for the calculation and analysis of SWS percentage:
*   **2019 Average:** 21.2%
*   **2020 Average:** 21.3% (Not significantly different from 2019)
*   **2021 Average:** 21.5% (Not significantly different from 2020)
*   **2022 Average:** 24.1% (Significantly better than 2021, p < 0.05)
*   **2023 Average (thus far):** 24.8% (Significantly better than 2022, p = 0.002)

These data show a significant increase in SWS percentage since 2019, which is potentially beneficial given the association between SWS percentage decline and increased dementia risk.

## Factors Influencing SWS Percentage

One variable potentially underlying the observed increase in SWS percentage in personal data is body weight.
*   A significant inverse correlation was found between slow wave sleep percentage and body weight (p < 0.05, negative correlation coefficient).
*   This indicates that a relatively higher body weight is significantly correlated with a lower SWS percentage.
*   Conversely, a relatively lower body weight is significantly correlated with a higher SWS percentage.
*   Over the past 2.5 to 3 years, a gradual reduction in body weight coincided with the observed improvements in SWS percentage.

Future investigations will explore further subdivisions of body weight, such as calorie intake (caloric excess/deficit), diet composition, and daily activity levels, and their correlations with SWS percentage.
