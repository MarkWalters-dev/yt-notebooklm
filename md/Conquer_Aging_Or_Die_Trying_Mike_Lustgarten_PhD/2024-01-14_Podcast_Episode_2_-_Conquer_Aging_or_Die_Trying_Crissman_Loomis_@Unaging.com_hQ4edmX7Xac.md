## Executive Summary

*   **Diet & Longevity:** Sustained shifts to healthier diets, rich in whole grains and legumes, can increase life expectancy by up to 10 years, while sugar-sweetened beverages and processed meats are strongly associated with higher mortality risk.
*   **Glucosamine's Impact:** Daily glucosamine chondroitin supplementation is associated with a 15% reduction in all-cause mortality, particularly linked to lung diseases like COPD and pneumonia.
*   **NAD Production Strategies:** Low-dose nicotinic acid (60mg/day) effectively boosts NAD levels, similar to 1000mg of NMN, but high doses may negatively impact epigenetic aging pace. Dietary sources of trigonelline (e.g., coffee, chickpeas) are being investigated as a promising alternative for natural NAD enhancement without adverse epigenetic effects.
*   **Methyl Donors:** NAD precursor supplementation can deplete methyl donors; dietary adjustments (e.g., specific amino acids like proline betaine from oranges) are being explored to maintain methylation balance and reduce homocysteine levels.
*   **Heat Therapy Benefits:** Regular heat exposure through saunas (4-7 times/week) or hot baths is linked to a 40% reduction in premature death, improved VO2 max, and reduced cardiovascular events, suggesting a body-hacking effect that mimics exercise.
*   **Oral Health & Lifespan:** Brushing teeth specifically in the evening and daily flossing significantly reduce all-cause mortality. Alcohol-based mouthwashes are detrimental, potentially disrupting oral bacteria that regulate systemic blood pressure.

## Diet and Life Expectancy

A study examining healthy lifestyle factors on life expectancy identified physical activity, smoking, diet quality, moderate alcohol consumption, and BMI as key variables.

*   Women in the highest quintile of the Alternative Healthy Eating Index showed a **five-year gain** in life expectancy compared to those in the lowest quintile.
*   Men in the highest quintile showed a **four-year gain**.

Another study indicates that life expectancy can increase by up to **ten years** following sustained shifts towards healthier diets. This particular study's fully adjusted model (controlling for BMI, calories, age, sex, and other variables) provides specific insights into food groups and all-cause mortality risk:

*   **Strongest Associations with Increased Risk:**
    *   Sugar-sweetened beverages: 65% higher all-cause mortality risk.
    *   Processed meat: 45% higher all-cause mortality risk.
    *   Refined grains: Significantly increased risk across all higher intake quintiles.
*   **Food Groups with Potential Benefits:**
    *   **Nuts:** An intake of approximately one small handful (less than an ounce) per day was associated with an 18% reduction in premature death (Q2 quintile), with higher intakes showing more variability in risk reduction.
    *   **Eggs:** Moderate intake (e.g., about an egg every other day) was associated with a significant reduction in risk in the Q2 quintile. However, the highest quintile of egg intake was associated with increased risk.
    *   **Whole Grains:** Consistently associated with significant benefit in reducing all-cause mortality risk across most higher intake quintiles.
    *   **Legumes:** Generally healthy, though the range of effect on hazard ratio was wide (10% to 525% reduction), suggesting variability or specific dosage effects.
    *   **Milk:** Was observed to be generally healthy, particularly with higher amounts; this finding might be specific to the UK population studied.
    *   **Red Meat & White Meat:** Not significantly associated with increased or decreased all-cause mortality risk in this adjusted model.
    *   **Fruits & Vegetables:** While generally considered healthy, this specific dataset did not show as large a "boost" in mortality reduction (less than 10%) compared to other food groups like nuts or whole grains. This may be due to low baseline consumption levels in the general population, or potential pesticide residues in non-organic produce impacting outcomes. Fruit fiber, specifically, was not significantly associated with reduced risk, while vegetable fiber was.

### Considerations in Epidemiological Studies
*   **Adjustment for Comorbidities:** Fully adjusting for a wide range of comorbidities (e.g., lung disease, liver disease) is crucial in epidemiological studies to avoid reverse causation bias. Studies that do not fully adjust can show misleading associations, such as U-shaped curves for LDL cholesterol where lower levels appear harmful. When fully adjusted, lower LDL is not associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk.
*   **Dosage Specificity:** The optimal intake for certain foods, like nuts and eggs, is dosage-sensitive, with benefits often seen at moderate levels but diminishing or reversing at very high or very low intakes.
*   **Pesticide Residue:** Studies on pesticide residue in fruits and vegetables suggest that high-residue produce (about a third of total intake) may be linked to higher cancer rates at increased doses, potentially impacting overall longevity benefits. Conversely, whole grains and legumes generally show lower pesticide burdens.

## Supplements

The approach to supplements emphasizes prioritization of lifestyle changes. While many novel compounds are explored, robust evidence for reducing premature death is often lacking.

### Glucosamine Chondroitin

Glucosamine chondroitin, traditionally used for knee health, shows promising longevity benefits. A UK Biobank study indicated approximately a **15% reduction in all-cause mortality**, with effects particularly clustered around lung diseases (e.g., COPD, pneumonia).

### NAD Precursors (NMN, Nicotinic Acid)

NAD levels naturally decline with age, and boosting them is a target for anti-aging.
*   Baseline blood cell NAD levels without supplementation are typically low (20-25 micromolar) compared to 30-year-olds (median 40 micromolar).
*   **Nicotinic Acid (Niacin):**
    *   An initial experiment with 600mg/day resulted in NAD levels of 67 micromolar, but also pushed epigenetic aging pace to an outlier status (10 standard deviations from average).
    *   A reduced dose of **60mg/day** of nicotinic acid achieved a similar NAD increase (around 40% from baseline) to 1000mg of NMN, without negatively impacting the epigenetic aging pace (which remained in the usual range of 0.76-0.82).
*   **NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide):**
    *   Two grams per day of NMN increased NAD to 61 micromolar. The impact on epigenetic aging pace is currently being evaluated to determine if high NAD levels or high nicotinic acid doses specifically affect aging biomarkers.
*   **Methyl Donor Depletion:** Supplementation with NAD precursors (NMN, NR, niacin, nicotinamide, nicotinic acid) is known to deplete methyl donors. This can lead to increased homocysteine levels, which are linked to cardiovascular issues and could potentially affect methylation age.
    *   **Methyl Donor Replenishment Strategies:**
        *   TMG (Trimethylglycine) at up to 3 grams/day did not effectively lower homocysteine.
        *   Serine + B6 (6g serine, 40-50mg B6) did not lower homocysteine.
        *   Methyl B12 showed some reduction in homocysteine.
        *   **Dietary Strategy:** Incorporating oranges into the diet is being tested as a source of methyl donors. Oranges contain proline betaine, a trimethylated amino acid, which may help maintain methylation balance and reduce homocysteine. Fish intake already provides ample B12.

### Trigonelline

Trigonelline is being explored as a dietary compound that could naturally increase NAD levels without the potential epigenetic side effects seen with high-dose nicotinic acid.

*   **Dietary Sources:**
    *   **Coffee:** The most abundant source, approximately 2,200 micrograms per gram (dry weight).
    *   **Chickpeas:** A significant source, containing about 350 micrograms per gram.
*   **Strategy:** Substituting high trigonelline foods (e.g., chickpeas) for lower trigonelline whole grains (e.g., barley, oats) in the diet to increase intake.

## Healthy Habits (Beyond Diet & Exercise)

### Heat Therapy (Sauna, Hot Baths)

Studies, predominantly from Finland and Japan, show significant health benefits from regular heat exposure.

*   **Sauna:**
    *   Regular use (4-7 times a week) is associated with a **40% reduction in premature death**.
    *   **RCTs** demonstrate improved lactate threshold and VO2 max, key indicators of cardiovascular health and performance.
    *   These benefits are observed even when compared to individuals using saunas once a week.
    *   Heat exposure may "hack" the body into mimicking exercise, promoting vasodilation and potentially reducing blood pressure.
*   **Hot Baths:** Studies from Japan indicate similar cardiovascular benefits from frequent hot baths, including reduced strokes and heart attacks. This effect appears independent of BMI, as Japan has a low average BMI.
*   **Optimal Timing:** Benefits may be enhanced when heat therapy is performed after aerobic exercise (e.g., 15 minutes after a 30-minute run).
*   **Biomarkers:** Beyond improvements in VO2 max, lactate threshold, and blood pressure, the reduction in cardiovascular death and events suggests positive impacts on cardiovascular health, though specific data on soft plaque reduction or calcification changes from heat therapy are not broadly available.

### Oral Care

Good oral hygiene practices extend beyond fresh breath and are directly linked to longevity.

*   **Brushing:** Brushing teeth specifically in the **evening before bed** is associated with longevity benefits and reduced premature death. Morning brushing primarily aids breath freshness but does not show a similar longevity effect.
*   **Flossing:** Daily flossing is crucial for longevity and reducing premature death.
*   **Regular Cleaning:** Routine dental cleanings (e.g., every six months to a year) help minimize plaque buildup.
*   **Mouthwash:**
    *   **Alcohol-based mouthwashes:** Should be avoided as they can kill beneficial oral bacteria involved in systemic blood pressure regulation, potentially negatively affecting blood pressure.
    *   **Non-alcohol based mouthwashes:** Generally do not show benefit in improving the oral microbiome or reducing all-cause mortality.
*   **Oral Microbiome Management:** Beyond basic hygiene, managing specific oral bacteria is emerging as a critical aspect of health. Certain bacteria are linked to systemic diseases:
    *   *Serratia marcescens:* Can cause sepsis.
    *   *Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis):* Linked to Alzheimer's disease (found in patient brains) and cardiovascular disease (found in plaques, can cause disease in mice).
    *   Antibiotic use for oral bacteria carries risks of obliterating the gut microbiome and fostering antibiotic-resistant strains. Research into optimal oral microbiome composition and maintenance is ongoing.

## Alcohol Consumption

A meta-analysis published in March 2023, analyzing 107 studies and 4.8 million people, provides comprehensive data on alcohol and all-cause mortality.

*   **Key Finding:** Low-volume alcohol drinking is **not associated with protection from death** from all causes.
*   **Comparison Groups:**
    *   **Selection Bias:** Using "occasional drinkers" (less than 1.3 grams per day, about one drink per week) as a reference group helps minimize "sick quitter" bias, where former drinkers may have stopped due to existing health issues, making abstainers appear unhealthier. Lifetime non-drinkers, who have never consumed alcohol, are also considered.
*   **Dose-Response:**
    *   **Very Occasional Drinking (less than 1.3 grams/day):** Not associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk compared to non-drinkers.
    *   **Low Volume (up to 2 drinks/day, or less than 25 grams/day):** In fully adjusted models, there was a trend towards a decreased risk of all-cause mortality. While not always statistically significant when compared to occasional drinkers (which could be due to reduced statistical power in heavily adjusted models), this range is generally not shown to be harmful, suggesting it's permissible for those who enjoy it responsibly.
    *   **Increased Risk:** Consumption of 25-44 grams per day (approximately 2.5-4 drinks/day) showed an increased risk of all-cause mortality.
    *   **Significant Increase in Risk:** Greater than 45 grams of alcohol per day (more than 4 drinks/day) was significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Other Considerations:**
    *   **DHEA Sulfate:** Alcohol intake has been linked to relatively higher levels of DHEA sulfate, a steroid hormone that declines with aging. DHEA is a precursor in the pathway: Cholesterol -> DHEA -> Testosterone. While the benefit is uncertain, it might influence hormone levels.
    *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV) & Resting Heart Rate (RHR):** Even small amounts of alcohol can negatively impact HRV and RHR for some individuals.
    *   **Sleep:** While moderate alcohol consumption may subjectively aid in falling asleep for some, heavier consumption is known to impair sleep quality.
    *   **Individualized Approach:** Given the nuanced findings, a personalized approach to alcohol consumption is recommended, considering individual risk factors (e.g., family history of alcoholism) and monitoring personal biomarkers.
