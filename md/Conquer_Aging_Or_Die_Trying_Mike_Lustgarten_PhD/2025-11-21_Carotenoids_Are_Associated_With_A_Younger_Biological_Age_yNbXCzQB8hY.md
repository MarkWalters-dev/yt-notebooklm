# 2025-11-21 Carotenoids Are Associated With A Younger Biological Age

**Executive Summary**
*   Dietary intake of total carotenoids is associated with biological age, as assessed by the Phenylage clock.
*   Lower intakes of total carotenoids, including alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lycopene, and lutein-zeaxanthin, are significantly linked to an older biological age.
*   Higher intakes of these specific carotenoids are significantly associated with a younger biological age.
*   Beta-cryptoxanthin demonstrated a unique pattern, suggesting a potential "sweet spot" for optimal association with biological age, where both very low and very high intakes might be less favorable.
*   These findings suggest that a diet rich in carotenoids may play a role in mitigating biological aging.

## Study Findings on Carotenoids and Biological Age

In this study, researchers investigated the association between dietary intake of total carotenoids and biological age, utilizing the Phenylage clock. The total carotenoid intake assessed included alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and lutein-zeaxanthin.

The analysis revealed significant associations:
*   **Low Intakes:** Relatively low dietary intakes of total carotenoids (specifically alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lycopene, and lutein-zeaxanthin) were significantly associated with an older Phenylage (indicating a higher biological age).
*   **High Intakes:** Conversely, relatively high intakes of these carotenoids were significantly associated with a younger Phenylage (indicating a lower biological age).

An exception to this trend was observed for **beta-cryptoxanthin**:
*   Very low intakes of beta-cryptoxanthin were associated with an older Phenylage.
*   While higher intakes trended towards an older Phenylage, this association lost statistical significance at very high levels. This suggests a potential "sweet spot" for beta-cryptoxanthin intake, where moderate levels may be optimally associated with a younger biological age.

The study identifies associations between dietary carotenoid intake and biological age, but further research is needed to establish causation.
