## Executive Summary

*   Strict, long-term calorie restriction in individuals with a history of binge eating can lead to significant overconsumption if planned "cheat" meals are not strategically managed.
*   A post-blood test dietary reset, including planned indulgence with immediate disposal of remaining "junk" food, has historically prevented binges by addressing cravings.
*   A failure in this strategy resulted in a 5,700-calorie binge, representing a 3,500-calorie surplus over maintenance.
*   The recovery approach involved a controlled, two-day caloric deficit (600 kcal and 1000 kcal) followed by a swift return to normal dietary intake, specifically to avoid a full "binge-purge" cycle.
*   Despite the binge, the overall average daily caloric intake over a 49-day period remained close to the target, suggesting that a single large caloric deviation can be mitigated without resorting to extreme compensatory behaviors.

## Current Diet Approach

Historically, calorie restriction led to weekly binges, characterized by consuming several thousand calories over maintenance, followed by extreme fasting (binge-purge cycle). This pattern was successfully broken four years ago by implementing a structured diet focusing on food volume, fiber, and exercise. A key strategy for maintaining calorie restriction without triggering binges involves planned "cheat" days.

**Standard Post-Blood Test "Cheat" Day Protocol:**
*   Immediately following each blood test (approximately eight times per year), a pre-planned indulgence occurs.
*   Foods consumed are typically those craved during the 50-day period between tests (e.g., peanut butter and chocolate, pizza).
*   During this 2-4 day period, strict macro and micro targets are temporarily disregarded.
*   A crucial step is the immediate disposal of any leftover "junk" food to prevent further consumption and maintain control.
*   This approach has successfully maintained calorie intake within targeted, small ranges for four years, avoiding large caloric excesses.

## Binge Experience

On February 4, following a blood test, the standard protocol was initiated with a workout day intake of approximately 2,300 calories, which is typical for a workout day (non-workout days target 2,050-2,100 calories). Fiber intake was half the usual due to the cheat day.

The breakdown occurred on February 5. Instead of disposing of leftover junk food, specifically cookie dough, it was kept in the house. This led to an unplanned, significant binge:
*   **Calorie Intake:** 5,700 calories on February 5.
*   **Caloric Surplus:** This represents a 3,500-calorie excess over the individual's maintenance intake of 2,100-2,200 calories, equivalent to almost three days' worth of food.
*   **Foods Consumed:** Cookie dough (raw), chocolate chips, grape jelly, peanut butter.
*   **Trigger:** Keeping extra cookie dough in the house, initially planned for a potential third cheat day, served as a potent trigger, leading to uncontrolled consumption beyond the pre-planned indulgence.

## Post-Binge Recovery Strategy

Recognizing a history of binge-purge behavior (where "purge" refers to extreme fasting, not vomiting), the recovery strategy focused on mitigating the caloric surplus without re-entering an unhealthy cycle.

**Post-Binge Recovery Protocol (February 6-8):**
*   **Day 1 (February 6):** Calorie intake was reduced to 600 calories. This represented approximately 1,500 calories under the usual intake.
    *   *Calorie balance:* 3,500 (binge surplus) - 1,500 (deficit) = 2,000 calories remaining surplus.
*   **Day 2 (February 7):** Calorie intake was 1,000 calories. This represented approximately 1,100 calories under the usual intake.
    *   *Calorie balance:* 2,000 (remaining surplus) - 1,100 (deficit) = 900-1,000 calories remaining surplus over the four-day period.
*   **Day 3 (February 8):** Calorie intake returned to approximately 2,000 calories, very close to the usual daily target. This decision was made to avoid prolonging the caloric deficit, which historically could trigger a deeper binge-purge cycle.

**Outcome and Long-Term Impact:**
Despite the 5,700-calorie binge, the strategic post-binge recovery minimized the overall impact.
*   The average daily calorie intake for the 49-day period prior to the February 4 test was 2,120 calories.
*   Even with the binge and subsequent recovery, the current average intake is approximately 2,176 calories, with a target aim of 2,150 calories.
*   This indicates that a single significant caloric deviation, when managed strategically, can be absorbed into the broader dietary pattern without severely impacting long-term average caloric intake or anticipated biomarker results, especially being 45 days away from the next blood test. The experience highlights the importance of learning from such events to reinforce preventative measures.
