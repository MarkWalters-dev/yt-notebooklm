# 2020-10-30 Slower Biological Aging In People On A Calorie Restricted Diet

### Executive Summary

*   Calorie restriction (CR) significantly extends both average and maximum lifespan in various animal models, including mice, flies, yeast, and worms.
*   The human CALERIE (Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy) study demonstrated that CR slows biological aging. After two years, the CR group showed a 0.2-year increase in biological age, compared to a 1.4-year increase in the ad libitum control group.
*   Even moderate levels of calorie restriction (e.g., ~12% average reduction over 24 months) were sufficient to achieve these biological age-slowing effects; no statistically significant difference was found between participants restricting less than 10% vs. 10% or more.
*   The Klemera-Doubal Biological Age (KDM) calculator, based on 10 biomarkers, strongly correlates with chronological age (0.88-0.92) and is a superior predictor of all-cause mortality risk compared to chronological age.

## Mouse and Animal Model Data

Calorie restriction is well known to extend lifespan in a variety of animal models. Studies in mice demonstrate that various levels of calorie restriction (e.g., 47%, 69%, 75%, 44%) extend both average and maximum lifespan. Similar lifespan extension has been observed in other animal models including flies, yeast, and worms.

## Human Evidence: The CALERIE Study

Direct longitudinal studies to assess the impact of calorie restriction on human lifespan are impractical due to the long human lifespan. Therefore, researchers use biological age as a surrogate marker to evaluate the effects of calorie restriction on human aging.

The CALERIE study, published in 2018, investigated the effect of calorie restriction on biological aging in humans.

**CALERIE Study Methodology:**

*   **Cohort:** Relatively young, average age 38 years.
*   **BMI:** Average 25.1 (slightly above the normal/lean threshold of <25).
*   **Groups:**
    *   70 participants: Ad libitum controls (ate their normal diet).
    *   130 participants: Randomized to a calorie restriction (CR) group, with a goal of 25% caloric reduction.

**CALERIE Study Results: Biological Age**

At baseline, there was no significant difference in biological age between the ad libitum and CR groups. Participants' average biological age (37 years) was nearly identical to their chronological age (38 years) at the start of the study.

*   **After one year:**
    *   Ad libitum group: Experienced a 0.71-year increase in biological age.
    *   CR group: Experienced only a 0.11-year increase in biological age.
    *   The 95% confidence intervals for these two groups did not overlap, indicating a statistically significant difference in the rate of biological aging.
*   **After two years:**
    *   Ad libitum group: Experienced a 1.4-year increase in biological age.
    *   CR group: Experienced only a 0.2-year increase in biological age.
    *   This demonstrates a significant reduction in biological aging in the CR group over the two-year study.

**Actual Calorie Restriction Achieved in CALERIE:**

The actual calorie restriction achieved by the CR group varied over the study duration:

*   **First 6 months:** Participants reduced their daily calorie intake by an average of 480 calories (from a 2467 kcal baseline), equivalent to approximately 20% CR.
*   **Remaining 18 months:** Participants reduced their daily calorie intake by an average of 234 calories, equivalent to approximately 9-10% CR.
*   **Cumulative 24 months:** The CR group reduced their calorie intake by an average of about 12% over the entire study period.

**Impact of CR Level on Biological Age**

Within the CR group, participants were analyzed based on their level of restriction: less than 10% CR versus 10% or more CR. Although visual trends might suggest differences, these sub-groups did not show statistically significant differences in the rate of biological aging. This suggests that even a moderate level of calorie restriction (e.g., less than 10%) can contribute to the observed biological age-slowing effects.

## Biological Age Calculator: The Klemera-Doubal Method (KDM)

The biological age calculator used in the CALERIE study is the Klemera-Doubal Biological Age (KDM), first published in 2006.

**KDM Biomarkers (10 + Age):**

*   Albumin
*   Alkaline phosphatase
*   Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
*   C-reactive protein (CRP)
*   Creatinine
*   Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c, calculated from glucose levels)
*   Systolic blood pressure
*   Total cholesterol
*   Uric acid
*   White blood cell count

*Note: Five of these biomarkers overlap with Levine's Phenotypic Age calculator.*

**Correlation of KDM with Chronological Age**

*   In the CALERIE study (n=200), the KDM demonstrated a strong correlation with chronological age (correlation coefficient = 0.88).
*   Larger datasets typically provide more robust correlations due to reduced variability. In a larger cohort from the 2009-2010 NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) study (n=7,700), the KDM showed an even stronger correlation with chronological age (correlation coefficient = 0.92).
*   For context, Levine's Phenotypic Age calculator achieves correlation coefficients of 0.94 and 0.96 in studies with over 9,000 subjects. This suggests that the KDM offers comparable predictive power for biological age.

**KDM and All-Cause Mortality Risk**

The Klemera-Doubal Biological Age calculator (KDM) has been demonstrated to be a superior predictor of all-cause mortality risk compared to chronological age. In a large study (NHANES III, n > 9,000), a higher KDM biological age was more strongly associated with increased all-cause mortality risk than chronological age alone.
