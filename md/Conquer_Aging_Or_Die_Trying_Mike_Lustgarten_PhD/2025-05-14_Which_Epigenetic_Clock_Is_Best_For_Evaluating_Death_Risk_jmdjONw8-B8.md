# 2025-05-14 Which Epigenetic Clock Is Best For Evaluating Death Risk

## Executive Summary

*   Six out of ten epigenetic clocks analyzed were significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk.
*   GrimAge version two demonstrated the highest hazard ratio (51% increased risk) for all-cause mortality associated with a relatively older epigenetic age.
*   GrimAge version two's 95% confidence interval (1.33 to 1.7) did not overlap with those of Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, and Vidal Bravo, suggesting superior predictive power for mortality.
*   GrimAge is derived from an epigenetic prediction of seven proteins (leptin, PAI-1, adrenomedullin, beta-2 microglobulin, GDF-15, cystatin C, TEMP1) plus sex, smoking, and age. GrimAge version two additionally includes hs-CRP and HbA1c.
*   Beta-2 microglobulin and cystatin C are strongly correlated (correlation coefficient > 0.7) with the overall GrimAge score and are commercially available, offering a potential cost-effective proxy for GrimAge assessment.

## Epigenetic Clocks and All-Cause Mortality

A study involving over 2,100 individuals with an average age of 64 and a median follow-up of 17.5 years assessed the association of ten different epigenetic clocks with all-cause mortality.

### Significant Associations with All-Cause Mortality:

The following six clocks showed a significant association with all-cause mortality risk:
*   Horvath
*   Hannum
*   PhenoAge
*   Vidal Bravo
*   GrimAge version two
*   Dunedin Pace of Aging Methylation (POAM) - first iteration

### Non-Significant Associations with All-Cause Mortality:

The following four clocks were not significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk:
*   Skin Blood clock
*   John clock
*   Lynn
*   Wiedner

## Comparative Predictive Power for All-Cause Mortality

The Hazard Ratio (HR) indicates the risk of death for all causes associated with a relatively older epigenetic age for each clock.

| Epigenetic Clock          | Hazard Ratio (HR) | 95% Confidence Interval |
| :------------------------ | :---------------- | :---------------------- |
| GrimAge version two       | 1.51              | 1.33 - 1.70             |
| Dunedin Pace (POAM) v1    | 1.21              | 1.00 - 1.35             |
| Horvath                   | 1.11              | 0.97 - 1.27             |
| Hannum                    | 1.14              | 1.00 - 1.30             |
| PhenoAge                  | 1.12              | 0.99 - 1.27             |
| Vidal Bravo               | 1.10              | 0.97 - 1.25             |

**Analysis of Confidence Intervals:**
GrimAge version two's 95% confidence interval (1.33 to 1.7) did not overlap with the confidence intervals of Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, and Vidal Bravo, indicating a statistically significant difference in their predictive power for all-cause mortality. While close, the confidence intervals for GrimAge version two and Dunedin Pace (POAM) v1 had a slight overlap, suggesting GrimAge version two may still be a superior predictor.

**Conclusion:** Based on this analysis, GrimAge version two appears to be the most effective epigenetic clock for evaluating all-cause mortality risk among the clocks tested.

## GrimAge Biomarker Composition

GrimAge is an epigenetic predictor derived from the following components:

### Core Components:

*   Epigenetic estimation of Leptin
*   PAI-1
*   Adrenomedullin (ADM)
*   Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M)
*   GDF-15
*   Cystatin C
*   TEMP1

### Additional Predictors:

*   Sex
*   Smoking status
*   Chronological Age

**GrimAge Version Two additionally includes:**
*   hs-CRP
*   HbA1c

## Correlation of GrimAge Components with Overall GrimAge Score

The strength of correlation (Pearson's r) between individual variables and the overall GrimAge score was examined. Variables with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.7 are considered strongly correlated.

### Strongly Correlated Variables (r > 0.7):

*   **Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M):** Commercially available.
*   **Cystatin C:** Commercially available.
*   **GDF-15:** Availability may vary.
*   **TEMP1:** Availability may vary.
*   **hs-CRP:** Marker of inflammation, commercially available.
*   **HbA1c:** Marker of metabolic health, commercially available.

### Weaker Correlation (but still important contributors):

*   Leptin
*   PAI-1
*   Adrenomedullin (ADM)

**Note:** While some variables may have weaker direct correlations with the overall GrimAge score, they can still be important contributors to the epigenetic prediction. However, focusing on strongly correlated and commercially available biomarkers like B2M and Cystatin C, along with hs-CRP and HbA1c for GrimAge version two, may offer a cost-effective approach to approximating GrimAge assessment.

## Cost-Effective GrimAge Assessment

The direct GrimAge test costs $325. An alternative approach involves measuring key biomarkers that contribute significantly to the GrimAge score. Measuring B2M, Cystatin C, hs-CRP, and HbA1c costs approximately $146, representing a potential cost reduction of over 50%. This approach allows for tracking markers associated with inflammation and metabolic health, which are components of GrimAge.
