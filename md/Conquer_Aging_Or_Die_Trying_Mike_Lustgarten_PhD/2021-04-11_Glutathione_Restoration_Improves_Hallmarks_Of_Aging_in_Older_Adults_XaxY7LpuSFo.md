# 2021-04-11 Glutathione Restoration Improves Hallmarks Of Aging in Older Adults

**Executive Summary:**
*   Glutathione, the most abundant intracellular antioxidant, significantly declines with age in older adults.
*   Supplementation with high doses of glycine (0.1 g/kg/day) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 0.13 g/kg/day) effectively restores glutathione levels in older adults to those found in younger individuals.
*   This glutathione restoration leads to significant reductions in lipid and DNA oxidative damage, and key inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-alpha, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein).
*   Supplementation improves mitochondrial function, indicated by enhanced systemic and mitochondrial fat oxidation and reduced mitochondrial sugar oxidation.
*   Insulin sensitivity is also significantly improved, with reductions in fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR. These beneficial effects are lost upon cessation of supplementation.

## What is Glutathione?

Glutathione is a tripeptide composed of three amino acids: glutamate, cysteine, and glycine. It is the most abundant intracellular antioxidant, playing crucial roles in maintaining mitochondrial function, affecting gene expression, and influencing protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum.

Glutathione neutralizes reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), through the following process:

H2O2 + 2GSH (reduced glutathione) --(Glutathione Peroxidase)--> 2H2O + GSSG (oxidized glutathione)

Subsequently, oxidized glutathione (GSSG) can be reduced back to its active form (GSH) with the help of GSSG reductase and NADPH:

GSSG + NADPH --(GSSG Reductase)--> 2GSH + NADP+

## Glutathione Declines with Age

Studies consistently show a significant and steady decline in glutathione levels during aging. For example, older adults (60-75 years) exhibit substantially lower red blood cell glutathione levels compared to young adults (31-40 years). This age-related decline is attributed, in part, to lower circulating levels of glycine (55% lower) and cysteine (24% lower) in older adults, while glutamate levels remain unchanged.

## Short-Term Human Study: Glycine & NAC Supplementation

A two-week study investigated if restoring glycine and cysteine could increase glutathione levels in older adults.

**Study Protocol:**
*   **Participants:** Older adults
*   **Duration:** 2 weeks
*   **Supplementation:**
    *   Glycine: 0.1 grams per kilogram of body weight per day
    *   N-acetylcysteine (NAC, as a cysteine donor): 0.13 grams per kilogram of body weight per day
*   **Example Doses (for a 70 kg person):** 7 grams per day of glycine and 9.3 grams per day of NAC. These are amounts not typically obtained from a normal diet.

**Results:**
*   Glycine and cysteine levels in older adults were restored to relatively youthful levels.
*   Consequently, red blood cell glutathione levels in supplemented older adults were also restored to youthful levels.
*   The study also reported reduced lipid oxidative damage, though specific data was not detailed.

## Long-Term Human Study: 24-Week Glycine & NAC Supplementation

A subsequent 24-week study with the same supplementation protocol evaluated the sustained impact of glycine and NAC on various health parameters in older adults.

**Overall Findings:**
This long-term supplementation resulted in:
*   Reductions in lipid and DNA oxidative damage.
*   Reductions in inflammation.
*   Improvements in mitochondrial function.
*   Improvements in insulin sensitivity.
*   Improvements in physical and cognitive function (not detailed in this summary).
*   Improvements in endothelial and kidney function markers (not detailed in this summary).
*   Reduced triglycerides (not detailed in this summary).

### Impact on Glutathione Levels
*   **Baseline:** Older adults displayed significantly lower red blood cell glutathione levels (e.8 units) compared to young adults (1.8 units), representing more than a 50% difference.
*   **Supplementation Effect:** After 12 and 24 weeks of supplementation, glutathione levels in older adults increased significantly from 0.8 units at baseline to 1.0 units (12 weeks) and 1.6 units (24 weeks), nearly doubling baseline levels and approaching youthful concentrations.
*   **Cessation Effect:** Following the cessation of supplementation for 12 weeks after the 24-week period, glutathione levels reverted to baseline levels (0.9 units), indicating the direct impact of the supplements.

### Reduction in Oxidative Damage
*   **Baseline:** Older adults exhibited at least four-fold higher levels of both DNA oxidative damage (measured by 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine) and lipid oxidative damage (measured by plasma F2-isoprostanes) compared to younger adults.
*   **Supplementation Effect:** Glycine and NAC supplementation significantly reduced DNA oxidative damage from approximately 107 units at baseline to 60 units (12 weeks) and 40 units (24 weeks). Lipid oxidative damage decreased from 186 units at baseline to 64 units (12 weeks) and 48 units (24 weeks).
*   **Cessation Effect:** After stopping supplementation, both DNA and lipid oxidative damage levels increased, trending back towards baseline.

### Reduction in Inflammation
*   **Baseline:** Older adults had significantly elevated inflammatory markers compared to young adults:
    *   IL-6: >9-fold higher
    *   TNF-alpha: ~2-fold higher
    *   High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP): ~2-fold higher
*   **Supplementation Effect:** Supplementation led to marked reductions in inflammation:
    *   IL-6 decreased from 4.8 to 1.1 units (a 75% reduction).
    *   TNF-alpha decreased from 98 to 59 units (a ~30% reduction).
    *   hsCRP decreased from 4.9 to 3.2 units (a ~30% reduction).
*   **Cessation Effect:** Upon cessation of supplementation, inflammatory markers increased again (IL-6 from 1.1 to 2; TNF-alpha from 59 to 73; hsCRP from 3.2 to 3.9), confirming the role of the amino acids in reducing inflammation.

### Improvement in Metabolic Function
*   **Respiratory Quotient (RQ):** RQ, an index of systemic substrate oxidation (closer to 0.7 indicates greater fat oxidation), was higher in older adults (0.84) compared to young adults, suggesting less systemic fat oxidation. Supplementation reduced RQ values in older adults from 0.84 to 0.79 (12 weeks) and 0.77 (24 weeks), indicating improved systemic fat oxidation. These improvements reversed when supplementation ceased.
*   **Mitochondrial Fat Oxidation:** Mitochondrial fat oxidation was lower in older adults compared to young adults. Supplementation significantly improved mitochondrial fat oxidation at both 12 and 24 weeks.
*   **Mitochondrial Sugar Oxidation:** Conversely, mitochondrial sugar oxidation was higher in older adults than in young adults. Supplementation reduced mitochondrial sugar oxidation in older adults to levels similar to those found in younger adults.

### Improvement in Insulin Sensitivity
*   **Baseline:** Older adults displayed higher fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR (a measure of insulin resistance) compared to younger adults.
*   **Supplementation Effect:** Supplementation significantly improved these markers:
    *   Glucose decreased from 5.4 mmol/L to 4.9 mmol/L (after 24 weeks).
    *   Insulin levels were cut by more than half after 24 weeks.
    *   HOMA-IR was also reduced by more than half.
*   **Cessation Effect:** Upon discontinuation of supplementation, plasma glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR levels reverted back towards baseline, indicating that the improvements were directly due to the glycine and NAC.

## Conclusion: Improved Hallmarks of Aging

High-dose glycine and N-acetylcysteine supplementation in older adults effectively restored glutathione levels to those found in younger adults, leading to improvements in several hallmarks of aging:
*   **Genomic Instability:** Reduced DNA oxidative damage.
*   **Nutrient Sensing:** Improved insulin sensitivity.
*   **Mitochondrial Dysfunction:** Improved mitochondrial function (increased fat oxidation, decreased sugar oxidation).
*   **Inflammation:** Reduced systemic inflammation.
