# 2023-09-03 Did Tryptophan And Or Serine Mess Up Blood Biomarkers Blood Test 5 in 2023 Analysis

## Executive Summary

*   Blood test number five in 2023 showed a significantly worse biological age score (PhenoAge) compared to the average of the previous eight tests, representing an outlier in the data.
*   The period corresponding to blood test five involved significantly increased supplementation of tryptophan (2g/day, a 300% increase over baseline) and serine (5.7g/day, a 250% increase over baseline).
*   Dietary changes during this period were minor, with most food intake differences between test periods being less than 20% and not correlating with the magnitude of the supplement changes.
*   Vitamin and mineral intake also showed minor changes, with no statistically significant differences observed for most minerals, and changes in vitamins not deemed likely to be major contributing factors to the outlier blood test results.
*   The primary hypothesis for the outlier blood test result is the high supplemental intake of tryptophan and serine.

## Blood Test 5 Analysis (2023)

### Biological Age Outlier

*   Blood test number five in 2023 indicated a significantly worse biological age score using the PhenoAge calculator.
*   This score was approximately five years worse than the average of the previous eight tests.
*   It has been about 20 tests since a data point as poor as test number five was recorded, dating back to 2020.

### Supplementation during the Test Period (July 5 - August 20)

*   **Levothyroxine:** 137.5 micrograms/day (ongoing treatment for hypothyroidism).
*   **Vitamin D:** 1000 IU/day (supplemented for 19 out of 47 days corresponding to this test).
*   **Niacin and Tryptophan (First 19 days of the period):**
    *   Niacin: 828 mg/day.
    *   Tryptophan: 737 mg/day.
    *   Purpose: To potentially impact NAD levels. This combination did not further raise NAD relative to niacin alone.
*   **Tryptophan Alone (Subsequent 28 days before the test):**
    *   Tryptophan: 2 grams/day.
    *   No supplemental niacin.
    *   Baseline dietary tryptophan intake: ~1 gram/day (from 100g protein).
    *   Total Tryptophan Intake (with supplementation): ~3 grams/day.
    *   This represents a ~300% increase over baseline, considered a super-physiological dose.
*   **Serine and Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxal 5'-Phosphate, P5P) (47-day period):**
    *   Serine: 5.7 grams/day.
    *   Vitamin B6 (P5P): ~26 mg/day.
    *   Purpose: To potentially reduce homocysteine.
    *   Baseline dietary serine intake: 3.8 grams/day.
    *   Total Serine Intake (with supplementation): 9.5 grams/day.
    *   This represents a ~250% increase over baseline (2.5-fold increase).

### Dietary Intake Analysis (Test 5 vs. Test 4)

The period for Test 5 was 47 days, while the period for Test 4 was 72 days. Dietary intake was analyzed using Cronometer data.

*   **Top 25 Foods (Ranked by Grams, except Green Tea in ounces):** (List not provided in detail, but general trends are discussed).
*   **Key Dietary Differences (Statistically Significant or Notable):**
    *   **Watermelon:** Increased by 2 grams for Test 5 (1% difference), considered a minor change.
    *   **Almonds:** Increased by 3 grams for Test 5 (14% increase), with the goal to impact DHEA sulfate.
    *   **Flaxseed:** Increased for Test 5 to increase Alpha-Linolenic Acid (ALA) for PPAR-alpha activation, potentially impacting NAD. This resulted in a 21% higher intake.
    *   **Walnuts:** Reduced by 21% in Test 5, based on correlations with omega-6 intake and negative biomarker effects. This reduction was still 15 times lower in magnitude than the tryptophan increase.
    *   **Brazil Nuts:** A 0.1-gram difference (7.4g vs. 7.3g) was near statistical significance, considered a very minor dietary difference.
    *   **Jalapenos:** Included in Test 5 (~1 gram/day), not present in Test 4. A very minor dietary difference.
    *   **Grape Seed Powder:** Present only in Test 4 (attempt to impact NAD levels).
    *   **Peanut Butter:** Part of a cheat meal in Test 4, absent in Test 5.
    *   **Cashew Butter:** Included in two cheat meals in Test 5.
*   **Magnitude of Dietary Changes vs. Supplementation:** The dietary differences observed were at most around 20-30%, significantly smaller than the 250-300% increases seen with supplemental serine and tryptophan.
*   **Cheat Meals:** Two cheat meals in Test 5 involved cashew butter mixed with M&Ms or Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. The total calories from these additions were less than 1% of total calories for the 47-day period.

### Calorie and Macronutrient Intake

*   **Average Daily Calorie Intake:**
    *   Test 5: 2122 calories/day.
    *   Test 4: 2145 calories/day.
    *   Test 5 represents the lowest average daily calorie intake since April 2015.
*   **Top Calorie Contributors:** Sardines were the top contributor for both tests. Nine of the top 10 calorie-contributing foods were the same between Test 4 and Test 5.
*   **Protein Intake:**
    *   Test 5: ~101 grams/day (19% of total calories).
    *   Test 4: ~99 grams/day.
    *   Difference was not statistically significant (p=0.18).
    *   Top protein contributors: Sardines, collard greens, yogurt, serine, almonds, mushrooms, flaxseeds, beets, steel-cut oats, and carrots.
*   **Fat Intake:**
    *   Test 5: ~81 grams/day (34.5% of total calories).
    *   Test 4: ~80 grams/day (33.6% of total calories).
    *   Overall fat intake was not statistically different.
    *   **Monounsaturated Fat:** ~2 grams higher in Test 5 (11% difference), considered minor.
    *   **Omega-3:** Higher in Test 5 due to increased flaxseed intake (~11% difference, less than 1 gram increase), considered minor.
    *   **Omega-6:** Less by less than 1 gram (less than 5% difference), though significant.
    *   Polyunsaturated fats and saturated fats were not significantly different. Dietary cholesterol was not different.
*   **Carbohydrate Intake:**
    *   **Total Carbohydrates:**
        *   Test 5: 286 grams/day.
        *   Test 4: Not explicitly stated for Test 4, but Test 5 was significantly lower.
    *   **Fiber Intake:**
        *   Test 5: 83.5 grams/day.
        *   Test 4: Not explicitly stated, but Test 5 was close to significance (p=0.08), with a ~2 gram difference.
    *   **Net Carbohydrates (Total Carbs - Fiber):**
        *   Test 5: 203 grams/day.
        *   Test 4: ~212 grams/day.
        *   The 8-gram difference in net carbs for Test 5 was less than 5% and considered a minor dietary change.
    *   **Total Fructose Intake:**
        *   Test 5: 58.5 grams/day.
        *   Test 4: 58.1 grams/day.
        *   Not significantly different.

### Vitamin and Mineral Intake

*   **Vitamins:**
    *   **Niacin:** Significantly higher in Test 5, but this was due to supplementation in the first 19 days only. The speaker finds it unlikely to affect the test outcome significantly.
    *   **Vitamin B6 (P5P):** Significantly lower by about 10 mg in Test 5, but still well above baseline and previous higher levels, making it an unlikely contributor.
    *   **Vitamin D:** Significantly lower in Test 5, but offset by sun exposure.
    *   **Vitamin E:** A 0.5 mg increase in Test 5, a less than 3% difference, to boost DHEA sulfate. Considered a minor dietary difference.
*   **Minerals:**
    *   For all tracked minerals, the p-value for comparisons between Test 5 and Test 4 was greater than 0.05, indicating no significant differences in mineral intake.

### Conclusion and Future Plans

*   The minor dietary changes observed between test periods do not account for the significant outlier in blood test number five.
*   The high supplemental intake of tryptophan (300% increase) and serine (250% increase) are considered the most likely factors that negatively impacted blood biomarkers.
*   For the next blood test (scheduled for October):
    *   Tryptophan, serine, and vitamin B6 supplementation have been discontinued.
    *   Omega-3 (2 grams/day) has been added.
    *   Methyl B12 has been added as a means for reducing homocysteine.
*   The hypothesis is that if tryptophan and serine were the cause of the outlier, the next test results should show an improvement in biological age.
