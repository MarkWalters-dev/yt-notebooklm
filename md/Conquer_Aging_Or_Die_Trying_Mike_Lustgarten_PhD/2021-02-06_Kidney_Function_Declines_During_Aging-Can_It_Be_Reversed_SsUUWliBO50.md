# 2021-02-06 Kidney Function Declines During Aging-Can It Be Reversed

## Executive Summary
*   Kidney function, measured by estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), typically declines with age, starting around 125 in youth and decreasing to 50 or lower by age 90. An eGFR less than 45 is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality.
*   Age-related kidney function decline can be reversed through specific dietary changes. Personal data showed an average eGFR increase from 86 to 97 over an eight-year period, effectively improving kidney function to levels found in individuals approximately 15 years younger.
*   High daily total vegetable intake (up to 2,000 grams or 25 servings) and sardine intake were strongly correlated with higher eGFR, while higher beef intake correlated with lower eGFR.
*   A regression model indicated that the combined intake of sardines, total vegetables, and beef explained 70% of the variability in eGFR.
*   Higher dietary fiber and omega-3 fatty acid intake, alongside lower protein intake, correlated with higher eGFR. This suggests a mechanism where fiber is fermented by gut bacteria into short-chain fatty acids like butyrate, which in turn is associated with improved kidney function.

## Kidney Function Decline with Aging
Kidney function, indicated by estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), declines during aging. In youth (20-year-olds), average eGFR is about 125, decreasing to values around 50 in people 90 years old or older.

**eGFR Stages of Kidney Disease:**
*   **Good Kidney Function:** eGFR >= 90
*   **Stage 2 (Mild loss):** eGFR 60-89
*   **Stage 3 (Moderate to severe loss):** eGFR 30-59
*   **Stage 4 (Severe loss):** eGFR 15-29
*   **Stage 5 (Kidney failure):** eGFR 0-15 (requires treatment like hemodialysis)

## eGFR and Mortality Risk
An eGFR less than 45 is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. This finding is supported by a meta-analysis of 46 studies including over 2,000,000 subjects. Compared to subjects with eGFR values of 95, those with an eGFR less than 45 demonstrated a significantly increased risk of death for all causes.

## Personal Kidney Function Data & Reversal
Personal biomarker tracking over 15 years provides evidence of eGFR improvement.

### Tracking Methodology:
*   **2006-2013:** Circulating biomarkers tracked approximately once a year during doctor visits.
*   **Since 2015:** Circulating biomarkers measured up to six times a year.
*   **Since 2015:** All food was weighed, and macro/micronutrients were tracked daily.
*   **Since July 2018:** Actual food intakes were logged, accumulating 880 tracked food intakes corresponding to 13 eGFR measurements.

### eGFR Trend:
*   **2006-2013:** Over eight measurements in this seven-year period, the average eGFR was 86. For the subject's age during this period, the expected eGFR would have been around 90, suggesting kidneys were aging at an average rate.
*   **2015-2020:** The average eGFR increased to approximately 97. Based on the age-related decline curve, the expected eGFR for this period would have been around 78.
*   This increase is statistically significant (t-test, p < 0.05). The subject reversed the age-related decline in kidney function, improving it closer towards youth. Extrapolating from the curve, this eGFR value is typically found in someone about 15 years younger than the subject's chronological age.

## Dietary Factors Correlated with eGFR

### Vegetable Intake:
Average daily total vegetable intake demonstrated a strong positive correlation with eGFR, with a correlation coefficient of 0.79. This indicates that 63% of the variability in eGFR can be explained by the daily sum of vegetable intake. This correlation is statistically significant (p < 0.05). Vegetable intake reached up to 2,000 grams per day, corresponding to about 25 servings (using 80 grams as a standard serving size), including carrots, red bell peppers, broccoli, and cauliflower.

### Combined Food Group Analysis (Backward Elimination Regression Model):
To examine if other foods could explain more variability in kidney function, a backward elimination regression model was utilized.

**Input Variables:**
*   Dairy (yogurt, whey protein, cheese)
*   Nuts and Seeds (categorized by primary fatty acid: saturated [e.g., cocoa beans, coconut butter], monounsaturated [MUFA; e.g., almonds, pecans, peanuts], polyunsaturated-omega-3 [PUFA; e.g., flaxseed], polyunsaturated-omega-6 [PUFA; e.g., walnuts, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds])
*   Total vegetables
*   Fruit (total berry intake)
*   Sardines
*   Beef
*   Eggs

**Methodology for Backward Elimination Regression:**
1.  All 10 variables were initially entered into the regression model.
2.  Variables with the highest p-value (indicating weakest statistical significance) were sequentially removed one at a time.
3.  This iterative process continued until the best-performing regression model remained.

**Results:**
The combination of sardine intake, beef intake, and total vegetable intake was able to explain 70% of the adjusted R-squared variability in eGFR. Specifically, higher intake of sardines and vegetables, and a lower intake of beef, were correlated with a higher eGFR. This model was statistically significant (p < 0.05).

### Macronutrient and Fatty Acid Analysis:
Analysis across 28 blood tests revealed significant correlations between specific macronutrients and fatty acids with eGFR:
*   Higher intake of fiber was correlated with a higher eGFR.
*   Higher intake of omega-3 fatty acids was correlated with a higher eGFR.
*   Lower intake of protein was correlated with a higher eGFR.

These three components together explained 40% of the variability in eGFR.

## Mechanisms: Fiber and Butyrate
Fiber's impact on eGFR may be mediated by gut bacteria.
**Process Flow:**
Carbohydrates (escape absorption in small intestine) -> Large intestine -> Fermented by gut bacteria -> Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs: acetate, propionate, butyrate)

Butyrate, an SCFA, plays a crucial role. Higher levels of butyrate in stool samples correlate with higher eGFR. This suggests that a higher fiber intake leads to increased gut bacterial production of butyrate, which is then associated with better kidney function.
