# 2025-07-20 Reversing The Age-Related DHEA-S Decline - Cholesterol Gut Bacteria

## Executive Summary

*   DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S) levels decline with age, impacting various age-related outcomes including bone health, metabolism, immunity, and neuroprotection.
*   While DHEA-S is synthesized from cholesterol, personal data indicates that higher LDL cholesterol is significantly correlated with higher DHEA-S, but this may not be the primary mechanism driving age-related decline, as youthful individuals have low LDL and high DHEA-S.
*   DHEA is also a precursor to testosterone, and the observation of normal testosterone levels despite low DHEA-S suggests that DHEA synthesis from cholesterol is not the limiting factor in this individual's case.
*   Gut bacteria possess enzymes capable of degrading DHEA-S. Older individuals (97 vs. 67 years) show higher levels of these degrading bacterial genes and a significant reduction in plasma DHEA-S.
*   A gut-derived metabolite, indoxyl sulfate, is inversely correlated with DHEA-S levels in personal data, suggesting a potential role for gut microbiome activity in regulating DHEA-S.

## DHEA Sulfate Decline and Importance

DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S) exhibits an age-related decline. Average DHEA-S levels for men in their twenties are approximately 8 micromolar (300 micrograms/deciliter).

DHEA-S is important for:
*   Bone health (anti-osteoporotic)
*   Obesity management
*   Diabetes
*   Cancer prevention
*   Heart disease
*   Immune system function
*   Neuromodulation and neuroprotection

Personal DHEA-S levels are measured at an average of 125 micrograms/deciliter (3.4 micromolar), which is relatively low for chronological age and far from youthful levels.

## DHEA Synthesis from Cholesterol

DHEA-S is synthesized from cholesterol through a two-step enzymatic process:
1.  Cholesterol -> DHEA
2.  DHEA -> DHEA Sulfate

### Cholesterol Lipoprotein Correlations with DHEA Sulfate

Correlations between various cholesterol lipoproteins and DHEA-S were analyzed:
*   **HDL:** Not statistically significant (p = 0.12)
*   **VLDL:** Not statistically significant (p = 0.63)
*   **Lipoprotein A:** Not statistically significant (p = 0.28)
*   **LDL:** Significant positive correlation (r = 0.74). Higher LDL levels were associated with higher DHEA-S levels.

However, simply increasing LDL to boost DHEA-S could also increase ApoB and cardiovascular disease risk.

### Age-Related LDL and DHEA Sulfate Trends (Published Data)

Published data on LDL and DHEA-S across different age groups suggests a complex relationship:
*   **Youth (18 years):** Low LDL levels are associated with high DHEA-S levels.
*   **Midlife:** LDL levels peak, but DHEA-S levels are often lower than in youth.
*   **End of life:** LDL levels decline, and DHEA-S levels are at their lowest.

This pattern argues against simply raising LDL as a strategy to increase DHEA-S, as youthful high DHEA-S is seen with low LDL.

## DHEA as a Testosterone Precursor

DHEA is also a precursor for testosterone synthesis. If DHEA levels were low due to synthesis issues, testosterone levels would also be expected to be low.

*   In personal data, during periods when DHEA-S was age-expected (not youthful), testosterone levels were higher than expected for chronological age (around 900 ng/dL), suggesting that DHEA synthesis from cholesterol is not the limiting factor.

## Gut Bacteria and DHEA Sulfate Degradation

Gut bacteria possess genes that can degrade DHEA-S. One relevant enzyme class is EC 3.1.6 (sulfatases). A specific gene, k01138, can encode a sterile sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.2).

*   **Sterile Sulfatase Reaction:** DHEA Sulfate + Water -> DHEA + Sulfate
    *   This process hydrolyzes and degrades DHEA-S.

### Age-Related Gut Bacterial Gene Expression and DHEA-S Levels (Study Data)

A study comparing 67-year-olds and 97-year-olds found:
*   **Gut Bacterial Protein Levels:** 97-year-olds had three times higher levels of gut bacterial proteins capable of degrading DHEA-S compared to 67-year-olds.
*   **Plasma DHEA-S Levels:** 97-year-olds showed a 60% reduction in plasma DHEA-S compared to 67-year-olds.

This association suggests that increased gut bacterial degradation may contribute to DHEA-S decline during aging.

## Gut Bacterial Metabolites and DHEA Sulfate

### Indoxyl Sulfate Pathway

Indoxyl sulfate is a gut bacteria-derived metabolite:
1.  Undigested proteins reach the large intestine.
2.  Gut bacteria degrade these proteins into amino acids, including tryptophan.
3.  Gut bacteria convert tryptophan to indole.
4.  Indole travels via portal circulation to the liver.
5.  The liver sulfates indole to form indoxyl sulfate.

### Indoxyl Sulfate Correlation with DHEA Sulfate (Personal Data)

Personal metabolomic data (18 tests) and venipuncture data (DHEA-S) revealed a significant inverse correlation between indoxyl sulfate and DHEA-S:
*   Higher plasma indoxyl sulfate levels were significantly correlated with lower DHEA-S levels.
*   Lower plasma indoxyl sulfate levels were significantly correlated with higher DHEA-S levels.

The hypothesis is that decreasing indoxyl sulfate might increase DHEA-S.

## Diet and Indoxyl Sulfate

### Coconut Butter Correlation with Indoxyl Sulfate (Personal Data)

Personal diet tracking data (since 2015) was correlated with indoxyl sulfate levels:
*   **Coconut Butter Intake:** Inversely correlated with indoxyl sulfate.
    *   Low coconut butter intake (<3g/day) correlated with high indoxyl sulfate.
    *   Higher coconut butter intake (average 22g/day) correlated with low indoxyl sulfate.

This suggests that increasing coconut butter intake may help reduce indoxyl sulfate. Further data is being collected to test intakes of 25g/day and above.

### Direct Diet Correlations with DHEA Sulfate

Direct correlations between diet and DHEA-S showed fewer strong associations compared to the indoxyl sulfate pathway, suggesting that diet may influence DHEA-S indirectly through gut metabolites.

**Caution:** Coconut butter has a net negative correlative score with 27 standard clinical chemistry biomarkers at higher intakes, so extreme increases are not advised.

## Future Data and Research

The next set of personal data, including metabolomics and other blood biomarkers, is scheduled for July 22nd. This will provide further insights into the relationship between diet, indoxyl sulfate, and DHEA-S.
