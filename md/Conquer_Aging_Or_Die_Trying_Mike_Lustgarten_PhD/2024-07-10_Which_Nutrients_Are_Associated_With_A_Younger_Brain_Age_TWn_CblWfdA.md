# 2024-07-10 Which Nutrients Are Associated With A Younger Brain Age

## Executive Summary

*   A study investigated plasma nutrient biomarkers in relation to objectively measured brain age via MRI, differentiating between accelerated and delayed brain aging groups.
*   Key lifestyle factors such as METs, physical activity, resting heart rate, BMI, waist/hip circumference, sex, education, and income did not differ significantly between the accelerated and delayed brain aging groups.
*   Higher plasma levels of vaccenic acid, lignoceric acid, EPA, eicosadienoic acid, and choline were associated with a delayed brain aging phenotype.
*   These five identified nutrients can be potentially optimized through dietary intake, endogenous production, or by managing degradation processes.
*   Dietary sources for some of these nutrients include flax seeds, chia seeds, walnuts, peanuts, green leafy vegetables, almonds, sunflower seeds, red bell peppers, and pistachios.

## Study Design and Participants

*   The study analyzed plasma nutrient biomarkers for healthy brain aging.
*   **Plasma levels** were used, avoiding potential recall biases associated with questionnaire-based dietary assessments.
*   **Brain age** was an objective measure determined by MRI.
*   Participants: 100 individuals aged 65 to 75 years.
*   **Groups:**
    *   **Accelerated Brain Aging:** Average brain age older than chronological age (average brain age: 65.1 years).
    *   **Delayed Brain Aging:** Average brain age approximately five years younger than chronological age (average brain age: 59.7 years).
*   Even within the accelerated group, some individuals exhibited brain ages younger than their chronological age, but this was more prevalent in the delayed aging group, with some individuals showing brain ages up to 25 years younger.

## Comparison of Lifestyle and Demographic Factors

The following measures were assessed and found to **not** be significantly different between the accelerated and delayed brain aging groups:

*   **METs (Metabolic Equivalent of Task):** A measure of VO2 max.
*   **Physical Activity Levels.**
*   **Resting Heart Rate.**
*   **Body Mass Index (BMI).**
    *   Height.
    *   Weight.
*   **Waist and Hip Circumference:** Measures of abdominal adiposity.
*   **Sex Distribution.**
*   **Education Level.**
*   **Income Level.**

The lack of significant differences in these factors supports the hypothesis that plasma nutrient biomarkers are specifically associated with brain aging rather than general health or lifestyle differences.

## Nutrient Biomarkers Associated with Delayed Brain Aging

The following plasma metabolites were identified as being associated with the delayed brain aging phenotype:

*   **Vaccenic acid** (also known as octadecenoic acid)
*   **Lignoceric acid** (also known as eicosanoic acid)
*   **Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)** (a fish oil fatty acid)
*   **Eicosadienoic acid**
*   **Choline**

## Personal Metabolomic Data (Example)

The speaker shares personal tracking data for the five key nutrients using an at-home metabolomics kit.

*   **Methodology:**
    *   Sum of the plasma levels of the five identified nutrients is calculated for each test.
    *   An average is then calculated for each year based on available tests.
*   **2023 Average:** 258 micromolar.
*   **2024 Average (to date):** 456 micromolar.
*   **Observation:** A significant increase in the average level of these five nutrients from 2023 to 2024.

## Strategies to Increase Plasma Nutrient Levels

Increasing plasma nutrient levels can be influenced by three factors:

1.  **Dietary Intake:** Increasing consumption of nutrient-rich foods.
2.  **Endogenous Production:** The body's own synthesis of these nutrients.
3.  **Degradation:** Minimizing the breakdown of these nutrients (e.g., EPA and DHA can decline due to inflammation during aging).

### Dietary Recommendations for Specific Nutrients:

*   **Vaccenic Acid:** Found in grass-fed dairy and meat.
*   **Lignoceric Acid:** Found abundantly in peanuts.
*   **Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA):** Found in fatty fish.
*   **Eicosadienoic Acid:** No specific PubMed references found for dietary optimization.
*   **Choline:** Found in eggs, liver, and soybeans.

### Dietary Recommendations for Related Compounds (potentially influencing the identified nutrients):

*   **Alpha-Linolenic Acid (ALA):** Commonly found in flax seeds, chia seeds, and walnuts.
*   **Carotenoids (Lutein and Zeaxanthin):** Can be increased with green leafy vegetables (e.g., collard greens, lettuce, kale).
*   **Vitamin E Isomers:**
    *   **Alpha-tocopherol:** Found in almonds, sunflower seeds, and red bell peppers.
    *   **Gamma-tocopherol:** Abundant in pistachios and flax seeds.
