# 2021-01-14 Apigenin Increases Muscle Mass And Improves Muscle Function In Both Young And Old Mice

## Executive Summary

*   Apigenin supplementation significantly increased muscle mass in young mice, independent of diet composition (low-fat vs. high-fat).
*   Apigenin improved treadmill running distance in young mice, indicating enhanced muscle function.
*   In old mice, apigenin supplementation increased muscle weight to body weight ratio and significantly improved grip strength and treadmill running distance.
*   Apigenin supplementation reduced frailty scores in old mice, suggesting a broader impact on age-related decline.
*   Human equivalent doses for apigenin range from 288 mg to 1.2 grams per day, potentially achievable through dietary sources like parsley.

## Mouse Data

### Study 1: Young Mice (5 Weeks Old) on Low-Fat Diet

*   **Supplementation:** Apigenin at 0.04% and 0.2% compared to a normal diet.
*   **Duration:** 7 weeks.
*   **Diet:** Low-fat (5% calories from fat), 16% protein.

**Muscle Mass:**
*   Apigenin supplementation (both low and high doses) increased the weight of the quadriceps muscles compared to control mice.
*   No significant differences were observed in total body weight, heart weight, liver weight, or fat depot weight, suggesting a muscle-specific effect of apigenin.

**Muscle Function:**
*   Apigenin supplementation resulted in longer treadmill running distances to exhaustion compared to control mice.

**Human Equivalent Dose Calculation (Low Dose - 0.04%):**
*   **Daily Apigenin Consumption (mg):** 6 mg
*   **Dose per kg Body Weight (mg/kg):** 210 mg/kg
*   **Human Equivalent Dose (mg/day for a 71kg person):** 1.2 grams

### Study 2: Young Mice (22 Weeks Old) on High-Fat Diet

*   **Supplementation:** Apigenin at 0.1% compared to a normal diet and a high-fat diet alone.
*   **Duration:** 8 weeks.
*   **Diet:** High-fat (60% calories from fat), 20% protein.

**Muscle Cross-Sectional Area (Gastrocnemius Muscle):**
*   Mice on a high-fat diet showed smaller muscle cross-sectional areas (individual muscle fiber size) compared to the normal diet group.
*   Apigenin supplementation in mice on a high-fat diet led to a significant increase in muscle cross-sectional area.

**Muscle Function (Treadmill Running Distance):**
*   Mice on a high-fat diet ran significantly shorter distances to exhaustion compared to the normal diet group.
*   Apigenin supplementation in mice on a high-fat diet resulted in longer running distances.

**Human Equivalent Dose Calculation:**
*   **Mouse Weight at Study End:** 50 grams
*   **Human Equivalent Dose (mg/day for a 71kg person):** 346 mg

### Study 3: Old Mice (Approximately Middle Age)

*   **Ages:** Young (6-9 months), Old (16 months).
*   **Supplementation Doses:** 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg body weight of apigenin via intragastric administration.
*   **Limitations:** Only male mice were studied.

**Muscle Mass (Tibialis Anterior, EDL, Soleus):**
*   An age-related decline in muscle weight to body weight ratio was observed.
*   The two highest doses (50 and 100 mg/kg) of apigenin increased the muscle weight to body weight ratio in the tibialis anterior.
*   The middle dose (50 mg/kg) increased the muscle weight to body weight ratio in the EDL and soleus muscles.

**Muscle Function:**
*   **Grip Strength:** An age-related reduction in grip strength was observed. Apigenin supplementation at all tested doses (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) significantly improved grip strength in old mice.
*   **Treadmill Running Distance:** An age-related decline in running distance was observed. The two highest doses (50 and 100 mg/kg) of apigenin increased treadmill running distance.

**Frailty:**
*   Old mice exhibited higher frailty scores.
*   Apigenin supplementation at 50 and 100 mg/kg significantly reduced frailty scores.

**Human Equivalent Dose Calculation (using 50 mg/kg dose):**
*   **Human Equivalent Dose (mg/day for a 71kg person):** 288 mg

## Human Evidence & Dietary Considerations

*   **Dietary Sources of Apigenin:**
    *   **Dried Parsley:** >4500 mg/100g. Approximately 6.4 grams needed daily to reach 288 mg.
    *   **Fresh Parsley:** 215.5 mg/100g. Approximately 134 grams (5 ounces) needed daily to reach 288 mg.
    *   **Chamomile Tea:** Highly variable. One study reported 91 mg per 500 ml, requiring 1.6 liters. Other studies show significantly lower amounts (1-24 mg per 500 ml), making it an unreliable source for achieving the calculated dose.

*   **Current Status:** There are no active randomized controlled trials in humans evaluating the effect of apigenin supplementation on muscle in either young or older adults. The translation of mouse data to human outcomes is currently unknown.
