# 2021-10-10 Epidemiological Studies vs n=1 - What s Optimal For Dietary Cholesterol

## Executive Summary

*   Epidemiological studies on dietary cholesterol and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence or heart disease mortality yield conflicting results. Some studies show no significant association for moderate intakes, while others link intakes greater than 230-300 mg/day to an increased risk of incident CVD.
*   Data on all-cause mortality risk also presents contradictions: one study associated the lowest risk with 235 mg/day and increased risk with intakes below 184 mg/day, whereas another found no increased risk for intakes below 114 mg/day but an increased risk for intakes exceeding 300 mg/day.
*   An individual's (n=1) longitudinal data, tracked over 6.5 years, demonstrated that higher average daily dietary cholesterol intake significantly correlated with negative changes in six 'big picture biomarkers' (higher glucose, creatinine, BUN, neutrophils; lower lymphocyte percentage; higher LDL). It also correlated with positive changes in four biomarkers (lower AST, ALT; higher platelets, red blood cells).
*   Considering the net balance of these correlations (6 negative vs. 4 positive), the individual's data suggested that a dietary cholesterol intake slightly below their 6.5-year average of 143 mg/day, potentially around 100 mg/day, might be optimal for them.
*   Correlations between LDL levels and the same 'big picture biomarkers' for this individual also showed a net negative pattern (5 negative vs. 4 positive), supporting the idea that a relatively lower LDL, and consequently lower dietary cholesterol, might be more beneficial.

## Epidemiological Studies on Dietary Cholesterol Intake

### Heart Disease and CVD Mortality Risk

*   **Study 1 (approx. 37,000 people, average age 50, 8-year follow-up):** Heart disease mortality risk was plotted against dietary cholesterol intake. When compared with a referent intake defined as below 200 mg/day, relatively higher and relatively lower values of dietary cholesterol were not statistically associated with heart disease mortality risk.
*   **Study 2 (approx. 30,000 subjects, average age 52, 18-year follow-up):** This study investigated the incidence of CVD (fatal and non-fatal coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular deaths).
    *   **Methodology:** Data was divided into five quintiles of daily cholesterol intake:
        *   Quintile 1: 0-114 mg/day
        *   Quintile 2: 114-174 mg/day
        *   Quintile 3: 175-229 mg/day
        *   Quintile 4: 230-300 mg/day
        *   Quintile 5: >300 mg/day
    *   **Findings:**
        *   Compared to the referent (low cholesterol intake, <114 mg/day), Quintile 2 (114-174 mg/day) and Quintile 3 (175-229 mg/day) intakes were not significantly different in terms of CVD incidence.
        *   In contrast, Quintile 4 (>230 mg/day) and Quintile 5 (>300 mg/day) were associated with a statistically significant higher risk for incident CVD.
*   **Summary of Contradictory Findings:** One study suggested no significant association between dietary cholesterol and heart disease mortality risk, while the other linked dietary cholesterol intakes above 230 mg/day to a higher risk for incident CVD.

### All-Cause Mortality Risk

*   **Study 1 (implied "SEIA study" from context):** All-cause mortality risk was plotted against dietary cholesterol intake.
    *   **Findings:**
        *   A dietary cholesterol intake of 235 mg/day was associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk.
        *   Dietary cholesterol intakes less than 184 mg/day were associated with a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk.
        *   Dietary cholesterol intakes higher than 235 mg/day were not significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Study 2 (the "Zhang study"):** This study also investigated all-cause mortality risk using five quintiles of dietary cholesterol intake.
    *   **Methodology:** The analysis included a least adjusted model (Model 1), a model with more adjusted variables (Model 2), and a fully adjusted model (Model 3).
    *   **Findings:**
        *   Compared to the referent (0-114 mg/day), relatively low intakes were not associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.
        *   For intakes between 230-300 mg/day, Model 1 showed a significant association with increased all-cause mortality risk, but this statistical significance was lost in Models 2 and 3 when further variables were adjusted for.
        *   For intakes between 301-453 mg/day (Quintile 5), dietary cholesterol was associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk across all models (Model 1, 2, and 3).
*   **Summary of Contradictory Findings for All-Cause Mortality:**
    *   Study 1 suggested increased risk for <184 mg/day and no increased risk for >235 mg/day.
    *   Study 2 indicated no increased risk for <114 mg/day but a significant increased risk for >300 mg/day.

## Individual (n=1) Data Analysis

To evaluate optimal dietary cholesterol intake given conflicting epidemiological data, an individual's long-term tracking data was analyzed for correlations with 'big picture biomarkers'.

### Dietary Tracking Methodology

*   Daily diet has been tracked since 2015.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  All food is weighed daily using a food scale.
    2.  Food amounts are entered into nutrition tracking software (e.g., Cronometer).
    3.  Output data (including macronutrients and individual food amounts) is manually entered into a spreadsheet daily (approx. 5 minutes/day).
*   The average dietary intake for the period between blood tests (e.g., 59 days between day 1 and day 60) corresponds to the blood test results on day 60.
*   This approach, with enough blood tests and corresponding dietary data, allows for correlation analysis between diet and blood test variables to identify optimal intakes.

### Average Daily Cholesterol Intake

*   Data tracked from April 2015 to October 2021, encompassing 32 blood tests over 6.5 years.
*   The individual's average daily dietary cholesterol intake during this period was 143 mg/day.
*   The range of dietary cholesterol intake was sufficiently wide to evaluate effects of varying amounts on biomarkers.

### 'Big Picture Biomarkers' Monitored

A total of 23 biomarkers are regularly tracked, with blood tests conducted six or more times a year. These biomarkers assess multiple organ systems and include:

*   Glucose (marker of insulin resistance/sensitivity)
*   Homocysteine
*   Three markers of kidney function: creatinine, uric acid, and BUN (blood urea nitrogen)
*   Four markers of liver function (e.g., AST, ALT)
*   Lipoproteins (e.g., LDL, Lipoprotein (a))
*   Immune cells (e.g., neutrophils, lymphocyte percentage)
*   Red blood cell-related markers
*   Inflammation (including high sensitivity C-reactive protein)
*   Overall biological age score (computed by Levine's PhenoAge and aging.ai)

*Note: With the exception of homocysteine, lipoprotein (a), and C-reactive protein, these biomarkers are found on a standard chemistry panel plus CBC, a relatively affordable test (less than $35).*

### Correlations for Average Daily Dietary Cholesterol Intake with 'Big Picture Biomarkers'

Higher average daily dietary cholesterol intake significantly correlated with:

*   **Biomarkers trending in an unfavorable direction (6):**
    *   Higher glucose
    *   Higher creatinine
    *   Higher BUN
    *   Higher neutrophils (which increase during aging)
    *   Lower percentage of lymphocytes (which decline during aging)
    *   Higher LDL (a significant positive correlation)
*   **Biomarkers trending in a favorable direction (4):**
    *   Lower AST
    *   Lower ALT
    *   Higher platelets (which decrease during aging)
    *   Higher red blood cells (which decline during aging)

*   **Net Score:** 6 unfavorable correlations vs. 4 favorable correlations, resulting in a net score of -2. This suggests that a dietary cholesterol intake slightly below the individual's 6.5-year average may be optimal.

### LDL Correlations and Overall Interpretation

For this individual, a higher LDL was significantly correlated with:

*   **Biomarkers trending in an unfavorable direction (5):**
    *   Higher glucose
    *   Higher creatinine
    *   Higher BUN
    *   Higher neutrophils
    *   Lower lymphocyte percentage
*   **Biomarkers trending in a favorable direction (4):**
    *   Lower homocysteine
    *   Lower AST
    *   Lower ALT
    *   Higher red blood cells

*   **Net Score:** 5 unfavorable correlations vs. 4 favorable correlations, resulting in a net score of -1. This pattern is similar to the dietary cholesterol correlations and suggests that a relatively lower LDL, and correspondingly lower dietary cholesterol, might be optimal for this individual.

**Conclusion for Individual's Optimal Intake:**
Considering the net score of -2 for dietary cholesterol's correlation with the 'big picture biomarkers', and an average intake of 143 mg/day, the data suggests that for this individual, an optimal dietary cholesterol intake may be a bit below their six-and-a-half-year average, potentially around 100 mg/day. This will be re-evaluated with more data over time.
