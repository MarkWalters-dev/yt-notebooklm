# 2023-11-29 Longevity-Associated Triglycerides

## Executive Summary

*   Elevated total triglyceride levels (>1.69 mM or 150 mg/dL, or >80 mg/dL for coronary heart disease) are consistently associated with increased all-cause and coronary heart disease mortality risk across large populations.
*   Triglycerides are a heterogeneous group; specific triglyceride species, rather than just total levels, are associated with increased human longevity.
*   Key longevity-associated triglycerides include C56:8, C54:9, C56:6, C56:7, and C56:9, which are statistically linked to an increased probability of reaching 85 years of age.
*   These longevity-associated "groupings" (e.g., C56:6) represent multiple distinct triglyceride metabolites, indicating complexity beyond simple carbon and double bond counts.
*   An optimization strategy involves maintaining relatively high levels of these specific longevity-associated triglycerides while keeping overall total triglyceride levels low.

## Triglycerides and Mortality Risk

Higher circulating levels of triglycerides are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.

*   **Study 1 (Meta-analysis):**
    *   Included 14 studies, over 330,000 people, average age 48 years.
    *   When triglycerides exceeded 1.69 millimolar (mM) or 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), all-cause mortality risk significantly increased.
*   **Study 2:**
    *   Included over 1,500,000 people, average age 57 years.
    *   For triglyceride levels less than 1.7 mM (or 150 mg/dL), designated as the referent, all values above this threshold were significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk. The 95% confidence intervals for each quintile above this threshold were entirely above one, indicating statistical significance.
*   **Study 3:**
    *   Included almost 4,500,000 people.
    *   In the fully adjusted model, coronary heart disease mortality risk significantly increased once triglycerides rose above 80 mg/dL.

These studies consistently indicate that relatively higher total triglyceride levels are associated with increased coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality risk.

## Triglyceride Heterogeneity and Longevity

Triglycerides are not a homogeneous group of metabolites. While total high triglycerides are generally associated with negative health outcomes, individual triglyceride species can be associated with an increased odds of living to 85 years.

A plot of longevity (odds of reaching 85 years) against all-cause mortality risk showed that metabolites in the upper-left quadrant (increased probability of reaching 85 years and low all-cause mortality risk) included the amino acid serine and at least one specific triglyceride, C56:8 TAG.

## Specific Longevity-Associated Triglycerides

Several specific triglyceride species are associated with an increased probability of reaching 85 years:

*   **C56:8 TAG** (56 carbons, 8 double bonds)
*   **C54:9** (54 carbons, 9 double bonds)
*   **C56:6** (56 carbons, 6 double bonds)
*   **C56:7** (56 carbons, 7 double bonds)
*   **C56:9** (56 carbons, 9 double bonds)

Each of these five specific triglycerides is significantly associated with an increased odds of reaching 85 years. Their 95% confidence intervals are completely above one, and their p-values and false discovery rates (FDR) are each less than 0.05, confirming their statistical significance.

## Triglyceride Structure and Grouping

A triglyceride molecule includes three fatty acids bound to a glycerol backbone. The carbon and double bond count in a triglyceride species is the sum of its constituent fatty acids.

**Example of Triglyceride Structure Summation:**
3 Fatty Acids (each C12:1) -> Glycerol Backbone -> C36:3 Triglyceride (3 * 12 carbons, 3 * 1 double bond)

It's important to note that a given carbon and double bond count for a triglyceride (e.g., C56:6) can represent multiple distinct triglyceride species. For instance, the "C56:6 triglyceride" grouping encompasses eight different metabolites.

**Examples of distinct species under the C56:6 grouping:**
*   One fatty acid is C22:4 (22 carbons, 4 double bonds) **+** Two other fatty acids with a combined 34 carbons and 2 double bonds.
*   One fatty acid is C16:0 (saturated, 16 carbons, 0 double bonds) **+** Two other fatty acids with a combined 40 carbons and 6 double bonds.

Similar multiple distinct metabolites exist for C56:7 and C56:9. This indicates that while five specific triglyceride groupings are noted for longevity, these groupings represent 29 distinct, trackable triglyceride species.

## Optimization Strategy

Considering that these specific triglycerides are significantly associated with an increased probability of reaching 85 years, a potential strategy is to maintain relatively high levels of these specific longevity-associated triglycerides (C54:9, C56:6, C56:7, C56:8, C56:9) while keeping overall total triglyceride levels low. Research is ongoing to determine how diet influences the levels of these specific triglyceride species.
