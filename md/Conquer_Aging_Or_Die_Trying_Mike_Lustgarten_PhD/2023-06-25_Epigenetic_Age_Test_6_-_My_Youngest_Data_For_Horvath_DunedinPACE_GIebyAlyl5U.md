# 2023-06-25 Epigenetic Age Test 6 - My Youngest Data For Horvath DunedinPACE

## Executive Summary

*   My Horvath epigenetic age in April 2023 was 50.78 years, 0.55 years older than my chronological age, marking my lowest recorded Horvath age over six tests.
*   A significant positive correlation was observed between higher average daily body weight and an older Horvath epigenetic age.
*   Parsley and tomato intake showed a significant negative correlation with Horvath epigenetic age, suggesting higher intake correlated with a younger age.
*   The Dunedin PACE clock uniquely identified a slower epigenetic aging rate in individuals on a 12% calorie-restricted diet over two years, unlike other clocks (Horvath, Hannum, Levin's PhenoAge, GrimAge).
*   My Dunedin PACE value in April 2023 was 0.76, indicating 0.76 years of epigenetic aging per chronological year. My 2023 average (0.777) showed a trend towards a slower rate compared to 2022 (0.837), with a p-value of 0.052.

## Introduction to Epigenetic Clocks

The Horvath clock is considered robust for predicting chronological age due to its strong correlation. In contrast, Dunedin PACE is a promising epigenetic clock for evaluating the epigenetic rate of aging. To assess these metrics, blood samples were sent to True Diagnostic.

## Horvath Clock Data

### Why Horvath is Best for Chronological Age

DNA methylation age (Horvath clock) showed a significant and strong correlation with chronological age (birth to 100 years). This correlation was 0.94, which is very close to a perfectly linear correlation of 1. The Horvath clock is also known as Intrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration (IEEAA) or "intrinsic age" by True Diagnostic.

### My Horvath Age (April 2023)

For test number six in April 2023, my intrinsic Horvath age was 50.78 years. This is 0.55 years older than my chronological age. However, this represents my lowest Horvath epigenetic age recorded over six tests.

### Correlations with Horvath Age

#### Body Weight

Horvath Epigenetic Age was plotted against average daily body weight (in pounds) over six data points from 2022-2023. The average daily body weight was calculated for the period between tests, not just the test day. A significant positive correlation was observed: a relatively higher body weight correlated with an older Horvath epigenetic age. My body composition at 151 pounds was 12% body fat, and at 145 pounds, it is projected to be around 9% body fat, with further room for fat reduction to test this correlation.

#### Foods

Only two foods were significantly correlated with a younger Horvath epigenetic age: parsley and tomato.

*   **Parsley:** Correlation coefficient (r) was negative (-0.71), indicating a relatively higher intake was correlated with a younger Horvath age. The p-value was <0.05. My intake for the last test (51g/day) was at the high end of my range.
*   **Tomato:** Correlation coefficient (r) was negative (-0.75), indicating a relatively higher intake was correlated with a younger Horvath age. The p-value was <0.05. My intake for the last test (118g/day) was at the high end of my range.

*Note: These correlations did not account for the false discovery rate (FDR). Further testing by altering intake and observing changes in Horvath age would help assess causation.*

## Dunedin PACE Data

### Why Dunedin PACE? (Calorie Restriction Study)

Dunedin PACE may be the best epigenetic clock for evaluating the epigenetic aging rate. A study compared the change in various epigenetic clocks in individuals on an ad libitum (AL) diet versus a 12% calorie-restricted (CR) diet sustained over two years.

**Study Methodology:**
*   **Intervention:** 12% Calorie Restriction (CR) vs. Ad Libitum (AL) diet.
*   **Duration:** 2 years.
*   **Time Points:** Baseline, 12 months, 24 months.

**Results:**
*   Horvath and Hannum clocks did not identify a significant reduction in epigenetic aging in the CR group compared to AL.
*   Levin's PhenoAge and GrimAge also failed to detect a significant reduction in epigenetic aging for people on CR.
*   Dunedin PACE was the only epigenetic clock among the five tested that identified a slower epigenetic pace of aging for individuals on CR at both the 12-month and 24-month time points.

*Note: This was a single head-to-head study, and further research is needed to confirm if Dunedin PACE consistently outperforms other clocks in detecting intervention-induced aging rate changes.*

### My Dunedin PACE (April 2023)

My Dunedin PACE value for the April 24 test was 0.76.
*   **Interpretation:** A value of 0.6 represents the slowest epigenetic aging rate (0.6 years of epigenetic aging per 1 year of chronological age), while 1.4 is the fastest (1.4 years of epigenetic aging per 1 year of chronological age). My value of 0.76 indicates 0.76 years of epigenetic aging for every one year of chronological aging. This can be conceptualized as a standard aging rate for approximately 8.5 months of the year, with no epigenetic aging for the remaining 3.5 months.

### Dunedin PACE Trends and Ranking

*   **Previous Tests:**
    *   Average Dunedin PACE for three tests in 2022: 0.837.
    *   Average Dunedin PACE for three tests in 2023: 0.777.
*   **Statistical Significance:** A two-sample t-test showed the difference between the 2022 and 2023 averages was at the border of statistical significance (p=0.052).
*   **Rejuvenation Olympics:** My current average of 0.777 would tie me for ninth place in the "Rejuvenation Olympics" (based on the May update), moving up from previous rankings of 21st and 20th.

### Correlations with Dunedin PACE

#### Foods Correlated with a Slower Dunedin PACE

Two foods were significantly correlated with a slower (lower) Dunedin PACE: cinnamon and salt. The correlation coefficients were negative, meaning a higher intake was associated with a slower aging pace (p<0.05).
*   **Cinnamon:** My intake for the last test (51g/day) was at the high end of my range.
*   **Salt:** My intake for the last test (14g/day) was at the high end of my range.

#### Foods Correlated with a Faster Dunedin PACE

Coconut butter and dates were significantly correlated with a faster (higher) Dunedin PACE. The correlation coefficients were positive, meaning a higher intake was associated with a faster aging pace (p<0.05).
*   **Coconut Butter:** My intake for the last test (10g/day) was at the low end of my range.
*   **Dates:** My intake for the last test (22g/day) was higher than desired based on the correlation, suggesting a need for further reduction.

#### Body Weight and Calorie Intake

In contrast to the calorie restriction study, after six tests, my personal data showed that body weight and calorie intake were not significantly correlated with Dunedin PACE (p > 0.05). While current correlations were positive (higher body weight/calorie intake associated with faster Dunedin PACE), they lacked statistical significance.

## Future Plans

The next epigenetic age test (number seven) is scheduled for July 2023 to further monitor these trends and correlations.
