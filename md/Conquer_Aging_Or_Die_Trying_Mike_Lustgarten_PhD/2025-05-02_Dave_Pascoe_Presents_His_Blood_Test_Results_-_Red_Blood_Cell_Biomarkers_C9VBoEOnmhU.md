# 2025-05-02 Dave Pascoe Presents His Blood Test Results - Red Blood Cell Biomarkers

## Executive Summary

*   Recent blood tests show a significant increase in serum iron levels, potentially linked to the adoption of a protocol involving consuming fresh greens.
*   Red blood cell (RBC) count has been maintained at a level that resists the typical age-related decline, showing positive movement against the aging trend.
*   Hemoglobin levels are also moving in a favorable direction, resisting age-related decline, though recent values are noted as being above the optimal range associated with lower all-cause mortality risk.
*   Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), a measure of red blood cell size, is increasing with age, with current levels remaining within a generally acceptable range, though a lower MCV is typically associated with youth.
*   High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels have significantly increased, with a notable inverse correlation observed between HDL and lymphocyte counts, suggesting a complex interplay with the dietary changes, specifically collard greens.

## Red Blood Cell Biomarkers and Iron Metabolism

### Iron and Related Biomarkers

*   Serum iron levels have shown a substantial new peak in the latest blood test compared to previous results.
*   **Ferritin:** While serum iron is monitored, ferritin levels are considered a more informative indicator of iron status.
*   **Intervention:** A protocol involving the consumption of fresh greens (mustard and turnip greens) was implemented between the last two blood tests. This involved blending greens with a banana and consuming them daily, replacing processed greens powders.
*   **Hypothesis:** The increased iron levels are hypothesized to be a result of the increased intake of iron from these fresh greens.
*   **Relationship to Hemoglobin:** The high serum iron levels raise the question of whether hemoglobin and red blood cell counts would correspondingly increase or remain suboptimal.

### Red Blood Cell (RBC) Count

*   **Age-Related Trend:** Red blood cell counts typically decline during aging.
*   **Current Status:** The recent data indicates that RBC count has resisted this age-related decline, showing positive movement in the desired direction.
*   **Risk of High RBC Count:** Elevated RBC counts can be associated with increased all-cause mortality risk, particularly when hemoglobin exceeds 16 grams per deciliter.

### Hemoglobin

*   **Age-Related Trend:** Hemoglobin levels also tend to decline with aging, similar to RBC counts.
*   **Current Status:** Hemoglobin levels are trending in the right direction, resisting the age-related decline.
*   **Optimal Range:** Recent hemoglobin values are noted as being above the optimal range (below 16 grams per deciliter) associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality.
*   **Dehydration Consideration:** If dehydration were a factor, other blood components like glucose, BUN, and uric acid would also be expected to be elevated due to reduced blood volume.

### Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)

*   **Age-Related Trend:** MCV generally increases during aging.
*   **Current Status:** MCV has shown a "roller coaster effect" but has an upward trend line. Current values are around 90, which is considered acceptable, as centenarians can have very high MCV values.
*   **Youth Association:** Lower MCV values are more commonly found in youth, suggesting that an MCV around 84-85 might be more indicative of younger red blood cell characteristics.

### Hematocrit

*   Hematocrit is moving in the right direction, indicating a favorable trend.

## Other Biomarkers and Dietary Interplay

### High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) Cholesterol

*   **Significant Increase:** HDL cholesterol levels have shown a substantial increase, rising from as low as 28 to 67.
*   **Collard Greens Correlation:** Collard greens are identified as a food strongly correlated with this HDL increase.
*   **Inverse Association with Lymphocytes:** Published data shows an inverse association between HDL and lymphocytes.
*   **Personal Data Correlation:** Personal data plotting HDL versus lymphocytes confirms this inverse relationship.
*   **Optimal HDL for Lymphocytes:** The optimal HDL level for achieving lymphocyte counts closer to 2,000 is not 67.
*   **Dietary Adjustment:** A 25% reduction in collard green intake (from 16 ounces to 12 ounces) was implemented to observe if HDL levels decrease. This suggests a nuanced understanding of "optimal" levels based on individual metabolic responses.

## Potential Protocol Discussion

*   **Greens Consumption:** The protocol for consuming greens involves daily intake of fresh greens, such as mustard and turnip greens, blended into smoothies or consumed with meals.
*   **Quantity:** While greens are recognized as beneficial ("all-star"), the optimal quantity is a key consideration. Consuming approximately one pound of greens per day may be excessive, with a potential reduction to 12 ounces being tested.

## Unresolved Questions

*   The precise optimal amount of greens for health benefits without adverse effects on certain biomarkers (e.g., HDL) needs further investigation.
*   The long-term implications of consistently high hemoglobin values above the optimal range remain a point of observation.
