# 2025-10-26 Reducing Cardiovascular Disease Risk - Going Beyond ApoB

**Executive Summary**
*   PhenoAge, a biological age calculator, predicts cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality risk, with a one-year increase associated with a 10% higher risk of CVD-related death.
*   Optimal ranges for key lipids include HDL 50-69 mg/dL and apoA1 150-180 mg/dL. An HDL target of ≥67 mg/dL is identified to achieve optimal levels for both.
*   ApoB levels are important, but the composition of apoB-containing lipoproteins is critical: Lipoprotein(a) and VLDL are significantly more atherogenic than LDL. The goal is low apoB, low Lipoprotein(a), and low VLDL.
*   Low HSCRP levels (<2 mg/L) may mitigate Lipoprotein(a)-associated CVD risk.
*   Dietary modifications, including reduced net carbohydrate intake and increased total fat (especially monounsaturated fatty acids), are explored as strategies to lower Lipoprotein(a) and improve lipid profiles.

## PhenoAge and CVD Risk

The biological age calculated by Dr. Morgan Levine's PhenoAge clock was 35.4 years, approximately 17 years younger than chronological age. Although PhenoAge does not incorporate CVD-related biomarkers, a one-year increase in PhenoAge is significantly associated with a 10% higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease-related outcomes. This suggests PhenoAge is a decent indicator for evaluating CVD mortality risk.

## Lipid Panel Markers

### HDL and ApoA1

The reference range for HDL cholesterol considers anything higher than 40 mg/dL as good. However, based on published literature concerning HDL changes during aging and its association with all-cause mortality risk, an optimal range for HDL is identified as 50-69 mg/dL.

*   **Current HDL:** 60 mg/dL, which is within the optimal range.
*   **Historical HDL:** HDL has been ≥50 mg/dL for 19 consecutive tests (over approximately three years), with an average of 58 mg/dL. This represents an improvement from the previous 44 tests (over 10 years), which averaged 45 mg/dL.

ApoA1 may be a better predictor of CVD or heart disease-related mortality risk than HDL. The lab's target for apoA1 is >115 mg/dL. Based on literature, an optimal range for apoA1 is 150-180 mg/dL, considering its changes during aging and associations with all-cause mortality risk in large studies.

*   **Correlation between ApoA1 and HDL:** Personal data from seven tests (2024-2025) shows a strong positive correlation between apoA1 and HDL, with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.95. A correlation of 1.0 is perfectly linear, indicating a very strong, almost linear relationship.
*   **Combined Optimal Target:** To achieve optimal levels for both apoA1 (≥150 mg/dL) and HDL, an extrapolated target HDL level of 67-69 mg/dL is identified. The target for the next test is an HDL of 67 mg/dL.

### ApoB and Lipoprotein Composition

ApoB-containing lipoproteins include VLDL, Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], LDL, and IDL. IDL is a minor component and typically not reported. All these lipoproteins contain the apoB 100 protein.

**ApoB Levels**
The reference range for apoB is less than 90 mg/dL, with less than 80 mg/dL considered optimal under certain conditions. Literature suggests that an apoB level of less than 70 mg/dL is optimal, as it is associated with the lowest cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality risk in the general population.

*   **Current ApoB:** 59 mg/dL, which is within the optimal range.
*   **Method of Reduction:** This apoB level is achieved through diet, exercise, and leanness, not statin medication.

**Atherogenicity of ApoB-Containing Lipoproteins**
Even when total apoB is low, the composition of the apoB-containing lipoproteins is crucial because VLDL and Lipoprotein(a) are more atherogenic than LDL.

*   Data shows that when apoB is found in Lipoprotein(a), it is associated with a six-fold higher Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) risk compared to when apoB is found in LDL. This means, per lipoprotein particle, Lipoprotein(a) is six times more atherogenic than LDL.
*   VLDL particles are also more atherogenic than LDL particles. While LDL is often more abundant, this does not change the fact that VLDL is more atherogenic per particle.

Therefore, the goal is not just low apoB, but specifically low apoB combined with low Lipoprotein(a) and low VLDL.

#### Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a))

*   **Current Lp(a):** 81 nanomolar, which is outside the laboratory's reference range.
*   **Historical Lp(a):** Over 35 tests spanning 10 years, Lp(a) levels have consistently been at or above the reference range, with values as high as 145 nanomolar and as low as 70 nanomolar. While Lipoprotein(a) is often considered resistant to reduction, these fluctuations suggest some malleability.

**High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (HSCRP) and Lp(a)**
Lipoprotein(a)-associated CVD incident risk is significantly higher when HSCRP levels are greater than 2 mg/L.

*   **Current HSCRP:** 0.2 mg/L, which is 10 times lower than the identified cutoff.
*   **Historical HSCRP:** HSCRP has been less than 0.3 mg/L for 27 consecutive tests, and less than 0.2 mg/L for 10 consecutive tests, indicating persistently low inflammatory markers.

#### Triglycerides and VLDL

The reference range for triglycerides considers anything less than 150 mg/dL as acceptable. Optimal triglycerides, based on a study of approximately 5 million people, are less than 45 mg/dL, as this was associated with the lowest risk of death from coronary heart disease.

*   **VLDL Calculation:** VLDL is approximated by dividing triglycerides by five (Triglycerides / 5 = VLDL). Thus, an optimal VLDL would be around 9 mg/dL.
*   **Current Triglycerides:** 78 mg/dL, which is above the optimal target.
*   **Historical Triglycerides:** Over 63 tests (10 years), average triglycerides are 60 mg/dL. More recently (21 tests over three years), triglycerides have increased to an average of 65 mg/dL, aligning with the general trend of triglycerides increasing with aging. Maintaining triglycerides below 45 mg/dL (VLDL below 9 mg/dL) is hypothesized to result in the slowest rate of atherosclerotic progression.

#### LDL

The reference range recommends LDL levels less than 100 mg/dL, or even lower. However, a study of approximately 5 million people indicated that the lowest CHD mortality risk was associated with LDL in the 65-120 mg/dL range. LDL levels less than 65 mg/dL were significantly associated with a small, but significant, increase in CHD mortality risk.

*   **Current LDL:** 57 mg/dL, which is slightly below the optimal range.

**Refined Goal for Lipoprotein Profile:**
The objective is to keep apoB low (target 60 mg/dL) while optimizing the composition of lipoproteins. This involves reducing triglycerides (e.g., to 50-60 mg/dL) and Lipoprotein(a) (e.g., to 65 nanomolar), which, to keep total apoB low, would imply a higher LDL (e.g., to 85 mg/dL). This is considered a better overall profile than having very low LDL when other atherogenic lipoproteins are high.

## Strategies for Improvement: Dietary Correlations

Correlations between dietary intake and biomarkers are used to guide interventions aimed at improving biomarkers towards youth and lowest risk of all-cause mortality.

### Dietary Data Collection Protocol

*   Since 2015, approximately 99% of food intake has been weighed using a food scale.
*   Dietary data is entered into a diet tracking application.
*   This data is then extracted into a spreadsheet.
*   For each blood test, the average daily dietary intake for the period preceding the test is calculated and correlated with the blood test results. This method allows for the analysis of correlations once sufficient data (e.g., 35 tests for Lipoprotein(a)) has been collected.

### Net Carbs and Lipoprotein(a)

A significant positive correlation exists between average daily net carbohydrate intake and Lipoprotein(a) levels. This means higher net carb intakes are correlated with higher Lipoprotein(a), and lower net carb intakes are correlated with lower Lipoprotein(a).

*   **Previous Intake (prior to Test 6):** Averaged 225 grams of net carbs per day.
*   **Current Intervention (for Test 7):** Intentional reduction to an average of 192 grams of net carbs per day, with an expectation of lower Lipoprotein(a) levels.

### Total Fat and Lipoprotein(a)

A significant inverse correlation exists between average daily total fat intake and Lipoprotein(a) levels. Higher total fat intakes are correlated with lower Lipoprotein(a), and lower fat intakes are correlated with higher Lipoprotein(a).

*   **Previous Intake (prior to Test 6):** Averaged 84 grams of total fat per day.
*   **Current Intervention (for Test 7):** Intentional increase to an average of 101 grams of total fat per day, with an expectation of lower Lipoprotein(a) levels.

### Monounsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFA) and Lipoprotein(a)

Among different fat types, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) show the strongest (though not statistically significant with P-value 0.06) inverse correlation with Lipoprotein(a) levels. This suggests that higher MUFA intake may be associated with lower Lipoprotein(a).

*   **Previous Intake (prior to Test 6):** Averaged 29 grams of MUFA per day.
*   **Current Intervention (for Test 7):** Intentional increase to an average of 41 grams of MUFA per day (the highest intake recorded over 10 years of testing), to assess its effect on Lipoprotein(a).

The efficacy of these dietary interventions for Lipoprotein(a) will be evaluated with the upcoming Test 7, results for which are anticipated by the end of November.
