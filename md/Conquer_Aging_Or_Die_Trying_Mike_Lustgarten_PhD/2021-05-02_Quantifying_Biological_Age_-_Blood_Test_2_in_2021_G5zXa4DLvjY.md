# 2021-05-02 Quantifying Biological Age - Blood Test 2 in 2021

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age assessment using Levine's Phenotypic Age Calculator indicates an age of 36, which is 12.2 years younger than the chronological age of 48.
*   Aging.ai 3.0 estimates a biological age of 27, 21 years younger than the chronological age, using 19 biomarkers from standard chem panels and CBC.
*   A previous attempt to reduce High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) by increasing HDL levels was unsuccessful, with hs-CRP increasing nearly fourfold and HDL decreasing slightly.
*   Monounsaturated Fatty Acid (MUFA) intake shows a significant negative correlation (r = -0.61) with hs-CRP, suggesting that higher MUFA intake is associated with lower hs-CRP levels.
*   Increasing MUFA intake is unlikely to negatively impact other biomarkers assessed by Levine's test, as correlations with the other eight biomarkers are weak (absolute correlation coefficient < 0.3).

## Biological Age Assessment

### Levine's Phenotypic Age Calculator

*   **Chronological Age:** 48 years
*   **Biological Age:** 36 years
*   **Difference:** 12.2 years younger than chronological age

**Biomarkers Associated with Youthful Phenotype and Reduced All-Cause Mortality Risk:**

*   Albumin
*   Percentage of lymphocytes
*   Average red blood cell volume (MCV)
*   Red blood cell distribution width (RDW)
*   Alkaline phosphatase
*   White blood cells

**Biomarkers with Room for Improvement:**

*   Creatinine (lower levels are desirable)
*   Glucose (lower levels are desirable)

**High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP):**

*   **Current Level:** 1.01 mg/L
*   **Previous Level:** 0.27 mg/L
*   **Change:** Increased nearly fourfold

### Aging.ai 3.0

*   **Methodology:** Utilizes 19 biomarkers found on standard chemistry panels and complete blood count (CBC).
*   **Biological Age:** 27 years
*   **Difference:** 21 years younger than chronological age

**Note:** Aging.ai does not include chronological age in its calculation, potentially allowing for larger reductions in biological age.

## C-Reactive Protein (CRP) Improvement Strategy

### Previous Intervention and Outcome

*   **Goal:** Reduce hs-CRP by increasing HDL.
*   **Previous HDL Level:** 49 mg/dL
*   **Observed Outcome:**
    *   HDL decreased slightly.
    *   hs-CRP increased nearly fourfold.
*   **Conclusion:** The strategy of increasing HDL to reduce CRP was unsuccessful.

### Future Plan for Improving CRP

**Step 1: Investigate Macronutrient Correlations with CRP**
*   **Methodology:** Analyze correlations between dietary macronutrient intake and hs-CRP levels.
*   **Macronutrients Examined:**
    *   Total calorie intake
    *   Total fat intake
    *   Monounsaturated fat intake
    *   Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acid intake (as measures of polyunsaturated fats)
    *   Saturated fat intake
    *   Fiber intake
    *   Protein intake

**Step 2: Investigate Correlations for Individual Foods and Micronutrients with CRP**
*   This analysis was not completed at the time of the transcript due to data processing time constraints but may be presented in a future video.

**Key Finding from Macronutrient Analysis:**

*   **Monounsaturated Fatty Acid (MUFA) Intake:**
    *   **Correlation:** A higher average daily intake of MUFAs was significantly correlated with lower hs-CRP levels.
    *   **Correlation Coefficient:** -0.61
    *   **Statistical Significance:** P-value indicates statistical significance.

    *   **Visual Representation of Correlation:**
        ```
        hs-CRP (mg/L) ^
                      |     .
                      |   .
                      | .
                      +------------> MUFA Intake (g/day)
        ```

### Impact of Increasing MUFA Intake on Other Biomarkers

*   **Assessment:** Evaluate the correlation of average daily MUFA intake with the other eight biomarkers included in Levine's test.
*   **Findings:**
    *   Correlations between MUFA intake and the other eight biomarkers were weak.
    *   Correlation coefficients were less than 0.3 or greater than -0.3.
*   **Conclusion:** Increasing MUFA intake is unlikely to negatively affect the other biomarkers on Levine's test.

### Next Blood Test Goal

*   **Target MUFA Intake:** Approximately 20 grams per day.
*   **Expected Outcome:** Based on the observed correlation, an increase in MUFA intake to 20 g/day is expected to lead to a corresponding reduction in hs-CRP.
*   **Preferred Sources of MUFAs:**
    *   Almonds
    *   Cashews
