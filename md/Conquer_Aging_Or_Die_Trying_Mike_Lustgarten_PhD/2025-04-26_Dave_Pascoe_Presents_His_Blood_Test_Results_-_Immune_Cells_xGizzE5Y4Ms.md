# 2025-04-26 Dave Pascoe Presents His Blood Test Results - Immune Cells

### Executive Summary

*   Dave's **neutrophils** are stable and at the lower end of the optimal range (2000-3000 cells/µL), which is favorable for all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Lymphocyte** levels show an age-related decline, trending from approximately 1300 cells/µL in 2021 down to 1100 cells/µL, falling below the optimal target of 2000 cells/µL associated with youth and lowest mortality risk.
*   **Monocyte** counts are stable and at good levels (around 0.2-0.3), effectively resisting the typical age-related increase.
*   **Lymphocyte percentage** is also declining, consistent with the observed total lymphocyte trends. While higher percentages are potentially better with aging, all-cause mortality risk data for this specific metric is not yet established.
*   **Platelet** counts are stable and within the optimal range of 200-300 (x10^9/L), which is associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk.

## Immune Cell Overview

White blood cells, a component of PhenoAge, are not a homogeneous group. They consist of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils. Focus is primarily placed on neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes as they constitute approximately 95% or more of the total.

A key disparity in immune cell behavior during aging is that neutrophils and monocytes tend to increase, while lymphocytes decrease. This dynamic means that total white blood cell counts can remain stable, giving a false sense of security, while the underlying cell proportions shift towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype (increasing neutrophils, decreasing lymphocytes). Therefore, analyzing individual counts for neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes provides the most valuable insight.

## Neutrophils

Dave's neutrophil data is stable, with the trend line resting just above 2000 cells/µL. The Lustgarten optimal range for neutrophils is 2000 to 3000 cells/µL. Aiming for the lower end of this range is considered optimal based on all-cause mortality risk.

The question of how low is optimal, given that neutrophils increase during aging, is somewhat debatable. There is an observed increase in all-cause mortality risk for levels below 2000 cells/µL. However, this could be influenced by reverse causation, where individuals with very low neutrophil levels may also have underlying inflammation. If neutrophil levels are below 2000 cells/µL, it is advisable to check HS-CRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein). A low HS-CRP (e.g., 0.3 mg/L or less) alongside low neutrophils suggests a healthy profile. Conversely, if HS-CRP is elevated (e.g., 1.0-1.2 mg/L) with low neutrophils, it could indicate a problem in neutrophil production, with existing neutrophils contributing to inflammation. Dave's neutrophil levels are favorable, with the trend line positioned at the bottom of the optimal range.

## Lymphocytes

Lymphocytes typically decline with aging, a trend also observed in Dave's data. The trend line shows a decline from approximately 1300 cells/µL in 2021 to around 1100 cells/µL currently. The goal is to raise these levels closer to 2000 cells/µL, which is characteristic of youth and associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk.

Dave's current levels are significantly below 2000 cells/µL. However, his data exhibits variability; for instance, last year, levels were close to 1600 cells/µL, while two years ago, they reached as low as 900 cells/µL. The objective is to mitigate these low troughs and maintain higher levels. Even an increase from 1300 cells/µL to 1600 cells/µL, flattening the decline, would be a positive initial step in resisting age-related decline. Lymphocyte levels are malleable, and dietary or lifestyle changes can influence them.

## Monocytes

Monocyte levels typically increase with aging. Dave's data shows resistance to this age-related increase, which is a positive indicator. His monocyte values are consistently good, generally around 0.2 to 0.3.

There might be minor discrepancies in reported values due to laboratory rounding (e.g., a reported percentage multiplied by total white blood cells versus a rounded absolute number). However, this rounding issue does not significantly alter the data range from 0.2-0.3 to, for example, 0.4-0.6. Overall, Dave's monocyte levels are favorable.

## Lymphocyte Percentage

Lymphocyte percentage also declines during aging. A higher percentage is potentially considered better, though robust studies linking lymphocyte percentage to all-cause mortality risk are currently unavailable, with data primarily focusing on age-related changes. This decline in percentage is consistent with the observed decrease in total lymphocyte levels. While total white blood cell counts may remain stable, the declining lymphocyte percentage reflects the underlying shift in immune cell composition. The aim is to resist age-related changes and maintain levels within an optimal range.

## Platelets

Platelet counts generally decline with aging. Dave's data shows stable platelet levels, which is a favorable finding. The optimal range for platelets, based on all-cause mortality risk, is between 200 and 300 (x10^9/L). Levels below or above this range are associated with an increased risk.

Considering the age-related decline, a higher value (closer to 300) might intuitively seem better. However, biomarker-versus-biomarker analysis in some data suggests that levels closer to 200 might be more advantageous. Dave's stable values within this optimal range are good. A decline in platelet counts would serve as another indicator requiring attention.
