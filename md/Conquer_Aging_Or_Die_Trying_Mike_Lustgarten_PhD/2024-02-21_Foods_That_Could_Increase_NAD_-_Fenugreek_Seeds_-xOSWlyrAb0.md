# 2024-02-21 Foods That Could Increase NAD - Fenugreek Seeds

## Executive Summary

*   Trigonelline, also known as 1-methylnicotinic acid, is a compound found in fenugreek seeds that may increase NAD levels.
*   The trigonelline content in fenugreek seeds can vary significantly between studies, ranging from 1.3 mg/g to 98.4 mg/g.
*   Ingesting an average of 21 grams of fenugreek seeds daily, providing approximately 55 mg of trigonelline, did not result in a significant increase in personal NAD levels.
*   NAD levels remained within a narrow range (25.6-26.6 micromolar) without NAD precursors, suggesting that fenugreek seeds, at the tested dose, may have a minimal or no impact on NAD levels in this individual.
*   Further investigation with higher trigonelline intake, possibly through alfalfa sprouts, is being considered to determine its effect on NAD levels.

## Trigonelline and NAD

Trigonelline (1-methylnicotinic acid) is a compound found in fenugreek seeds that has been observed to increase NAD levels in mice. This study explores the potential of fenugreek seeds as a source of trigonelline for human NAD level modulation.

## Fenugreek Seed Trigonelline Content

The trigonelline content in fenugreek seeds varies widely across different studies:

*   **Study 1:** 2.6% trigonelline (2.6 mg trigonelline per gram of fenugreek seeds). This is noted as seven times more than in chickpeas.
*   **Study 2:** 91.2 mg trigonelline per gram of fenugreek seeds.
*   **Study 3:** 98.4 mg trigonelline per gram of fenugreek seeds.
*   **Study 4:** 1,300 parts per million (1.3 mg trigonelline per gram of fenugreek seeds).

## Personal NAD Level Analysis with Fenugreek Seeds

To assess the impact of fenugreek seeds on NAD levels, the following protocol was followed:

*   **Duration:** 11 days prior to testing.
*   **Dosage:** An average of 21 grams of fenugreek seeds were added to the daily diet.
*   **Preparation:** Initially raw, but due to hardness, seeds were ground and added to a cooked meal.
*   **Trigonelline Intake Calculation:**
    *   Using the lowest trigonelline content (2.6 mg/g), 21 grams of fenugreek seeds yield approximately 55 mg of trigonelline per day.
    *   Other dietary sources (banana, barley, chickpeas, oats, oranges) contributed an additional 13 mg of trigonelline daily.
    *   Total estimated daily trigonelline intake: 68 mg.

### NAD Level Results

*   **February 2nd Test (after 11 days of fenugreek seeds):** NAD level was 26.6 micromolar.
*   **Comparison to Previous Tests:**
    *   NAD levels without NAD precursors have historically ranged between 18.5 and 25.6 micromolar.
    *   The highest recorded NAD level without precursors was 25.6 micromolar.
    *   The test on February 2nd (26.6 micromolar) represents a minor increase, potentially within the range of test-to-test variation.

### Potential Factors Affecting Results

*   **Variable Trigonelline Content:** The significantly lower trigonelline content found in a fourth study (1.3 mg/g) could have reduced the actual intake to around 40 mg per day, potentially explaining the small NAD increase.
*   **Test-to-Test Variation:** Inherent variability in NAD measurements could also account for the observed increase.

## NAD Levels with and without Precursors

*   **Without NAD Precursors:** NAD levels have consistently been at or below 26 micromolar, with a historical high of 25.6 micromolar. The 26.6 micromolar reading after fenugreek consumption suggests a potential upward shift within the upper range of normal, possibly mitigating lower readings like 18.5 micromolar.
*   **With NAD Precursors (e.g., NMN):** NAD levels have consistently exceeded 26 micromolar, even with 300 mg of NMN per day, which resulted in a reading of 25.3 micromolar in one instance.

## Future Directions

The trigonelline and NAD experiment is temporarily paused. The focus is shifting to:

*   **Alfalfa Sprouts:** Incorporating alfalfa sprouts into the diet, which also contain trigonelline, in larger quantities (up to 100 grams per day).
*   **Home-grown Sprouts:** Considering growing own sprouts due to the expense of commercially available ones, which could lead to a Part 3 of this series.
