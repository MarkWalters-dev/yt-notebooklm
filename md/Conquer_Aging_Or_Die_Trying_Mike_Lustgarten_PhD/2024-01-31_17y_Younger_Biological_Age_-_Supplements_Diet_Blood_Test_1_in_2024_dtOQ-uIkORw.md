# 2024-01-31 17y Younger Biological Age - Supplements Diet Blood Test 1 in 2024

## Executive Summary
*   Biological age, as calculated by the PhenoAge calculator, was 17 years younger than chronological age.
*   Dietary experiments included the addition of oranges (rich in proline betaine) and chickpeas (rich in trigoneline) to expand the methyl donor pool. This intervention correlated with a decrease in homocysteine from a previous 15-test average of 10.5 micromolar to 9.6 micromolar in the current test.
*   The individual achieved their lowest average daily calorie intake (2092 kcal/day) since tracking began in 2015, a result of small, consistent reductions aimed at sustainable fat loss and stable biomarkers.
*   Macronutrient composition was intentionally kept consistent across tests (average net macros: 44% total fat, 38% net carbs, 18.6% total protein) to maintain stability in biological age markers.
*   All essential micronutrient Recommended Daily Allowances (RDAs) were met, with many micronutrients consumed at levels purposefully higher than the RDA based on their observed correlations with multiple blood biomarkers, slow-wave sleep, and blood pressure.

## Supplements
*   **Levothyroxine:** 137.5 micrograms/day (for hypothyroidism, taken since early twenties).
*   **Vitamin D:** 1000 IU/day for all 49 days of the study period (non-summer months, 8-9 months/year). The 49-day period for this test spanned from 11/27/2023 to 01/14/2024.
*   **Methylfolate:** 400 micrograms/day for 18 of the 49 days, reduced due to increased dietary folate intake.
*   **Methyl B12:** 1000 micrograms/day for all 49 days, correlated with lower homocysteine levels.
*   **Nicotinic Acid:** Supplemented for only 2 of the 49 days, primarily on exercise days, to provide an NAD boost without potentially impacting the epigenetic pace of aging (Dunedin Pace) long-term.
    *   Higher niacin intake, including supplemental nicotinic acid, is associated with higher heart rate variability and lower resting heart rate (closer to youthful status), even after adjusting for body weight.
*   No other purported geroprotectors or senolytics were used during this period.

## Dietary Strategy
The average daily dietary intake for the 49-day period corresponding to this blood test was meticulously tracked.
*   **Diet Tracking Protocol:**
    1.  Weigh all daily food intake on a food scale.
    2.  Enter data into Cronometer.
    3.  Manually transfer all data into an Excel spreadsheet.
    4.  Align each blood test with the corresponding average dietary intake.

During this period, 48 different foods were consumed. The top calorie contributor was sardines.

## Dietary Experiments and Methyl Donors
To create caloric room for dietary experiments, strawberry intake was reduced by approximately 150 grams per day (from a usual 600 grams/day), and yogurt intake was also reduced.

*   **Experiment 1: Oranges for Proline Betaine**
    *   **Goal:** Expand the methyl donor pool to potentially reduce homocysteine or impact epigenetic methylation.
    *   **Reasoning:** Oranges are a rich source of proline betaine (dimethylproline), containing 510 micrograms per gram.
    *   **Intake:** Average of 63 grams of oranges per day, yielding 32 milligrams of proline betaine per day.
    *   **Biological Process:** Proline Betaine (dimethylproline) -> Methyl Donor -> Reduces Homocysteine OR Impacts Epigenetic Methylation (Horvath/Dunedin Pace).
    *   **Comparison to Trimethylglycine (TMG):** While TMG is a known methyl donor, previous attempts with up to 3 grams/day of TMG had no effect on homocysteine, possibly due to saturation from other dietary sources (e.g., beets). The aim is to expand the methyl donor pool using other di- or tri-methylated amino acids like proline betaine or tryptophan betaine (trimethyltryptophan).
    *   **Homocysteine Impact:** Current homocysteine level was 9.6 micromolar (January 15 test), an improvement from the previous 15-test average of 10.5 micromolar. This suggests a positive trend towards the desired youthful range of 5-6 micromolar.

*   **Experiment 2: Chickpeas for Trigoneline**
    *   **Goal:** Increase the methyl donor pool and potentially increase NAD levels.
    *   **Reasoning:** Chickpeas are a rich source of trigoneline (one methylnicotinate).
    *   **Biological Process:** Trigoneline (one methylnicotinate) -> converted to Nicotinic Acid -> Methyl Donor -> Impacts Homocysteine & Methylation Pathways.
    *   **NAD Goal:** Trigoneline is also hypothesized to potentially increase NAD. Data on NAD impact will be presented in a future update.
    *   **Homocysteine Impact:** The combined inclusion of chickpeas and oranges contributed to the observed reduction in homocysteine.

*   **Caloric Adjustment:** To incorporate chickpeas without increasing total calorie intake, oats and barley intake were reduced by approximately 50 grams per day (from a usual 25-30 grams each).

*   **"Cheat Meals":** The diet included a maximum of two "cheat meals" per 49-day period. For this test, it consisted of chocolate chips mixed with sweetened condensed milk and peanut butter. These meals contributed 551 calories (chocolate chips) and 476 calories (sweetened condensed milk) over two separate days. The diet was 99% "clean" and 1% "junk" during this period, with biomarkers guiding the frequency of such meals.

## Macronutrient Composition
*   **Average Daily Calorie Intake:** 2092 calories/day. This represents the lowest average daily calorie intake since diet tracking began in April 2015 (previous low: 2106 for test #7 in 2023). This gradual, small reduction strategy is adopted for sustainable weight and fat loss maintenance.
*   **Protein Intake:** 97 grams/day (18.6% of total calories).
*   **Fat Intake:** 81.2 grams/day (35% of total calories). Macronutrient consistency is a deliberate strategy to maintain stable biological age biomarkers across tests.
*   **Carbohydrate Intake:**
    *   Total Carbs: 283 grams/day.
    *   Fiber Intake: 86 grams/day.
    *   Net Carbs: 197 grams/day (38% of total calories).
    *   **Fiber's Caloric Contribution:** Soluble fiber (approx. 2 calories/gram) is converted into short-chain fatty acids, contributing approximately 185 calories (9% of total calories) to total fat.
*   **Net Macros (Adjusted for Fiber's Caloric Contribution):**
    *   Total Fat: 44%
    *   Net Carbs: 38%
    *   Total Protein: 18.6%
*   **Fructose Intake:** The individual focuses on limiting total fructose intake due to observed correlations with biomarkers moving in unfavorable directions. For this test, average daily fructose intake (fructose + half of sucrose) was 61 grams/day. This is close to the lowest intake recorded since 2015 (57 grams/day) and approximately half of the highest historical intake.

## Micronutrients
*   All essential Recommended Daily Allowances (RDAs) for vitamins and minerals were met.
*   Many micronutrients were consumed at levels purposefully higher than their RDAs. This strategy is based on observed correlations between these higher intakes and multiple blood biomarkers, slow-wave sleep, and blood pressure.
