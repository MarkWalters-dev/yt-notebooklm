# 2023-08-27 Blood Test 5 in 2023 - My Worst Data Of The Year

## Executive Summary

*   **Phenotypic Age:** The most recent blood test yielded a biological age of 38.9 years using the Levine test, which is 11.7 years younger than chronological age. However, this is a decline from the previous trend of being 16 years younger, making it the worst data in five years.
*   **Lymphocyte Percentage:** The lymphocyte percentage, a marker that typically declines with age, showed a significant drop to 25.7%, deviating from the consistent 41.6% average observed since 2015.
*   **Platelet Count:** Platelet count, another marker that declines with age and is associated with all-cause mortality risk when below 200, dropped to 179. While not unprecedented, it's a concerning trend in an aging context.
*   **Aging.ai Predicted Age:** The aging.ai calculator predicted an age of 33 years, 17 years younger than chronological age. While still good, it represents a slight increase from previous optimal results, and markers like glucose, BUN, and creatinine moved in an unfavorable direction.
*   **White Blood Cell Subtypes:** While total white blood cell count was within the reference range, neutrophils (3578) and lymphocytes (1362) were outside of proposed optimal ranges associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk, trending in a direction that indicates aging.

## Phenotypic Age (Levine Test)

*   **Current Biological Age:** 38.9 years (11.7 years younger than chronological age).
*   **Trend Comparison:** This is a decline from the recent trend of being 16 years younger than chronological age.
*   **Historical Data:**
    *   2018-2019 (3 tests): Average biological age of 36.1 years.
    *   2020-2021 (12 tests): Average biological age of 35.6 years.
    *   2022 (7 tests): Average biological age of 33.8 years.
    *   2023 (thus far, including this test): Average biological age of 34.7 years.
*   **Outlier Observation:** The most recent test result of 38.9 years is a significant outlier compared to previous data points since 2020.
*   **High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP):** Quest hs-CRP measurement was <0.3 mg/L for the 12th consecutive test, indicating low inflammation.

## Lymphocyte Percentage

*   **Age-Related Decline (General Population):** Lymphocyte percentage declines with aging. In men, it decreases from approximately 28% to 18%. In women, it decreases from around 27% to 22%, with potential biphasic responses related to childbirth and menopause.
*   **Personal Data (2003-2023):**
    *   2003-2008 (3 tests): Average lymphocyte percentage of ~41%.
    *   2015-2023 (43 tests): Average lymphocyte percentage of 41.6%.
    *   No significant age-related decline observed in historical data.
*   **Most Recent Data Point:** 25.7%, which is a significant deviation from the historical average and the general population trend.
*   **Potential Factors:**
    *   Increased tryptophan intake (from 1g/day to 3g/day). This change has been removed to observe its effect.

## Platelet Count

*   **Age-Related Decline:** Platelets decline with age, from approximately 231 to 209 in men between ages 20 and 100.
*   **Mortality Risk:** Platelet counts <200 and >300 are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   <200: 8% increased risk.
    *   <100: 93% increased risk.
*   **Personal Data (2008-2015):**
    *   2008-2013 (6 tests): Average platelet count of 210.
    *   2015-2023 (43 tests): Average platelet count of 229.
*   **Most Recent Data Point:** 179. While some previous data points were low, this is a rare occurrence and represents a concerning trend.
*   **Goal:** To identify correlations with diet and supplements to increase platelet count above 200.

## Aging.ai Predicted Age

*   **Current Predicted Age:** 33 years (17 years younger than chronological age).
*   **Trend Comparison:** This is not as optimal as previous best data points for aging.ai.
*   **Unfavorable Biomarkers:** Glucose, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine moved in an unfavorable direction.
*   **Historical Data (aging.ai):**
    *   2008-2013 (3 tests): Average aging.ai age of 32 years.
    *   2016-2022 (34 tests): Average aging.ai age of 29.8 years.
    *   2023 (thus far): Average aging.ai age of 30.4 years.
*   **Overall Consistency:** Despite the recent increase, the average aging.ai age since 2008 remains consistently within the 30-32 year range.
*   **Potential Factors:** Tryptophan supplementation (in addition to diet and other supplements, to be detailed in a future video).

## White Blood Cell (WBC) Subtypes

*   **Total WBC Count:** 5.3 (within the reference range of 3.8 to 10.8, and the proposed optimal range of 3.5 to 6).
*   **Neutrophils:**
    *   Current: 3578.
    *   Proposed Optimal Range: 2000-3000.
    *   Trend: Moving in an unfavorable direction (higher than optimal).
*   **Lymphocytes:**
    *   Current: 1362.
    *   Proposed Optimal Range: Around 2000.
    *   Trend: Moving in an unfavorable direction (declining with aging).
*   **Significance:** Focusing on total WBC count can be misleading; examining neutrophils and lymphocytes provides more informative insights into health and aging.

## Other Biomarkers and Future Investigations

*   **Red Blood Cells:** 5.3 (within reference range).
*   **Lipid Panel, CRP, Glucose:** Reviewed on Page 2 of the report.
*   **Potential Impact of Supplements:**
    *   **Serine (6g/day) and Vitamin B6 (8x baseline):** Investigated for impact on homocysteine (data to be presented later).
    *   **DHEA Sulfate:** Progress in increasing levels to be assessed.
    *   **Tryptophan (2g/day):** Potential impact on NAD levels (via de novo NAD synthesis pathway) is under investigation. NAD results are pending.
*   **Epigenetic and Telomere Data:** Blood samples were sent for analysis on August 21st; results will be presented in future videos.
