# 2023-07-02 Metabolite Ratios As An Index Of Oxidative Stress

### Executive Summary
*   Oxidative stress, a key hallmark of aging, can be quantitatively assessed using specific metabolite ratios, offering an alternative to traditional oxidative damage markers.
*   The ratio of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to reduced glutathione (GSH) is a primary indicator; a higher GSSG:GSH ratio signifies elevated oxidative stress due to reactions with reactive oxygen species like hydrogen peroxide.
*   Similarly, the cysteine to cystine ratio reflects oxidative stress; an increase in this ratio, representing more oxidized forms, is associated with increasing age.
*   The methionine sulfoxide to methionine ratio also serves as an index of oxidative stress, with methionine sulfoxide levels observed to be higher in centenarians compared to younger individuals.
*   The overarching goal for optimal health is to prevent age-related increases in these oxidative stress-indicating metabolite ratios.

## Introduction to Oxidative Stress Quantification

Oxidative stress is a recognized hallmark of aging, specifically implicated within mitochondrial dysfunction. While commonly measured by quantifying oxidative damage to nucleic acids (DNA, RNA), lipids, and proteins, metabolite ratios can also provide valuable insights into oxidative stress levels.

## Glutathione Ratio (GSSG:GSH)

The reduced to oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH:GSSG) is a prominent indicator of oxidative stress.

**Metabolic Process:**
Reduced Glutathione (GSH, thiol -SH) + Reduced Glutathione (GSH, thiol -SH) --(Oxidative Stress, e.g., H2O2)--> Oxidized Glutathione (GSSG, disulfide bridge -S-S-)

A high GSSG:GSH ratio is indicative of relatively high levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or general oxidative stress. Currently, individual GSH and GSSG levels are not widely available commercially, making it difficult to measure this specific ratio directly. However, other metabolite ratios can also evaluate oxidative stress.

## Cysteine to Cystine Ratio

The cysteine to cystine ratio functions similarly to the GSH:GSSG ratio as an indicator of oxidative stress.

**Metabolic Process:**
Cysteine (thiol -SH) + Cysteine (thiol -SH) --(Oxidative Stress)--> Cystine (disulfide bridge -S-S-)

A relatively high amount of cystine relative to cysteine is indicative of relatively high oxidative stress. The oxidized form, cystine, can be reduced back to cysteine, but this pathway is outside the scope of this discussion.

### Age-Related Changes in Cysteine to Cystine Ratio
Recent research indicates that the cysteine to cystine ratio increases during aging. This association is statistically significant (p-value and false discovery rate < 0.05), with a positive age beta coefficient demonstrating that with increasing age, there is an increase in the oxidized to reduced ratio for cysteine to cystine. The optimal goal for this ratio is to avoid an age-related increase.

Notably, another ratio associated with age in the same study was the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio, which is part of the de novo NAD synthesis pathway.

### Individual Data: Cysteine to Cystine Ratio
Blood metabolomics data from April 2023 showed:
*   Cystine levels: 0.05 micromolar (50 nanomolar)
*   Cysteine levels: 9.5 micromolar
*   Cystine to Cysteine ratio: 0.06

The objective for future tests is to prevent an age-related increase in this ratio.

## Methionine Sulfoxide to Methionine Ratio

The methionine sulfoxide to methionine ratio can also serve as an index of oxidative stress.

**Metabolic Process:**
Methionine (sulfur atom) --(Oxidative Stress, e.g., H2O2)--> Methionine Sulfoxide (oxidized sulfur, S=O)

Similar to cysteine, methionine sulfoxide can be reduced back to methionine by the enzyme methionine sulfoxide reductase.

### Age-Related Changes in Methionine Sulfoxide
A 2022 paper, while not directly comparing the methionine sulfoxide to methionine ratio, demonstrated that methionine sulfoxide levels were higher in centenarians (average age 97 years) compared to their offspring and spouses (average age 67 years). This suggests an age-related increase in methionine sulfoxide, which aligns with the overall understanding that oxidative stress increases during aging. Therefore, avoiding an age-related increase in the methionine sulfoxide to methionine ratio is a key goal.

### Individual Data: Methionine Sulfoxide to Methionine Ratio
Baseline individual data for this ratio is as follows:
*   Methionine Sulfoxide levels: 0.79 micromolar
*   Methionine Sulfoxide to Methionine ratio: 0.05

Currently, there is limited published data on how the methionine sulfoxide to methionine ratio changes with aging to provide a definitive comparison. The objective is to monitor and aim to reduce methionine sulfoxide levels and subsequently this ratio over time, as a proxy for reducing oxidative stress.

## Methodology for Metabolomics Data Collection

In April 2023, blood was submitted for at-home metabolomics analysis.
*   **Kit Used:** IOLO kit
*   **Metabolite Coverage:** The kit measures over 500 metabolites, including kynurenine, tryptophan (involved in de novo NAD synthesis), taurine, and polyamines (both linked to lifespan extension).
*   **Purpose:** To generate baseline data for various metabolites and monitor changes over time, particularly for those linked to aging and oxidative stress.
