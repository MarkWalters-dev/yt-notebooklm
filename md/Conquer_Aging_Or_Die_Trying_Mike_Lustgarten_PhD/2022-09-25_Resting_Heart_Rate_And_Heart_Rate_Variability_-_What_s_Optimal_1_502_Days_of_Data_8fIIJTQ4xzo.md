# 2022-09-25 Resting Heart Rate And Heart Rate Variability - What s Optimal 1 502 Days of Data

## Executive Summary
*   Resting heart rate (RHR) generally increases until age 50, then declines. While low RHR can indicate both youth and advanced age, its context with heart rate variability (HRV) is crucial.
*   Heart rate variability (HRV) typically declines with age. However, studies suggest that higher-than-expected HRV in very old age (80-99+) may serve as a marker of longevity.
*   In youth, a low RHR is accompanied by high HRV, whereas in advanced age (after the RHR decline), a low RHR is typically accompanied by low HRV. This distinction helps differentiate cardiovascular youth from advanced age.
*   Individual tracking over four years demonstrated a significant reduction in RHR and an increase in HRV, suggesting a state of cardiovascular youth. This improvement was strongly correlated with a reduction in body weight.
*   Body weight negatively correlates with RHR (lower weight, lower RHR) and positively correlates with HRV (lower weight, higher HRV). Additionally, daily physical activity levels significantly impact next-day RHR and HRV, highlighting the importance of balancing activity and rest days for optimal cardiovascular health.

## Resting Heart Rate (RHR) and Aging
The speaker investigates whether aging can be slowed by tracking and optimizing biomarkers of organ and systemic health, focusing on cardiovascular fitness metrics like resting heart rate (RHR) and heart rate variability (HRV).

Average resting heart rate (RHR) data from 20-50 year olds shows an increase for both men and women. Data extending from 20-85 years confirms RHR increases up to around 50 years of age, then declines from approximately 50 to 85 years old. This implies that relatively low resting heart rates are found both in youth and in older age, necessitating further context to interpret.

## Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Definition
Heart rate variability (HRV) is defined as the variability in the time between heartbeats. For example, for a heart rate of 60 beats per minute, the assumption is the heart beats exactly once per second, but this is not always true. The time intervals between consecutive heartbeats can differ (e.g., 859 ms, 793 ms, 726 ms). This variability is calculated as HRV. The tracking device used by the speaker specifically provides the Root Mean Squared of Successive Differences (RMSSD) as its HRV measure.

## Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Aging
HRV (RMSSD) generally declines during aging. A large study of over 8.2 million people aged 20-60 years indicated median RMSSD values of about 75 ms in 20-year-olds, declining to approximately 35-40 ms in 60-year-olds. The data also showed that HRV is higher in the morning compared to nighttime measurements.

Another study examining individuals up to 79 years old confirmed the decline in HRV during aging, from 53 ms down to 19 ms. However, an interesting trend appeared in individuals aged 80-99 years, where HRV was higher than expected based on the age-related decline, with an RMSSD of 30 ms (comparable to someone in their late thirties). This suggests that a higher HRV than expected for chronological age may be a marker of longevity.

Further data from a small study of 17 centenarians (average age 102 years) showed a median HRV (RMSSD) of 36 ms. This was significantly higher than the 84-year-olds in the study, who had a median HRV of 24 ms. However, centenarians did not have higher HRV than very young adults (21-year-olds) who had an HRV of about 58 ms. These studies collectively suggest that having a higher HRV than expected based on chronological age may indicate longevity, though more extensive research is needed to confirm this.

## RHR and HRV in Context of Youth vs. Aging
To determine if a relatively low RHR is indicative of youth or aging, HRV provides crucial context:
*   At younger ages, individuals typically exhibit relatively lower RHRs and higher HRVs.
*   At older ages (beyond 60 years old), individuals may show lower RHRs but also relatively low HRVs.

## Individual Data: 1500+ Days of RHR and HRV Tracking
The speaker has tracked RHR and HRV since August 2018, accumulating over 1500 days of data. Based on population-based averages, an increasing RHR and declining HRV would be expected over this four-year period.

### Individual Resting Heart Rate Trends
Individual daily data for RHR shows a consistent reduction over the past four years. The average RHR declined from approximately 50-51 beats per minute (bpm) in 2018 to 44.9 bpm in 2022. Each subsequent year's average (2019-2022) was significantly lower than the preceding year (p < 0.05). This indicates that the speaker has successfully resisted and reversed the expected age-related increase in RHR.

### Individual Heart Rate Variability Trends
The speaker's HRV increased from an average of approximately 47 ms in 2018 to 59.4 ms in 2022. A significant increase occurred in 2019 (56 ms) compared to 2018. While 2020 (57.8 ms) was still significantly higher than 2018, it was not a significant year-over-year improvement from 2019. In 2021, HRV regressed to 51.9 ms, which was better than 2018 but significantly worse than 2020. A major goal for 2022 was to improve HRV, and the average thus far is 59.4 ms, better than both 2018 and 2021, indicating an overall increase in HRV over the four years despite a setback in 2021.

### Interpretation of Individual Data
The speaker's current HRV of 59 ms (2022) is well above the expected median of 35.1 ms for their chronological age (which will be 50 years old in January), putting it at best comparable to someone approximately 22 years younger. The combination of a relatively high HRV (59 ms) and a low RHR (45 bpm) suggests cardiovascular youth. In contrast, the expected values for the speaker's chronological age would be a lower HRV (35 ms) and a higher RHR (57 bpm). This favorable individual data strongly indicates cardiovascular youth.

## Factors Influencing RHR and HRV

### Body Weight
The speaker's average monthly body weight decreased from around 159 pounds in August 2018 to approximately 151-152 pounds in September 2022. This body weight reduction showed a clear relationship with RHR. Periods of reduced body weight correlated with declines in RHR, while periods of increased body weight correlated with RHR increases. A significant positive correlation was found between daily body weight and RHR, meaning RHR increases as body weight increases. Conversely, as body weight approached 150 pounds, RHR approached 45 bpm.

The relationship between body weight and HRV was also observed. As body weight declined, increases in HRV were seen, and conversely, as body weight increased, HRV decreased. A significant negative correlation was found between daily body weight and HRV, indicating that as body weight increases, HRV decreases. As body weight approached 150 pounds, HRV approached 60 ms. For the speaker, RHR and HRV approach youthful values as body weight decreases.

### Daily Physical Activity
Average daily heart rate (ADHR), tracked by the fitness device, is used as an index of daily physical activity. ADHR can be a more informative measure of effort than simply tracking steps, as activity intensity (e.g., walking on flat ground vs. uphill) impacts heart rate. It is important to note that non-workout stress can also elevate ADHR, potentially confounding activity-based interpretations.

A significant positive correlation exists between ADHR and next-day RHR. This suggests that excessive or too frequent daily activity can negatively impact RHR, leading to a higher next-day RHR.

A significant negative correlation was observed between ADHR and next-day HRV. This indicates that higher ADHR is correlated with a lower next-day HRV, again suggesting that too much daily activity, too often, can be detrimental to HRV.

### Optimizing Activity and Rest Days
Finding a balance between active and rest days is crucial for optimizing RHR and HRV. The speaker aims to achieve this balance through structured cycles:

**Exercise Cycle Protocol:**
*   On active days that include a usual workout, the average daily heart rate is typically 59 bpm.
*   Over the next 2-3 days, activity is purposely titrated downward, ensuring the average daily heart rate remains lower than 59 bpm.
*   This recovery period allows the cardiovascular system to recover and potentially enables maximum improvements for resting heart rate and heart rate variability.
*   Following the recovery days, another workout is performed.
*   The speaker primarily adheres to a 3-day cycle (workout + 2 lower-intensity days), but sometimes uses a 4-day cycle (workout + 3 lower-intensity days) due to work-life balance considerations.
