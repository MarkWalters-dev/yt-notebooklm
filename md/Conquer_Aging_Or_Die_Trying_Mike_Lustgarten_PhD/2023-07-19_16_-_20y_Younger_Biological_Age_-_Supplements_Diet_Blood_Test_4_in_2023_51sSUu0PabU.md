# 2023-07-19 16 - 20y Younger Biological Age - Supplements Diet Blood Test 4 in 2023

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age was estimated to be 16 years younger than chronological age using PhenoAge and 19 years younger using aging.ai.
*   The diet maintained consistency with previous tests in 2023, comprising 99.5% "clean" food and 0.5% "junk" food, with sardines being a top calorie contributor.
*   Average daily calorie intake was 2145, the lowest recorded since April 2015, contributing to sustained weight loss.
*   Macronutrient composition was approximately 42% fat, 40% net carbohydrates, and 18% protein, guided by blood biomarker correlations.
*   Total fructose intake was 58 grams per day, near the lowest recorded values since 2015.

## Biological Age Assessment

For blood test number four in 2023, biological age assessments indicated a significant rejuvenation:

*   **PhenoAge (Dr. Morgan Levine's calculator):** Approximately 16 years younger than chronological age.
*   **Aging.ai:** Approximately 19 years younger than chronological age.

## Supplements

The 72-day period preceding this blood test (April 24 to July 4) involved the following supplement regimen:

*   **Levothyroxine:** Daily, as prescribed for hypothyroidism diagnosed in the twenties.
*   **Vitamin D:** 1000 IU daily during non-summer months. Supplemented for 67 out of the 72 days; the remaining 5 days involved full-body sun exposure.
*   **Supplemental Serine:** 4.1 grams per day. This was a doubling of the intake compared to blood test number three.
*   **Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, P5P):** 36.3 milligrams per day. This was a tripling of the intake from 12 milligrams per day, with the aim of reducing homocysteine.
*   **Grape Seed Powder:** 6.1 grams per day for 19 of the 72 days, intended to impact NAD levels.
*   **Niacin (Nicotinic Acid):** 600 milligrams per day for the 9 days preceding the blood test, also intended to impact NAD levels.

## Diet Composition

The dietary intake over the 72-day period preceding blood test number four was largely consistent with previous 2023 tests. Food items are ranked from highest to lowest amount in grams, with green tea measured in ounces.

*   **Consistency:** The food items and amounts have been kept consistent throughout 2023 across the first four blood tests. This consistency is based on over 40 blood tests since 2015, where this diet composition has been associated with youthful biomarker data. Exceptions currently being investigated include Horvath's epigenetic test, DHEA sulfate, and homocysteine.
*   **Cheat Meals:** A maximum of two cheat meals are included per period between blood tests. For this test period, there was one cheat meal consisting of Nutella (150g), consumed immediately after the blood test. This represented 0.5% of total calories over the 72-day period, with the diet being 99.5% "clean."
*   **Top Calorie Contributors:** Sardines were again the top contributor to daily calories. The remaining top nine foods were consistent with earlier videos, though the order may vary.

### Macronutrient Composition

*   **Average Daily Calorie Intake:** 2145 calories. This is the lowest average daily calorie intake recorded since April 2015, representing a small but sustained reduction (average 20-30 calories per test over test).
    *   This consistent, small calorie reduction approach has resulted in sustained weight loss, unlike past attempts with larger calorie deficits.
    *   **Weight Loss Trend:** Body weight decreased from 154 pounds in October 2020 to 145 pounds in July 2023, maintained without reversals, likely due to the sustainability of small calorie adjustments. Strength has been preserved, with workouts remaining standardized.

*   **Protein Intake:** Approximately 99 grams per day (18% of total calories).
*   **Fat Intake:** Approximately 80 grams per day (33.6% of total calories).
    *   Breakdown includes monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, omega-3, omega-6, saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol.
*   **Carbohydrate Intake:**
    *   Total Carbohydrates: Approximately 296 grams per day.
    *   Fiber Intake: Approximately 86 grams per day.
    *   Net Carbohydrates: Approximately 212 grams per day (Total Carbs - Fiber).
    *   Net Carbohydrate Percentage of Diet: 39.5% (212g * 4 calories/g / total calories).
    *   **Fiber Calories:** Soluble fiber is fermented by gut bacteria into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), contributing calories. Approximately 189 calories from fiber (2.2 * 86g) were accounted for, representing 8.8% of total daily calorie intake.
*   **Net Macronutrient Composition:**
    *   Fat: 42%
    *   Net Carbohydrates: 40%
    *   Protein: 18%
    *   **Dietary Guidance:** This composition was not predetermined but evolved by following blood biomarker correlations with dietary changes, re-evaluating after each blood test.

*   **Total Fructose Intake:** 58 grams per day. This is close to the lowest recorded intake since 2015 (57.5 grams per day), indicating significant progress from previous intakes of around 115 grams per day.

## Micronutrients

*   **Vitamins:** Full Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) coverage was achieved for all vitamins. Many micronutrient levels are intentionally higher than the RDA, based on correlations with blood biomarkers.
    *   **Niacin Intake:** Average daily intake was approximately 117 mg, significantly exceeding the RDA of 15 mg. This higher intake (40 mg provided) was part of the strategy to potentially increase NAD.
*   **Minerals:** Mineral intake data was also collected.

## Future Updates

*   An upcoming video will provide an update on homocysteine levels.
*   The next video, coming on Sunday, will detail the impact of niacin supplementation on NAD.
*   A live stream is planned for late August to discuss the correlation between diet and blood biomarkers.
