# 2025-06-15 Low Uric Acid Is Associated With A Higher Odds Of Living To 100y

## Executive Summary

*   Lower uric acid levels (less than 4.17 mg/dL or 248 µmol/L) are associated with a 28% higher odds of living to 100 years.
*   Higher gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels (18-23 U/L or 0.31-0.39 µkat/L) are associated with a 33% higher odds of living to 100 years.
*   Higher glucose levels (greater than 108 mg/dL or 6 mmol/L) are associated with a 47% lower odds of living to 100 years.
*   Higher creatinine levels (greater than 1.14 mg/dL or 101 µmol/L) are associated with a 47% lower odds of living to 100 years.
*   Optimizing multiple biomarkers, both those associated with increased longevity and those associated with reduced longevity, is key for achieving centenarian status.

## Biomarkers and Longevity Association

This study investigated the association of various biomarkers with the odds of living to 100 years. The biomarkers analyzed included: total cholesterol, glucose, creatinine, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), albumin, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LD), iron, and total iron binding capacity (TIBC).

### Biomarkers Associated with Higher Odds of Living to 100 Years

**Uric Acid:**
*   **Low Levels:** Uric acid levels less than 4.17 mg/dL (248 µmol/L) were significantly associated with a 28% higher odds of living to 100 years.
    *   The proportion of centenarians with low uric acid levels was 4%. This was the lowest proportion observed among centenarians for any biomarker.
*   **High Levels:** Uric acid levels greater than 6.5 mg/dL (387 µmol/L) were significantly associated with a 46% lower odds of reaching 100 years.
    *   The proportion of centenarians with high uric acid levels was 1.2%. This was the highest proportion observed among centenarians for any biomarker.

**Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT):**
*   **Optimal Range:** GGT levels between 18-23 U/L (0.31-0.39 µkat/L) were associated with a 33% higher odds of living to 100 years.
    *   The proportion of centenarians with GGT in this range was 3.6%.
*   **High Levels:** GGT levels greater than 42 U/L (0.7 µkat/L) were associated with a 43% lower odds of reaching 100 years.

*Note: Both uric acid and GGT are known to increase with age. Resisting age-related increases in these biomarkers may be important for longevity.*

### Biomarkers Associated with Lower Odds of Living to 100 Years

**Total Cholesterol:**
*   **Low Levels:** Total cholesterol levels less than 201 mg/dL (5.2 mmol/L) were significantly associated with a 34% lower odds of living to 100 years.
    *   *Caveat:* The interpretation of low total cholesterol's impact on longevity is complex, as factors like comorbidities and BMI can influence this association.

**Glucose:**
*   **High Levels:** Glucose levels higher than 108 mg/dL (6 mmol/L) were associated with a 47% lower odds of living to 100 years.

**Creatinine:**
*   **High Levels:** Creatinine levels greater than 1.14 mg/dL (101 µmol/L) were associated with a 47% lower odds of reaching 100 years.

**Aspartate Aminotransferase (ASAT):**
*   **High Levels:** ASAT levels greater than 30.1 U/L (0.5 µkat/L) were associated with a 30% lower odds of reaching 100 years.
    *   *Note:* 30 U/L for ASAT is often within the normal reference range, highlighting that optimal ranges for longevity may differ from standard reference ranges.

**Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP):**
*   **High Levels:** ALP levels greater than 234 U/L (3.9 µkat/L) were associated with a 26% lower odds of reaching 100 years.

**Lactate Dehydrogenase (LD):**
*   **High Levels:** LD levels greater than 432 U/L (7.2 µkat/L) were associated with a 34% lower odds of reaching 100 years.

**Iron:**
*   **Low Levels:** Iron levels less than 73 µg/dL (13 µmol/L) were associated with a 28% lower odds of reaching 100 years.

**Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC):**
*   **High Levels:** TIBC levels greater than 358 µg/dL (64.1 µmol/L) were associated with a 37% lower odds of reaching 100 years.

## Conclusion

Optimizing a comprehensive set of biomarkers is crucial for longevity. This includes aiming for biomarker ranges associated with increased odds of living to 100 years and simultaneously limiting or avoiding ranges associated with decreased odds of longevity or increased risk of age-related decline.
