# 2024-02-04 Foods That Could Increase NAD - Chickpeas

## Executive Summary
*   Trigonelline, also known as 1-methylnicotinic acid, is a compound suspected to increase NAD levels, based on previous studies in Little (dwarf) mice.
*   An initial 27-day trial using 17 mg/day of net trigonelline (primarily from 69g/day of chickpeas) failed to increase the subject's baseline blood intracellular NAD levels (measured at 25.6 $\mu$M).
*   This baseline NAD level (25.6 $\mu$M) is consistent with prior measurements taken without NAD precursor supplementation.
*   A previous successful NAD boost (to $37.9 \mu$M) was achieved with $60 \text{ mg/day}$ of nicotinic acid, which trigonelline is converted into.
*   A subsequent experiment involving fenugreek seeds, aiming for a net intake of at least $60 \text{ mg/day}$ of trigonelline, has been initiated to determine if higher doses can elevate NAD.

## Trigonelline Content in Foods

Trigonelline (1-methylnicotinic acid) is a compound hypothesized to increase NAD levels.

### Chickpeas
*   **Trigonelline Content:** $0.35 \text{ mg/gram}$ ($350 \mu\text{g/gram}$) on a dry weight basis.

### Initial Study Protocol (Chickpeas)
The subject tested the effect of supplementary trigonelline derived from chickpeas over 27 days:

1.  **Chickpea Intake:** Averaged $69 \text{ grams/day}$ (dry weight).
2.  **Total Calculated Trigonelline from Chickpeas:** $69 \text{ g} \times 0.35 \text{ mg/g} = 24.15 \text{ mg/day}$.
3.  **Oat Adjustment:** Steel cut oats, also consumed ($30 \text{ g/day}$), contain $0.1$ to $0.2 \text{ mg/gram}$ of trigonelline.
4.  **Trigonelline Subtraction (from Oats):** Estimated $7 \text{ mg/day}$ subtracted.
5.  **Net Daily Trigonelline Intake:** $24.15 \text{ mg} - 7 \text{ mg} \approx 17 \text{ mg/day}$.

### Initial Results (17 mg/day Trigonelline)
*   **Test Date:** January 15.
*   **Blood Intracellular NAD Level:** $25.6 \mu\text{M}$.
*   **Conclusion:** $17 \text{ mg/day}$ of net trigonelline was insufficient to increase NAD levels above the subject's established baseline. NAD levels remained the same as prior tests without NAD precursors (baseline $\leq 26 \mu\text{M}$).

## Comparison with NAD Precursors

NAD levels were compared across various supplement periods:

*   **Baseline/No Precursors:** NAD levels never exceeded $26 \mu\text{M}$.
*   **17 mg/day Trigonelline (Chickpeas):** $25.6 \mu\text{M}$ (Baseline).
*   **300 mg/day NMN:** $25.3 \mu\text{M}$ (Effectively no change from baseline).
*   **NAD Precursor Use (General):** Most other tests using NAD precursors showed blood intracellular NAD levels $> 26 \mu\text{M}$.
*   **Nicotinic Acid (Positive Control):** $60 \text{ mg/day}$ of nicotinic acid (which trigonelline converts to) successfully increased NAD to $37.9 \mu\text{M}$.

## Second Study Setup (Fenugreek Seeds)

The second phase aims to achieve the $60 \text{ mg/day}$ effective dose by using foods with higher trigonelline content.

### Trigonelline Content in Fenugreek Seeds (Comparative)
Fenugreek seeds contain significantly higher levels of trigonelline than chickpeas, based on multiple studies:

*   **Study A:** $91.2 \text{ mg/gram}$.
*   **Study B:** $98.4 \text{ mg/gram}$.
    *   *Note:* Studies A and B suggest fenugreek contains 260 to 280 times more trigonelline than chickpeas.
*   **Study C:** $2.62 \text{ mg/gram}$ ($0.262\%$ concentration).
    *   *Note:* Even the lowest reported content ($2.62 \text{ mg/g}$) is approximately seven times higher than chickpeas ($0.35 \text{ mg/g}$).

### Second Study Protocol Goal
*   **Target Daily Trigonelline Intake:** $\geq 60 \text{ mg/day}$ (based on the $60 \text{ mg/day}$ nicotinic acid equivalent needed to raise NAD).
*   **Food Source:** Fenugreek seeds.
*   **Intake Duration:** 27 days prior to NAD testing.
*   **Expected Intake Calculation (Using Lowest Fenugreek Study Value):** The subject consumed $\approx 24 \text{ grams/day}$ of fenugreek seeds. Using the lowest published value ($2.62 \text{ mg/g}$): $24 \text{ g} \times 2.62 \text{ mg/g} \approx 62.88 \text{ mg/day}$.
*   **Potential Intake:** Based on studies showing $90-100 \text{ mg/g}$, the actual trigonelline intake could be substantially higher than $60 \text{ mg/day}$.

### Status
Blood was drawn to test the effect of this higher trigonelline dose on NAD levels; results are pending analysis.
