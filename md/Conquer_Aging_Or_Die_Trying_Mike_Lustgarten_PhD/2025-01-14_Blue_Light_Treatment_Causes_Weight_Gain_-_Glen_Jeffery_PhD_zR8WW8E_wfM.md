# 2025-01-14 Blue Light Treatment Causes Weight Gain - Glen Jeffery PhD

## Executive Summary

*   Red light exposure stimulates mitochondrial activity, increasing blood sugar uptake and potentially reducing diabetic risk.
*   Blue light exposure (specifically 420-450 nm) inhibits mitochondrial function, leading to decreased sugar utilization from the blood.
*   Mice exposed to blue light exhibited rapid and significant weight gain, more than doubling their weight gain by week four compared to controls.
*   This blue light-induced weight gain is attributed to the body's reduced ability to use blood sugar, leading to its storage as fat and the development of a diabetic state.
*   The findings suggest a direct link between light exposure, particularly blue light, and metabolic regulation, including weight control and susceptibility to diabetes.

## Effect of Red Light on Metabolism

Red light exposure has been observed to enhance mitochondrial activity. This increased activity leads to mitochondria drawing more sugar out of the blood. The physiological consequence of this is a shift away from a diabetic metabolic state.

**Process:**
Red Light -> Mitochondria work harder -> More sugar drawn from blood -> Moves away from a diabetic position

## Proposed Mechanism of Blue Light on Metabolism

Conversely, blue light is hypothesized to slow down mitochondrial function. When mitochondria operate less efficiently, they take less sugar out of the blood.

**Process:**
Blue Light -> Mitochondria slow down -> Less sugar taken from blood

## Mouse Study: Blue Light and Weight Gain

Mice exposed to blue light, within the 450-420 nm range, demonstrated rapid and substantial weight gain. A noticeable difference in weight was observed as early as week one between the blue light-exposed group and controls. By week four, the blue light-exposed mice had more than doubled their weight gain compared to the control group.

## Physiological Consequences of Blue Light Exposure

The reduced utilization of sugar in the bloodstream, resulting from inhibited mitochondrial activity due to blue light, leads to the sugar being stored as fat. This fat storage contributes to significant weight gain, and ultimately, these mice developed a diabetic condition. The data indicates that light, particularly blue light, plays a controlling role in these metabolic outcomes.

**Process:**
Blue Light (450-420 nm) -> Less sugar used by mitochondria -> Unused sugar stored as fat -> Enormous weight gain -> Mice become diabetic
