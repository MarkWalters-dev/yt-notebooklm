# 2023-10-18 Blood Test 6 in 2023 - 17-23y Younger Biological Age

## Executive Summary

*   The latest blood test indicates a phenotypic biological age of 34 years, which is 16.7 years younger than the chronological age.
*   The aging.ai biological age metric predicts an age of 28 years, 22.7 years younger than chronological age, showing stability over the past eight years.
*   HDL levels have recently improved and entered the optimal range (50-60 mg/dL) after struggling with lower levels since 2015.
*   Triglyceride levels have shown a concerning increase over the past four tests, moving in the wrong direction from previous stable levels.
*   Neutrophil count has twice fallen below 2,000 cells/µL in recent tests, a level associated with increased all-cause mortality risk in large studies.

## Phenotypic Age (Morgan Levine)

*   **Current Test Results:**
    *   Biological Age: 34 years
    *   Chronological Age: (Implied to be ~50.7 years)
    *   Age Difference: 16.7 years younger than chronological age.
*   **Historical Data (Pheno Age):**
    *   2018-2019 (Average of 28 tests): 36.1 years
    *   2020-2021 (Average of 12 tests): 35.6 years
    *   2022 (Average of 13 tests): 33.8 years
    *   2023 (Average of 6 tests, including recent test): 34.6 years
*   **Trend Analysis:**
    *   Significant reduction in phenotypic age from 2020-2021 (35.6 years) to the past two years (average 34.2 years), representing an average 1.4-year age reduction.
    *   The current result shows a rebound after a potential outlier test possibly influenced by tryptophan megadosing.
*   **Limitation:** Quest's high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) measurement has a detection limit of <0.3 mg/L, meaning the true CRP value may be lower.

## aging.ai Biological Age

*   **Current Test Results:**
    *   Predicted Age: 28 years
    *   Chronological Age: (Implied to be ~50.7 years)
    *   Age Difference: 22.7 years younger than chronological age.
*   **Historical Data (aging.ai Age):**
    *   2009-2013 (3 tests): 32 years
    *   2016-2022 (34 tests): 29.8 years
    *   2023 (Average of 6 tests): 30 years
*   **Trend Analysis:**
    *   aging.ai age has been stable at approximately 30 years old for the past eight years.

## Key Blood Biomarker Analysis

### Metabolic Markers

*   **HDL Cholesterol:**
    *   Current Level: 55 mg/dL (within optimal range of 50-60 mg/dL for men, associated with lowest all-cause mortality risk).
    *   Historical Trend: Average of 45 mg/dL over 43 tests since 2015.
    *   Recent Trend: Average of 53 mg/dL over the past four tests, showing recent improvement.
*   **Triglycerides:**
    *   Current Level: 72 mg/dL (below the <90 mg/dL threshold associated with lowest all-cause mortality risk).
    *   Historical Trend: Average of 58 mg/dL over 42 tests prior to the last four.
    *   Recent Trend: Average of 70 mg/dL over the past four tests, indicating a statistically significant increase and moving in the wrong direction.
*   **Glucose:**
    *   Levels consistently in the high eighties.
*   **Insulin:**
    *   Average of 3 mIU/mL in 2022, indicating good insulin sensitivity.
*   **HbA1c:**
    *   Measurement performed on the day of the current test; results to be updated in an upcoming video.

### Other Biomarkers

*   **C-reactive Protein (CRP):**
    *   Current Level: <0.3 mg/L (limit of sensitivity).
*   **Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV):**
    *   Current Level: 91.4 fL (considered age-expected).
    *   Goal: Reduce MCV in upcoming tests.
*   **Neutrophils:**
    *   Current Level: Less than 2,000 cells/µL (observed twice in the past three tests).
    *   Reference Range (Quest): 1,500 to 7,800 cells/µL.
    *   **Risk Association:** Levels less than 2,000 cells/µL are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk in a large epidemiological study.
    *   Action: Monitor closely and consider interventions to increase count above 2,000 cells/µL.
*   **Homocysteine:**
    *   Trend: Has been moving in the wrong direction for several tests.
    *   Intervention: Investigating the impact of methyl B12 supplementation and increased dietary choline (eggs) on homocysteine levels.
*   **DHEA Sulfate:**
    *   Trend: Has been age-expected and relatively low for many tests since last year.
    *   Monitoring: Progress in increasing DHEA sulfate levels.
*   **Testosterone:**
    *   Measured on this test.
    *   Analysis: To be assessed for age-expected and youthful/aged patterns in an upcoming video.
