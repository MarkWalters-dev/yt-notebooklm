# 2023-10-10 Did DunedinPACE Improve For Test 5 in 2023 Also Is NAD Significantly Correlated With DunedinPACE

## Executive Summary

*   The DunedinPACE score improved significantly between blood test 4 (0.98) and blood test 5 (0.75) in 2023, indicating a slowing of epigenetic aging relative to chronological aging.
*   The average DunedinPACE over the past three tests is 0.77, which would place the individual in the top nine of the rejuvenation Olympics for those with at least three tests over six months.
*   NAD levels were elevated (67 micromolar) on the same day as the higher DunedinPACE test (0.98), which was achieved after taking nicotinic acid.
*   NAD levels returned to baseline (22 micromolar) on the day of the improved DunedinPACE test (0.75), without precursor supplementation.
*   There is a significant positive correlation (0.97) between blood intracellular NAD levels and DunedinPACE, suggesting higher NAD levels may be associated with faster epigenetic aging.

## Blood Test Results and Analysis

### DunedinPACE Improvement for Test 5 (2023)

*   **Blood Test 4 (2023):** DunedinPACE was 0.98. This indicates that for every one year of chronological aging, there was 0.98 years of epigenetic aging. This score was noted as being in an undesirable direction for longevity goals.
*   **Blood Test 5 (August 21, 2023):** DunedinPACE was 0.75. This represents an improvement, indicating that for every one year of chronological aging, there was 0.75 years of epigenetic aging.
*   **Average DunedinPACE (Past 3 Tests):** Excluding the higher 0.98 score, the average DunedinPACE over the past three tests is 0.77. This average score would potentially place the individual in a tie for ninth place in the rejuvenation Olympics for individuals with at least three DunedinPACE scores over six months.

### NAD Levels and Correlation with DunedinPACE

*   **NAD Analysis (July 5, 2023):** On the same day as blood test 4 (DunedinPACE 0.98), NAD levels were measured at 67 micromolar by GINFINITY. This was a two to three-fold increase from the typical baseline of 20-25 micromolar and was achieved after taking nicotinic acid.
*   **NAD Analysis (August 21, 2023):** On the same day as blood test 5 (DunedinPACE 0.75), NAD levels returned to approximately 22 micromolar, the baseline level. No NAD precursors were taken prior to this test.
*   **Correlation Analysis:** With five data points where DunedinPACE and NAD were measured on the same day, a significant correlation was observed.
    *   Correlation Coefficient: 0.97
    *   P-value: < 0.05
*   **Interpretation of Correlation:** The data suggests a significant positive correlation between higher blood intracellular NAD levels and higher DunedinPACE. This indicates that elevated NAD levels may be associated with faster epigenetic aging.
*   **Potential Upper Limit for NAD:** It is hypothesized that an NAD level around 40 micromolar might be an upper limit to avoid negatively impacting DunedinPACE. Further testing is planned to explore potential optimal NAD ranges for mitochondrial and cellular function without adversely affecting epigenetic biomarkers.
