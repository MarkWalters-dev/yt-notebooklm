# 2021-01-30 Microbes Affect The Hallmarks Of Aging - Mitochondrial Dysfunction Part II

## Executive Summary

*   SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to increased mitochondrial DNA in the blood, particularly in individuals who died within 87 days of diagnosis, suggesting mitochondrial stress.
*   Plasma levels of mitochondrial DNA increase significantly with age, starting in the thirties and continuing into older age.
*   Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) seroprevalence increases with age across different populations (US, Poland, Greece), suggesting a higher viral burden in older individuals.
*   HSV-1 infection can induce mitochondrial stress, causing mitochondria to release their DNA into the cytosol, which can trigger antiviral gene expression.

## SARS-CoV-2 and Mitochondrial DNA

When SARS-CoV-2 enters cells, it manipulates mitochondria, leading to the ejection of mitochondrial DNA into the cytosol.

**Mitochondrial DNA in Blood Post-SARS-CoV-2 Infection:**

*   Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who died within an 87-day follow-up period showed higher levels of mitochondrial DNA (specifically for the cytochrome b gene, MT-CYTB) in their blood compared to those who survived.
*   This observation suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes mitochondrial stress, leading to increased mitochondrial DNA in circulation.

## Age-Related Increase in Plasma Mitochondrial DNA

Plasma levels of mitochondrial DNA are not normally present in significant amounts and their presence outside of mitochondria is indicative of cellular stress.

*   Mitochondrial DNA levels in plasma increase significantly with age, beginning around the thirties and continuing to rise up to approximately 100 years of age.

## Viral Burden and Aging: The Role of HSV-1

The age-related increase in circulating mitochondrial DNA may be linked to an increased viral burden, with Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) being a prominent candidate.

**HSV-1 Seroprevalence and Age:**

*   **United States (NHANES II & III):**
    *   Sample sizes: ~3,600 (NHANES II) and ~12,000 (NHANES III), totaling approximately 16,000 subjects.
    *   Seroprevalence of HSV-1 in blood increases with age, rising from 40-44% in 12-19 year olds to over 90% in 70-74 year olds.
*   **Poland:**
    *   Seroprevalence of HSV-1 increases with age, from approximately 75% in 15-19 year olds to over 99% in individuals older than 50.
*   **Greece:**
    *   Seroprevalence of HSV-1 in blood increases from 30-40% in infants (<1 year old) to almost 90% in individuals aged 50-60.

These findings across different countries consistently demonstrate an age-related increase in HSV-1 presence in the blood.

## HSV-1 Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction

HSV-1 infection can directly contribute to mitochondrial stress and the release of mitochondrial DNA.

**Mechanism of HSV-1 and Mitochondrial DNA Release:**

1.  **HSV-1 Infection:** Herpes simplex virus 1 infects cells.
2.  **Mitochondrial Stress:** This infection causes stress within the mitochondria.
3.  **Mitochondrial DNA Ejection:** As a response to stress, mitochondria release some of their DNA into the cytosol.
4.  **Intracellular Signaling:** Cytosolic mitochondrial DNA triggers an intracellular signaling cascade.
5.  **Nuclear Activation:** This cascade reaches the nucleus of the cell.
6.  **Antiviral Gene Expression:** The nucleus activates antiviral gene expression.
7.  **Inhibition of Viral Replication:** Resulting proteins inhibit viral replication.

This process provides a potential explanation for the increased levels of mitochondrial DNA observed in the blood during aging, especially in the context of an increased viral burden like that of HSV-1. While this is one example, other viruses and microbes may also contribute to age-related mitochondrial DNA increase.
