# 2020-07-17 Resting heart rate and heart rate variability - What's optimal

## Executive Summary

*   Resting heart rate around 45 beats per minute is associated with a maximally reduced all-cause mortality risk.
*   Heart rate variability, measured by RMSSD, declines significantly with age.
*   Lower heart rate variability is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death and all-cause mortality.
*   Higher heart rate variability than one's age group may be a promoter of longevity.
*   The speaker's personal data shows a decreasing resting heart rate and increasing heart rate variability over time, suggesting positive cardiovascular health trends.

## Resting Heart Rate and Mortality Risk

The relative risk for all-cause mortality is maximally reduced at a resting heart rate of approximately 45 beats per minute.

## Personal Resting Heart Rate Data

*   **Initial Period (August 2018 - June 2020):**
    *   Started with a resting heart rate around 52-53 bpm.
    *   Observed a trend of lower resting heart rate in winter and higher in summer.
    *   Summer increases were attributed to hay fever (allergies to grass and pollen).
    *   Improved symptom management in 2020 resulted in a less pronounced increase in resting heart rate during allergy season.
*   **2020 Data:** Average resting heart rate around 47-48 bpm, approaching optimal levels for mortality risk reduction.

## Published Literature on Resting Heart Rate

*   **Large Cohort Study (92,922 subjects):**
    *   Women: Green line.
    *   Men: Blue line.
    *   Data showed resting heart rate was lower in the summer and highest in the winter, contrasting with the speaker's personal data.
    *   This highlights the importance of comparing personal data to large epidemiological studies and investigating discrepancies.

## Resting Heart Rate and Aging

*   Resting heart rate generally increases during early life and then decreases towards the end of life.
*   Data from two studies show a peak in resting heart rate around age 50, followed by a decline.

## Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

### Definition and Measurement

*   **Definition:** Heart rate variability is the variation in the time interval between successive heartbeats.
*   **Metric Used:** The fitness tracker measures HRV using the RMSSD (root mean square of successive differences between heartbeats).

### HRV and Aging

*   **General Trend:** RMSSD (HRV) declines significantly with age.
    *   **Study 1 (260 subjects):** RMSSD decreased from approximately 53 ms in 10-19 year olds to 21 ms in 80-99 year olds.
    *   **Study 2 (344 subjects):** RMSSD decreased from approximately 53 ms in young adults/children to 19 ms in 70-79 year olds. Notably, an increase to 30 ms was observed in the 80-99 year old group in this study.
*   **Large Study (8,000,000 subjects - Fitbit users):**
    *   A potential "healthy user bias" exists due to the cohort being Fitbit users who may be more health-conscious.
    *   Younger Fitbit users (20-25 years old) showed higher RMSSD values (65-70s ms) compared to general population studies.
    *   HRV generally declines with age, from around 70 ms in youth to around 40 ms in 60-year-olds.

### HRV and Health Outcomes

*   **Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD):**
    *   Individuals with RMSSD scores less than 18 ms had an increased risk of SCD compared to those with RMSSD > 29 ms (12,500 subjects).
*   **All-Cause Mortality (ACM):**
    *   Increased ACM risk was associated with RMSSD values less than 8 ms.
*   **Conclusion:** Very low heart rate variability is associated with increased risk for sudden cardiac death and all-cause mortality. Higher RMSSD values are generally beneficial for cardiovascular health.

## Personal Heart Rate Variability Data

*   **Time Period:** Past 23 months.
*   **Trend:** Gradually increasing HRV with a significant spike during the winter of 2019-2020.
*   **Average RMSSD:**
    *   August - December 2018: 47.3 ms
    *   Full year 2019: 56.2 ms
    *   First six months of 2020: 61 ms
*   **Strategies for Improvement:**
    *   Better integration of rest.
    *   Avoiding overtraining.
    *   Monitoring workout intensity and duration.
*   **Comparison to Aging Data (Fitbit Users):**
    *   At age 45, the speaker's initial HRV (47.3 ms) was higher than the average Fitbit user's at a young age (around 38-40 ms).
    *   In 2019, the speaker's HRV was equivalent to that of a 30-year-old on the Fitbit user curve.
    *   In 2020, the speaker's HRV is equivalent to that of a 26-year-old, indicating a younger biological age.

## Conclusion of Personal Data Analysis

*   The speaker's data shows a **reduced resting heart rate** and an **increased heart rate variability** over time.
*   These trends suggest positive cardiovascular health improvements.
*   The combination of decreasing resting heart rate and increasing heart rate variability supports the argument against the speaker being on an age-related decline trajectory for resting heart rate. Instead, it indicates an optimization of cardiovascular metrics.
