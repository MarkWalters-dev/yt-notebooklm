# 2023-02-05 Quantifying Biological Age - Blood Test 1 in 2023

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age (PhenoAge) calculated at 33 years, 17 years younger than chronological age.
*   Biological age (Aging.ai) calculated at 28 years, 22 years younger than chronological age.
*   Daily glycine supplementation (2-4 grams/day for over 39 days) did not result in a reduction of homocysteine levels.
*   DHEA sulfate levels are low for biological age, leading to a hypothesis that low NAD/NADPH levels may limit the conversion of cholesterol to DHEA.
*   Albumin, globulin, and alkaline phosphatase levels, though sometimes flagged by Quest, are within ranges associated with lower all-cause mortality risk in large studies.

First blood test of 2023.

## Biological Age Metrics

### PhenoAge

Using Dr. Morgan Levine's phenotypic age calculator (PhenoAge) with nine component biomarkers and chronological age, the biological age is calculated at 33 years, which is 17 years younger than chronological age. For the eighth consecutive test, Quest's high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) measurement was less than 0.3 milligrams per liter.

Biological age trends since 2018:
*   **2018-2019 (3 tests):** Average PhenoAge was 36.1 years.
*   **2020-2021 (12 tests):** Average PhenoAge was 35.6 years.
*   **2022 (7 tests):** Average PhenoAge significantly reduced to 33.8 years.
*   **2023 (1st test):** Current PhenoAge is 33 years, which is lower than the 2022 average, indicating a good start for the year.

### Aging.ai

Using Aging.ai3.0 with 19 component biomarkers, the predicted biological age is 28 years, which is 22 years younger than chronological age.

Biological age trends since 2009:
*   **2009-2013 (3 tests over 5 years):** Average Aging.ai age was 32 years.
*   **2016-2022 (34 tests over 7 years):** Average Aging.ai age was 29.9 years.
*   **2023 (1st test):** Current Aging.ai age is 28 years.

Both PhenoAge and Aging.ai metrics show a positive trend in 2023.

## Detailed Biomarker Analysis

### Homocysteine

Homocysteine level was 10.8 micromolar. A hypothesis was previously made that glycine supplementation might reduce homocysteine.
*   **Glycine supplementation protocol:**
    *   Started December 15th.
    *   Dosage: At least 2 grams per day (some days 4 grams per day).
    *   Duration: At least 39 days prior to this blood test.
*   **Result:** Homocysteine increased from 10 to 10.8 micromolar, indicating no impact from glycine supplementation in this instance. Further strategies will be needed to reduce homocysteine.

### Albumin-to-Globulin Ratio

Quest flagged the albumin-to-globulin ratio at 2.6 as high.

*   **Albumin:** 4.9 g/dL. Optimal albumin for health and longevity is considered to be in the 4.6 to 4.8 g/dL range. The current level is just outside this range.
*   **Globulin:** 1.9 g/dL. Research on optimal globulin levels for aging is limited, but a study of over 12,000 people investigated the association between globulin and all-cause mortality (ACM) risk.
    *   **Reference Range:** Globulin levels of 2.8 to 3.0 g/dL were used as the reference.
    *   **Higher Levels:** Globulin levels higher than 3.3 g/dL were associated with a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk (Hazard Ratio = 1.47, indicating a 47% increased risk).
    *   **Lower Levels:** Globulin levels between 1.7 and 2.7 g/dL (where 1.9 falls) showed a Hazard Ratio of 1.19, but this association was not statistically significant as the confidence interval overlapped with one.
    *   **Conclusion:** The globulin level of 1.9 g/dL is not significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.

### Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)

Quest flagged alkaline phosphatase at 34 units per liter as outside the range. A study of over 8.9 million people examined the association between ALP and all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Findings:** A significantly increased all-cause mortality risk was observed only for ALP levels above 48 units per liter. For values less than 48, no significant association with increased all-cause mortality risk was found.
*   **Conclusion:** An ALP level of 34 U/L is not a concern, as it is below the threshold for significantly increased risk. This value may be an aberration, as typical levels are around 40 U/L, but consistently below 48 U/L.

### DHEA Sulfate and NAD/NADPH Hypothesis

DHEA sulfate level is low. While not flagged by Quest's reference range (61-442 micrograms per deciliter), it is low for a youthful biological age and is more indicative of chronological age.

The conversion of cholesterol to DHEA (the precursor to DHEA sulfate) requires NADPH.

**Metabolic Pathway for DHEA Synthesis:**
Cholesterol -> (5 enzymatic steps, each requiring NADPH) -> DHEA

NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) is essentially NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) with a phosphate group.

**Hypothesis:** Relatively low NAD (and thus NADPH) levels may be limiting the conversion of cholesterol into DHEA, consequently leading to low DHEA sulfate levels. Measuring NAD levels is the next step to investigate this hypothesis.
