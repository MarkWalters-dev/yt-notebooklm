# 2020-05-23 Lab Results Creatinine - What's Optimal For Health And Aging

## Executive Summary

*   Creatinine levels naturally increase with age, and this age-related increase is associated with higher all-cause mortality risk.
*   The optimal range for creatinine to minimize mortality risk appears to be narrower than the standard reference range, with the lowest risk observed around 0.8 mg/dL.
*   Both levels below and above this optimal range are associated with increased mortality risk.
*   Individual dietary choices, such as increased intake of eggs and cheese, can directly influence creatinine levels, potentially leading to undesirable increases.
*   Tracking daily diet alongside circulating biomarkers can help individuals identify dietary patterns that optimize their personal biomarker profile.

## Creatinine and Aging

Creatinine levels are known to increase with aging. This increase is linked to a higher risk of all-cause mortality. While visual data was not presented, multiple studies confirm this age-related rise in creatinine.

### Kidney Function (eGFR)

Creatinine is a key component in estimating kidney function through the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Data consistently shows that eGFR, as estimated by creatinine levels, declines with aging. This further supports the association between aging, increasing creatinine, and declining kidney health.

## Creatinine Levels and Mortality Risk

A study involving approximately 31,000 subjects investigated the relationship between creatinine levels and the risk of death from all causes.

*   The lowest mortality risk was observed at a creatinine level of approximately 0.8 mg/dL.
*   Creatinine levels below this optimal point showed an increase in mortality risk.
*   Creatinine levels above this optimal point also showed an increase in mortality risk.
*   A tighter range considered to reduce risk, even within the broader reference range, is 0.6 to 1.1 mg/dL.

## Individual Creatinine Tracking and Optimization

Personal tracking of creatinine levels can be used to identify individual optimal ranges and dietary influences.

### Personal Creatinine Trends

*   Average creatinine over eight measurements in the thirties was 1.11 mg/dL.
*   Over the past five years, efforts have been made to reduce this value, counteracting the typical age-related increase.
*   While individual data may show more variability, especially with less frequent tracking, more consistent tracking can lead to a tighter range of values.

### Dietary Influence on Creatinine

Detailed tracking of daily food intake, particularly over the past year and a half, has revealed specific dietary impacts on creatinine levels.

*   **Increased Egg and Cheese Intake:** In nine data points, an increase in the average daily intake of eggs and cheese correlated with an increase in creatinine levels. This suggests that factors like acid load or excessive animal protein from these foods may negatively impact creatinine levels.
*   **Reduced Egg and Cheese Intake:** Subsequently cutting back on egg and cheese consumption resulted in a decrease in creatinine levels, moving them in a more favorable direction.

## Biomarker Optimization Through Tracking

The process of tracking daily diet and circulating biomarkers allows for the identification of personalized dietary patterns that lead to an optimal biomarker profile.
