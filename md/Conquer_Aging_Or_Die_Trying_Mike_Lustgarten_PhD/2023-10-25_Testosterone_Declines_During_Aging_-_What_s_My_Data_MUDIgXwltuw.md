# 2023-10-25 Testosterone Declines During Aging - What s My Data

### Executive Summary

*   Testosterone levels consistently decline with age in men, as evidenced across multiple large-scale studies.
*   Studies show total testosterone peaks in the teenage years (around 30 nmol/L or 865 ng/dL) and can decline by approximately half by age 80 (around 435 ng/dL).
*   Morning testosterone measurements are crucial as levels are lower later in the day, and even when adjusted for covariates like BMI, the age-related decline persists.
*   An individual's total testosterone level of 746 ng/dL was observed to be significantly higher than the typical range expected for their chronological age (estimated around 550 ng/dL).

## Evidence for Age-Related Testosterone Decline

Testosterone levels decline during aging. This trend is supported by data from multiple studies conducted in men.

### Study 1: Early Adulthood Decline

*   **Participants:** Approximately 1,200 men, including 24-year-olds and 40-41-year-olds.
*   **Findings:** Total testosterone levels in 24-year-olds were approximately 650 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL). For 40-41-year-olds, levels were lower at approximately 580 ng/dL, indicating a decline in early adulthood.

### Study 2: Lifespan Decline

*   **Participants:** Approximately 2,500 men, spanning from birth through 80 years old.
*   **Findings:** Testosterone levels peaked in the teenage years at around 30 nanomolar (nmol/L), equivalent to approximately 865 ng/dL. Following this peak, an age-related decline was observed, resulting in 80-year-olds having about half that level, at approximately 435 ng/dL.

### Study 3: Morning Testosterone and Covariate Adjustment

*   **Participants:** Approximately 3,200 men, ranging from 25 years old to over 75 years old.
*   **Methodology Note:** This study measured morning testosterone, which is important because testosterone levels measured later in the day are typically lower than morning values. The reported concentrations were geometric means, adjusted for covariates such as age and BMI.
*   **Findings:** Despite adjustments, a clear age-related decline in testosterone levels was observed, with concentrations falling from approximately 18 nmol/L to about 15 nmol/L across the age range.

## Individual Total Testosterone Data

On October 9, 2023, an individual's total testosterone level was measured at 746 ng/dL. This level is above the range typically expected for their chronological age, which is estimated to be around 550 ng/dL (or 19 nmol/L). This places the observed level in a range often associated with younger individuals.
