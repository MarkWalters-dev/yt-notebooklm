# 2025-02-12 Visceral Fat Removal Extends Lifespan - Which Factors May Reduce Visceral Fat

## Executive Summary

*   Surgical removal of visceral fat in rats significantly extends both median and maximal lifespan.
*   Calorie restriction (40%) also extends lifespan and reduces visceral fat, suggesting that approximately 20% of its lifespan-extending effect may be due to visceral fat reduction.
*   In humans, higher Body Mass Index (BMI) is correlated with higher visceral fat mass, with a BMI in the 20-21 range associated with the lowest visceral fat levels.
*   Higher body fat percentage, as measured by DEXA, is also associated with increased visceral fat mass in both men and women.
*   Optimal body fat percentages for minimizing visceral fat are approximately 10-13% for men and 19-22% for women.

## Mouse Data: Visceral Fat Removal and Lifespan

*   Surgical removal of visceral fat in rats led to significant extensions in median and maximal lifespan.
    *   Median survival: The time at which 50% of the rats were still alive.
    *   Maximum survival: The time at which 20% of the rats were still alive (80% had died).
*   Rats undergoing visceral fat removal at five months of age exhibited significant lifespan extensions.

## Calorie Restriction and Visceral Fat

*   Calorie restriction (40% CR) is known to reduce visceral fat.
*   Calorie restriction also further extended median and maximal lifespan in rats.
*   The lifespan extension observed in rats with surgically removed visceral fat was approximately 20% relative to controls.
*   This suggests that approximately 20% of the lifespan-extending effect of calorie restriction is attributable to maintaining lower visceral fat levels.

## Human Evidence: Factors Associated with Lower Visceral Fat

### Body Mass Index (BMI)

*   Higher BMI is associated with higher levels of visceral fat in humans.
*   **Visceral Fat Mass (grams) vs. BMI:**
    *   As BMI increases from approximately 20, visceral fat mass also increases for both men and women.
*   **Optimal BMI for Lower Visceral Fat:**
    *   A BMI in the 20 to 21 range is associated with the lowest levels of visceral fat in both men and women.

### Body Fat Percentage (DEXA Measurement)

*   DEXA (Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry) is a precise method for measuring visceral fat.
*   Higher body fat percentage is associated with higher levels of visceral fat.
*   **Visceral Fat Mass (grams) vs. Body Fat Percentage:**
    *   **Men:** As body fat percentage increases from approximately 10%, visceral fat mass increases.
    *   **Women:** Visceral fat mass initially declines slightly in the low teens to low twenties of body fat percentage, then increases for those with body fat percentage greater than approximately 22%.
*   **Optimal Body Fat Percentage for Lower Visceral Fat:**
    *   **Men:** 10% to 13% body fat range.
    *   **Women:** 19% to 22% range.

## Personal DEXA Data and Variability

*   **December 2023:**
    *   Visceral Fat Mass: 0.58 pounds (263 grams)
    *   BMI: 22.2
    *   Body Fat Percentage: 14%
*   **December 2024 (Two scans on the same day):**
    *   **Scan 1:** Visceral Fat Mass: 0.8 pounds (estimated 363 grams - calculation based on 30-36% difference)
    *   **Scan 2:** Visceral Fat Mass: 0.59 pounds (303 grams - calculation based on 30-36% difference)
    *   BMI: 22.3
    *   Body Fat Percentage (Scan 1): 15.7%
    *   Body Fat Percentage (Scan 2): 15.2%
*   **Average Visceral Fat Mass (2024 scans):** Approximately 0.7 pounds (316 grams).
*   **Variability in DEXA Measurements:**
    *   Visceral fat mass measurements showed a significant test-to-test variability (approximately 36% difference between the two 2024 scans).
    *   Whole body body fat percentage measurements showed much lower variability.
*   **Comparison to Age-Expected Data (Men, Age 52):**
    *   Median visceral fat mass for age 52 is approximately 1300 grams.
    *   The author's average visceral fat mass (316 grams) is significantly lower, aligning with the median for individuals aged 20-30.
*   **Trend Observation:** While the 2024 average (316 grams) is higher than 2023 (263 grams), the test-to-test variability makes it uncertain if there has been a true increase. Annual measurement is planned to monitor this trend.

## Goal for Longevity

*   The primary goal for maximizing longevity is to keep visceral fat mass as low as possible and avoid age-related increases.
