# 2021-10-16 Chocolate Intake Is Associated With Reduced All-Cause And Cause-Specific Mortality Risk

## Executive Summary

*   Chocolate consumption, particularly moderate amounts, is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality.
*   Specific types of chocolate (dark, not white) have been linked to improved insulin sensitivity and reduced blood pressure in randomized controlled trials.
*   The polyphenol epicatechin, abundant in dark chocolate and cocoa powder, has demonstrated lifespan-extending effects in mice.
*   Healthy user bias is unlikely to fully explain the observed associations, as chocolate consumers exhibited less healthy lifestyle metrics in some areas.
*   Personalized data suggests a daily intake of 12-19 grams of cocoa beans may be optimal for systemic health biomarkers.

## Human Evidence: Observational Study Findings

### All-Cause Mortality Risk

*   **Definition of a Serving:** Less than one average bar or less than one ounce (approximately 28 grams).
*   **Statistical Significance:** Hazard ratio of 1 is the reference point. 95% confidence intervals completely below 1 indicate statistical significance.

**Non-Smokers:**
*   The lowest all-cause mortality risk was observed with approximately half a serving (around 18 grams) of chocolate per week.
*   All chocolate intakes, from one up to eight or more servings per week, were associated with a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality risk when compared to no chocolate intake.

**Smokers (Current or Former):**
*   A less pronounced effect was observed, with an 8-9% decreased all-cause mortality risk.
*   Significance was noted for one serving of chocolate per week compared to no servings.
*   Higher intakes of chocolate were not associated with further reductions in all-cause mortality risk in this group.

### Cause-Specific Mortality Risk

**Cardiovascular Disease Mortality:**
*   All chocolate intakes above zero servings per week were associated with a significantly reduced cardiovascular disease mortality risk, regardless of the adjustment model.

**Alzheimer's Disease Mortality:**
*   Half a serving up to two servings per week was associated with a significantly reduced Alzheimer's disease mortality risk compared to no chocolate intake.
*   For intakes greater than two servings per week, the fully adjusted model (model three) showed a statistically significant reduction, although less adjusted models did not.
*   Up to half a serving per week was not significantly different from no chocolate intake.

**Other Mortality Causes:**
*   Cancer, cerebrovascular, and respiratory mortality were not significantly associated with any level of chocolate intake.

### Assessing Healthy User Bias

*   The study examined metrics related to healthy user bias: physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, and added sugar intake.
*   **Findings:**
    *   Individuals consuming no chocolate had *higher* levels of physical activity and fruit/vegetable intake compared to those consuming higher amounts of chocolate.
    *   Individuals consuming no chocolate had *lower* added sugar intake compared to those consuming more than two servings of chocolate per week (who had almost double the intake).
*   **Conclusion:** Healthy user bias is unlikely to be the sole explanation for the observed associations, as chocolate consumers showed less healthy lifestyle metrics in certain areas.

## Human Evidence: Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) Findings

### Study Design

*   **Comparison:** 100 grams/day of dark chocolate vs. 90 grams/day of white chocolate.
*   **Participants:** 15 young, normal-weight subjects (average age 34, BMI 23).
*   **Duration:** 15 days.
*   **White Chocolate Note:** Contains cocoa butter but lacks cocoa solids, which are rich in polyphenols.

### Effects on Insulin Sensitivity

*   **Metric:** Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA IR). Lower HOMA IR indicates greater insulin sensitivity.
*   **Dark Chocolate Group:** Showed a reduction in HOMA IR, indicating improved insulin sensitivity.
*   **White Chocolate Group:** Did not show a reduction in HOMA IR, indicating no improvement in insulin sensitivity.

### Effects on Blood Pressure

*   **Metric:** Systolic blood pressure.
*   **Dark Chocolate Group:** Demonstrated a reduction in blood pressure.
*   **White Chocolate Group:** Did not show a reduction in blood pressure.

## Potential Mechanisms: The Role of Epicatechin

*   **Key Compound:** Epicatechin, a polyphenol found in chocolate.
*   **Evidence in Mice:**
    *   Administration of epicatechin to old mice extended lifespan.
    *   After 37 weeks, 70% of epicatechin-supplemented mice were alive, compared to 39% of old controls.
    *   Even 7 weeks after the 37-week study, 44% of epicatechin mice remained alive.

### Epicatechin Content in Different Chocolate Types (mg per 100g)

*   **White Chocolate:** 0 mg
*   **Milk Chocolate:** 11 mg
*   **Dark Chocolate:** 42 - 84 mg
*   **Bittersweet/Baking Chocolate:** 143 mg
*   **Cocoa Powder:** 196 mg

## Personalized Data: N-of-One Analysis of Cocoa Bean Intake

*   **Data Source:** Over three years of daily dietary tracking and 17 corresponding blood tests.
*   **Biomarkers Assessed:** 22 systemic health biomarkers (glucose, liver function, kidney function, lipoproteins, immune cells, inflammation markers, biological age scores).

### Correlation with Cocoa Bean Intake

**Biomarkers Going in the Right Direction (Improved Health):**
*   Lower Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) - liver enzyme.
*   Higher Red Blood Cell count.
*   Lower Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) - red blood cell size.

**Biomarkers Going in the Wrong Direction (Potentially Detrimental):**
*   Lower Percentage of Lymphocytes (a decline in lymphocytes occurs with aging).

### Statistical Analysis and Interpretation

*   **Nominal p-values:** Showed a net positive score (3 biomarkers improving, 1 potentially worsening).
*   **Adjusted p-values (Benjamini-Hochberg):** Adjusted p-values ranged from 0.17 to 0.20, indicating an 80-83% chance these correlations are not false positives.
*   **Net Score Interpretation:**
    *   **Best Case:** Net +3 (lymphocyte percentage is a false positive).
    *   **Worst Case:** Net +1 (2 improving, 1 worsening).
*   **Conclusion:** Cocoa bean intake is significantly correlated with a better-than-average effect on systemic biomarkers.

### Optimal Intake Recommendation (Personalized)

*   **Average Daily Cocoa Bean Intake:** 12 grams.
*   **Range:** 1 gram to 19 grams per day.
*   **Recommendation based on Positive Net Score:** Consume somewhere between the average intake (12 grams) and the highest intake (19 grams) of cocoa beans per day. This contrasts with the observational study suggesting around 18 grams of *chocolate* per *week*.
