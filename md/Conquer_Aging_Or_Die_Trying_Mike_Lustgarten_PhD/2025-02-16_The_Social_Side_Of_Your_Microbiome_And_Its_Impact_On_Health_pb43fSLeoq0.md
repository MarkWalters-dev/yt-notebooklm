# 2025-02-16 The Social Side Of Your Microbiome And Its Impact On Health

## Executive Summary
*   Microbial exchange between individuals and with the environment is a fundamental driver of microbiome composition, shaping social behaviors and health outcomes.
*   Physical and social interactions, from grooming to kissing, are crucial for microbial transmission and can influence the health of the host.
*   The built environment, including factors like moisture, surface materials, and occupants, plays a significant role in determining the local microbiome.
*   Exposure to diverse microbial environments, such as farms and forests, can train the immune system and reduce the risk of inflammatory diseases like asthma.
*   Reintroducing microbial diversity through elements like houseplants, animals, and connection with natural environments is vital for modern health.

## The Microbial World and Sociality

*   We are constantly exposed to microorganisms from our environment, with our immune system acting as a curator, promoting beneficial microbes and suppressing harmful ones.
*   Microorganisms have existed for billions of years longer than humans, evolving in a rich microbial world.
*   Our bodies emit millions of bacterial cells per hour, contributing to the microbiome of our built environments.
*   Our immune system manages microbial communities on our skin, in our respiratory tract, and in our gut, acting as a gardener rather than an army.

## Sources of Microorganisms and Social Transmission

*   Microorganisms are acquired from the environment, particularly during birth and childhood.
*   Physical and social interactions between people are significant sources of microbial exchange.
*   Babies receive microbes from their mothers and fathers, and from anyone they interact with, which is vital for microbiome development.
*   Social behaviors like grooming, co-feeding, kissing, and nursing likely evolved to promote microbial transmission.
*   Even clinical practices like Fecal Microbiome Transplant (FMT) highlight the deliberate transfer of beneficial microorganisms between individuals.

## Evidence for Social Microbial Transmission

### Baboon Study
*   A 14-year study of nearly 600 baboons analyzed 16,000 fecal samples.
*   **Finding:** 97% of bacteria in baboons were associated with social interactions, primarily familial connections.
*   Shared bacteria were predominantly involved in fermenting dietary fiber and producing beneficial health products.
*   The abundance of these shared bacteria was predicted by social group behaviors, such as grooming.

### Human Household Study
*   A study in a household with adults and dogs demonstrated microbial transfer between humans and animals, and across surfaces.
*   **Finding:** Couples with a dog in their home shared more microbial similarity than couples without a dog or even couples with a baby.
*   Dogs act as significant microbial transfer vectors between people.
*   People in the same household typically share about 12% of their gut microbial community.

### Lodger Study
*   A study of a young couple sharing an apartment with a lodger revealed distinct microbial communities.
*   **Finding:** The couple (blue and red samples) were more microbially similar to each other than to the lodger (person three), especially in samples from hands and feet.
*   The nasal cavity remained unique across individuals, likely due to limited physical interaction.
*   Physical interaction with other humans is the primary driver of microbial similarity within a household.

## Pathogens and Transmission Pathways

*   Pathogens have evolved to exploit the same transmission pathways used by beneficial microorganisms.
*   Viruses, bacteria, and fungi are transmitted through breathing into the built environment and by contact with skin.
*   During the COVID-19 pandemic, airborne transmission was shown to be more significant than surface transmission.
*   Understanding microbial communities in the built environment is crucial for epidemiology.

## The Built Environment and Microbial Colonization

### Hospital Environment Study
*   A study tracked the microbial community of a new hospital building before and after it became operational.
*   **Finding:** The hospital environment became more similar to humans, with microbial communities influenced by how staff interacted within the space.
*   Staff transmitted bacteria (e.g., *Staphylococcus*, *Corynebacterium*, *Acinetobacter*) to patients primarily through their hands.
*   Limited transmission of bacteria from patients back to staff was observed, likely due to consistent handwashing.
*   Handwashing is highlighted as a crucial intervention.

### College Dormitory Study
*   Microbial transmission networks in a college dormitory were analyzed.
*   **Finding:** The social dynamics of the dormitory were revealed through microbial interactions, primarily driven by hand-to-hand transmission.

## The "Sterile Polluted World" and Health

*   Modern lifestyles in built environments often involve polluted air, social inequity, and chemical cleaning, leading to limited microbial diversity exposure.
*   This lack of exposure contrasts with rural communities that interact with animals and plants in cleaner air.

### Amish vs. Hutterite Study (Asthma Rates)
*   **Amish Community (Pennsylvania/Indiana):** Live on family farms, children interact with farming environments from a young age.
    *   **Finding:** Very low rates of asthma (around 4% of the population).
*   **Hutterite Community (South Dakota):** Live in housing communities separate from farms; children under 14 do not interact with the farming environment.
    *   **Finding:** Significantly higher rates of asthma (around 25% of the population), despite similar genetic predispositions.
*   **Conclusion:** Early-life exposure to diverse farming environments appears to protect against asthma.

### Immune System Differences
*   **Neutrophils:** Sentinel cells that detect and signal foreign objects. Higher numbers are needed with increased exposure to foreign objects (e.g., farm dust).
*   **Eosinophils:** Pro-inflammatory response cells associated with asthma. Hutterites have more eosinophils.
*   **Cell Surface Markers (CXCR4, CD11b/c):** Higher on neutrophils of Hutterites, making them "sticky" and potentially leading to inflammatory responses when older and unused.
*   **Mouse Study:**
    *   Mice sensitized to albumin showed increased eosinophils in lungs.
    *   Exposure to dust from Amish bedrooms significantly reduced this inflammatory reaction when subsequently exposed to albumin.
    *   Hutterite dust did not have the same protective effect.
*   **Finding:** Bacterial and fungal antigens in farm dust likely help reduce asthma-like inflammatory responses.
*   **Statistic:** Children growing up on farms in the US have a ~50% reduction in the likelihood of developing asthma.

## Reintroducing Nature into Urban Environments

*   **Trees:** Offer benefits beyond aesthetics, including supporting a rich microbial environment that can stimulate the immune system.
*   **Finnish Preschool Study:** Children interacting with forest soil showed reduced inflammation and healthier immune systems compared to those who did not.
*   **COMETS Cohort (University of Washington):** Investigating the role of outdoor time and farm/forest schools in children's development of inflammatory responses and cardiometabolic disease risk.
*   **Goal:** "Rewilding" our lives by developing microbial building materials, living walls, and increasing ventilation.
*   **Multigenerational Living:** Encourages social interaction and microbial exchange.
    *   **Finding:** Infants with older siblings may have higher proportions of *Lactobacillus*, potentially due to older siblings bringing microbes from the wider world into the home.
*   **Public Art Projects:** Incorporating bacteria into ceramic surfaces to stimulate immune systems through physical interaction.

## The Role of Specific Environments and Habits

### Lighting
*   Direct sunlight exposure, even through a window, can alter microbial communities.
*   However, the impact of artificial lighting (LEDs vs. incandescent) on the microbiome is minimal compared to other factors.
*   **Primary Drivers of Surface Microbiome:** Occupants (humans and animals), plants, surface materials, temperature, and humidity.

### Moisture and Humidity
*   **Moisture is essential for microbial growth.**
*   High humidity (above 45%) can promote mold growth, which can be detrimental to health.
*   While moisture can be problematic, beneficial fungi also exist. Research is ongoing to create living structures that support beneficial microbes while preventing harmful ones.

### Diet and Fiber
*   **Soluble Fiber:** Can improve survival in mice infected with influenza by increasing short-chain fatty acid production and altering immune responses.
*   **Gut-Lung Axis:** Interactions between the gut microbiome and the lungs are crucial, with diet playing a role.
*   **Microparticle Pollution:** Some studies suggest soluble fiber may protect against microparticle pollution by improving lung function.
*   **Particulate Matter (PM2.5, PM10):** These are damaging to health, and their levels are expected to increase due to factors like global warming and fires. A healthy diet and microbiome can increase resilience, but there are thresholds beyond which environmental damage cannot be overcome.

## Soil Health and Microbiome

*   Approximately 50% of agricultural soils are nutrient and microbially depleted, projected to rise to 90% by 2050.
*   **Soil Health Center at UCSD:** Aims to reintroduce beneficial microorganisms into soils to restore carbon and nitrogen cycles, enhance resilience to climate change, and improve food security.
*   **Composting:** Beneficial, but not always feasible in resource-limited regions.
*   **Synthetic Probiotic Communities:** Developing constructed microbial communities for soil application.
*   **Prebiotic in Soil:** Plants excrete carbon exudates from their roots, which feed soil bacteria. This creates a symbiotic relationship between plants and soil microbiomes.
*   **Synthetic Nitrogen Fertilizers:** Can harm soil microbiomes by making them dependent on artificial inputs and reducing interaction with plants.
*   **Soil Microbiome Diversity:** Is significantly more diverse than the human gut microbiome and is essential for ecosystem health.

## Key Microbial Species and Their Importance

### Bifidobacterium longum infantis
*   This bacteria specializes in consuming breast milk sugars (oligosaccharides).
*   Its prevalence has drastically declined, likely due to multigenerational antibiotic use and poor diet.
*   This decline can hinder proper digestion of breast milk, leading to a loss of associated benefits.
*   **Intervention:** Introducing *B. longum infantis* into infant diets, particularly in neonatal intensive care units, is being explored.
*   **Prebiotic:** Breast milk sugars are the primary prebiotic for *B. longum infantis*.

### Lactobacillus Species
*   Certain *Lactobacillus* species isolated from the lung can be effective in treating conditions like COPD.
*   Transfer from the gut to the lung via esophageal transfer is a potential pathway.
*   Diet may influence the presence and function of these species.

## Future and Current Projects

*   **Women's Health:** Modifying the gut and vaginal/cervical microbiome to reduce female-associated diseases, improve menopausal symptoms, and support healthy aging.
*   **Gut-Brain Axis:** Clinical trials are underway to reduce depression and anxiety by altering the gut microbiome with specific probiotics.
    *   **Key Finding:** Even dead bacteria, or their chemical components, can interact with the immune system to influence brain function. This is because the immune system recognizes chemical signatures (e.g., lipopolysaccharides, flagellin) on or from bacteria, not necessarily the live organism.
*   **Fecal pH and Metabolic Activity:**
    *   Fecal pH is a proxy for the oxidative environment of the microbiome.
    *   While pH fluctuations are small (<1 point), they impact microbial metabolic activity.
    *   A healthy diet and microbiome can increase antioxidant capacity and reduce oxidative stress, making the body more resilient.
    *   There is potential for certain gut bacteria to produce neurotoxic compounds (e.g., quinoline 8) that are sensitive to fecal pH.
*   **Longitudinal Studies:** There is a critical need for long-term studies to understand the impact of interventions on longevity and healthy aging.

## The Social Aspect of Health and Wellbeing

*   **Choosing Friends Wisely:** Exposure to healthier friends can positively influence one's own microbiome and habits.
*   **Home Environment:** Bringing elements of nature indoors, such as houseplants and pets, can provide beneficial microbial exposure.
*   **Outdoor Access:** Spending time in natural environments like forests and farms is crucial for immune system development and overall health.
*   **Air Quality:** While air purification is important, it should not eliminate beneficial microbial exposure. A balance is needed.
*   **Humidity Control:** Maintaining humidity below 45% is generally recommended to prevent excessive mold growth.
*   **Diversity is Strength:** Embracing microbial diversity in our environments and lives is key to resilience and health.
