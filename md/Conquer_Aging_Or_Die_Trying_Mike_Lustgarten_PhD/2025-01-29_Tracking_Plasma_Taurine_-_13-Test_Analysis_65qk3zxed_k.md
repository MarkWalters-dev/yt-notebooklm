# 2025-01-29 Tracking Plasma Taurine - 13-Test Analysis

## Executive Summary
*   Plasma taurine levels in the presenter declined from an average of $113 \text{ } \mu\text{M}$ in 2023 to $127 \text{ } \mu\text{M}$ in 2024 across eight tests, showing a slight year-over-year increase despite expected age-related decline.
*   Age-related data suggests plasma taurine levels typically decline with age, with an expected average level for the presenter's age being around $80 \text{ } \mu\text{M}$.
*   A significant inverse correlation was found between average daily fructose intake and plasma taurine levels across 13 tracked tests ($p < 0.05$).
*   Protein intake showed no significant correlation with plasma taurine levels over the 13-test period.
*   Individuals younger than 20 years showed peak average plasma taurine levels approaching $200 \text{ } \mu\text{M}$.

## Taurine Background
Taurine is implicated in several areas of health, including:
*   Promoting mitochondrial health.
*   Improving glucose homeostasis.
*   Increasing muscle endurance.

The primary assumption is that increased dietary taurine leads to increased plasma levels, which are trackable and potentially optimizable.

## Plasma Taurine Data Tracking (13 Tests)
Plasma taurine levels were tracked using an at-home metabolomics kit measuring over 600 metabolites.

| Period | Number of Tests | Average Plasma Taurine (Millimolar) | Average Plasma Taurine ($\mu\text{M}$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2023 | 5 | $0.113 \text{ mM}$ | $113 \text{ } \mu\text{M}$ |
| 2024 (to date) | 8 | N/A | $127 \text{ } \mu\text{M}$ |

### Comparison to Age-Expected Levels
*   Observed age-related data shows plasma taurine levels decline with aging, at least up to 60 years of age.
*   Based on the observed trend line, the expected average plasma taurine level for the presenter's chronological age is approximately $80 \text{ } \mu\text{M}$.
*   The presenter's levels ($113 \text{ } \mu\text{M}$ to $127 \text{ } \mu\text{M}$) suggest physiological levels equivalent to being approximately 20 years younger.
*   Younger individuals (under 20 years) exhibit the highest levels, averaging near $200 \text{ } \mu\text{M}$.

## Dietary Tracking Methodology
The approach uses comprehensive tracking to correlate dietary intake with biomarker changes over time.

**Data Collection Protocol:**
1.  Track all food intake since 2015 using a food scale, as dining out is rare.
2.  Enter detailed food data (macros and micronutrients) into a diet tracking application (e.g., Cronometer).
3.  Manually export this data into a spreadsheet for correlation analysis.
4.  For each blood test, the corresponding data represents the average dietary intake for the preceding period (e.g., 50 days prior to a test).
5.  Calculate correlations between tracked dietary factors and corresponding biomarker results (plasma taurine).

**Data Sufficiency:**
*   Two tests are insufficient for meaningful conclusions.
*   Three tests allow for preliminary correlation analysis, though noise is expected. More tests reduce noise, strengthening the signal.

## Dietary Correlations with Plasma Taurine (N=13 Tests)
A total of 86 comparisons were made between plasma taurine (measured via iolo metabolomics) and dietary factors.

| Dietary Factor | Correlation Result | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Protein Intake | Not significantly correlated | $p > 0.05$ |
| Fructose Intake | Inverse Correlation (Higher Fructose $\rightarrow$ Lower Taurine) | $p < 0.05$ |

### Fructose Inverse Correlation Analysis
The data plots plasma taurine levels against the corresponding average daily fructose intake:
*   A significant inverse correlation is observed, suggesting higher average daily fructose intake corresponds to lower plasma taurine.
*   The fructose intake measured originated almost exclusively from whole foods (fruits, vegetables), as cheat days are limited to only a few days post-test.

**Future Investigation Plan:**
*   One data point showed a high fructose intake of $48 \text{ grams/day}$ potentially influencing the trend.
*   Future testing will target average daily fructose intakes in the $50 \text{ to } 55 \text{ gram}$ range to confirm if the correlation strengthens or weakens across this region of the plot.
*   The goal for future monitoring is to achieve this target range while maintaining high plasma taurine to resist age-related decline.

### Test 14 Preliminary Data Point
*   For the 52-day period preceding Test 14 (December 17 test), the average daily fructose intake was $61.5 \text{ grams/day}$.
*   Extrapolation based on the established curve suggested a resulting plasma taurine level near $100 \text{ } \mu\text{M}$. The results for Test 14 and associated diet correlations are being released on Patreon.

## Optimization Strategy
Supplementation is considered a secondary approach; dietary optimization is preferred first. The immediate goal is to avoid the observed age-related decline in taurine levels.
