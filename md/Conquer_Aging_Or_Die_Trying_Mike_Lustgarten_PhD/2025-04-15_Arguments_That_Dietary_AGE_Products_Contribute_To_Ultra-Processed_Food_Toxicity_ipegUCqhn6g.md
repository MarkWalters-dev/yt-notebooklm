# 2025-04-15 Arguments That Dietary AGE Products Contribute To Ultra-Processed Food Toxicity

**Executive Summary:**
*   Dietary Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs) are formed during thermal food processing and are structurally and physiologically indistinguishable from endogenous AGEs.
*   AGEs, such as Nε-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), are documented to cause tissue injuries across almost all cell systems and tissues.
*   Orally administered labeled AGEs are absorbed into human circulation, with a portion remaining in circulation and tissues, while the majority is eliminated in urine.
*   Studies in mouse models demonstrate that diets rich in AGEs lead to the development of insulin resistance, which can be prevented by a diet low in AGEs.
*   In humans, an AGE-rich diet increases markers of inflammation and insulin resistance in healthy subjects, while a low-AGE diet can reverse these markers in patients with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes.

## Nature and Impact of Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs)

### Formation and Origin
AGEs and other major reaction products are generated in food during thermal processing. These dietary AGEs are structurally and physiologically indistinguishable from their endogenous counterparts produced within the body.

### Biological Effects
AGEs, specifically Nε-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), have been documented to produce tissue injuries in almost all cell systems and tissues. Given their indistinguishability from endogenous AGEs, the body cannot differentiate between internal and external sources of these compounds.

## Dietary AGEs: Absorption, Metabolism, and Health Effects

### Absorption and Distribution in Humans
Oral administration of labeled AGEs in human studies has shown that they are absorbed into circulation. While mostly eliminated in the urine, some AGEs remain in circulation and tissues.

### Evidence from Mouse Models
Diets loaded with AGEs in different mouse models lead to the development of insulin resistance. This insulin resistance can be prevented by diets engineered to be low in AGEs.

### Evidence from Human Studies
*   **Healthy Subjects:** Healthy human subjects exposed to an AGE-rich diet show an increase in markers of inflammation and insulin resistance.
*   **Patients with Metabolic Disorders:** Patients with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes exposed to a low-AGE diet demonstrate a reversal of markers of inflammation and insulin resistance.
