# 2021-06-15 Selenium - How Much Is Optimal For Health

## Executive Summary
*   Mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), contributes to aging.
*   The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for selenium (55 mcg/day) is based solely on maximizing glutathione peroxidase activity, not overall health.
*   Studies suggest that optimal dietary selenium intake for reducing all-cause mortality risk is higher than the RDA, ranging from 125-183 mcg/day.
*   Circulating selenium levels of approximately 1.3 µmol/L (corresponding to ~103 µg/L) are associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk.
*   Supplementation at 300 mcg/day of selenium for five years significantly increased all-cause mortality risk over a 15-year follow-up, indicating a potential upper limit.

## Mitochondrial Function and Aging

Normal mitochondrial function produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). These ROS can damage proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. This dysfunction creates a vicious cycle of increased ROS production, further damage, and decreased mitochondrial function, contributing to the aging process. Mitochondrial dysfunction is recognized as one of the nine hallmarks of aging. Minimizing excess H₂O₂, rather than eliminating it, is crucial for interrupting this cycle.

## Hydrogen Peroxide Degradation

Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) is degraded through a mechanism involving glutathione (GSH). Two molecules of GSH are oxidized to one molecule of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) while reducing H₂O₂ to water. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GPx). The activity of GPx is dependent on selenium. Insufficient selenium intake leads to suboptimal GPx activity, allowing H₂O₂ levels to accumulate.

## Selenium and Selenoproteins

Selenium intake influences the levels of various selenoproteins, which are proteins requiring selenium for their function. These include:
*   Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx)
*   Thioredoxin Reductase (TXNRD)
*   Deiodinases (DIO)
*   Selenoprotein P
*   Other selenium-dependent proteins

The collective functions of these selenoproteins are involved in:
*   Immune function
*   Thyroid function
*   Protection against oxidative stress
*   Modulation of inflammatory signaling pathways
*   Reduction of all-cause mortality risk

## Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for Selenium

The current RDA for selenium for adults over 19 is 55 micrograms (mcg) per day. Slightly higher recommendations are made for pregnant (60 mcg/day) and breastfeeding (70 mcg/day) women. These recommendations were primarily established based on the selenium intake required to maximize the activity of glutathione peroxidase as an H₂O₂ degrading enzyme.

## Optimal Selenium Intake for Health

### Dietary Intake and All-Cause Mortality

Studies suggest that the RDA of 55 mcg/day may not be optimal for overall health, particularly regarding all-cause mortality.
*   **Study 1 (18,000 participants):** Lowest all-cause mortality risk was observed at a dietary selenium intake of 125 mcg/day, exceeding the RDA.
*   **Study 2 (19,000 participants):**
    *   Highest all-cause mortality risk was in groups averaging 71 mcg/day.
    *   Lower all-cause mortality was seen in groups with higher intakes (100-126 mcg/day).
    *   The lowest all-cause mortality was associated with an average intake of 183 mcg/day.

### Circulating Selenium Levels and All-Cause Mortality

Circulating selenium levels are considered a more objective measure of selenium intake than dietary recall.
*   **Meta-analysis (6 studies, 21,000 subjects):** The lowest all-cause mortality risk was associated with a circulating selenium concentration of 1.3 micromoles (µmol)/L.
    *   Converting to micrograms per liter (µg/L): 1.3 µmol/L * 79 g/mol = 103 µg/L.
*   **Correlation between dietary and serum selenium:** Higher dietary selenium intake is correlated with higher circulating selenium levels. Extrapolation from this correlation suggests that a circulating level of 103 µg/L corresponds to a dietary intake of approximately 166 mcg/day.

These findings from circulating selenium levels align with the ranges identified in dietary studies (125-183 mcg/day) for optimal health outcomes.

## Upper Limit of Selenium Intake

### Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) Data

A five-year RCT investigated the effects of selenium supplementation at 100, 200, or 300 mcg/day, alongside a placebo.
*   **During the 5-year study:** No statistically significant differences in all-cause mortality were observed between the groups.
*   **Over a subsequent 10-year follow-up (15-year total):** The group supplemented with 300 mcg/day of selenium showed a significantly *increased* all-cause mortality risk compared to the placebo group.
*   **Interpretation:** This suggests that chronic selenium intake of 300 mcg/day may induce toxicity, leading to increased mortality risk. Data indicates that 200 mcg/day might be an upper limit, with 300 mcg/day being potentially harmful.

### Personal Biomarker Data

Analysis of personal dietary tracking and blood tests (since 2015) suggests that selenium intakes exceeding 200 mcg/day are correlated with adverse changes in several biomarkers:
*   **Uric Acid:** Higher selenium intake (>200 mcg/day) correlated with increased uric acid levels, which are associated with aging and increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW):** Higher selenium intake correlated with increased RDW, a marker typically lower in youth and associated with lower all-cause mortality.
*   **HDL Cholesterol:** Higher selenium intake (>200 mcg/day) correlated with lower HDL levels.
*   **Alkaline Phosphatase:** Higher selenium intake correlated with increased alkaline phosphatase, which rises with age and is linked to increased all-cause mortality.

Conversely, selenium intake above 200 mcg/day showed a correlation with *decreasing* glucose levels, which is generally considered a positive effect as elevated glucose is linked to aging and mortality.

Out of 28 biomarkers analyzed, four showed negative trends with higher selenium intake (>200 mcg/day), one showed a positive trend (glucose), and 23 showed no significant correlation. This "net minus three" suggests that very high selenium levels may not be optimal for health.

## Selenium-Rich Foods

*   **Brazil Nuts:** The richest dietary source. Approximately 1 gram of Brazil nuts contains 19 mcg of selenium.
*   **Sardines:** A good source of selenium. 80 grams of sardines provide about 40 mcg of selenium.

To stay below the potential upper limit of 200 mcg/day, the author consumes about 96 mcg from one large Brazil nut (5g) and 40 mcg from sardines (80g), totaling approximately 180-190 mcg/day.
