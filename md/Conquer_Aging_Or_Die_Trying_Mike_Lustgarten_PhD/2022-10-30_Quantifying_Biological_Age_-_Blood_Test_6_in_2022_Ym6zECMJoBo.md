# 2022-10-30 Quantifying Biological Age - Blood Test 6 in 2022

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age, calculated using the Levine Phenotypic Age metric from the sixth blood test in 2022, was 34.5 years, representing a 15.2-year reduction compared to chronological age.
*   A statistically significant reduction in Levine's biological age was observed in 2022 (average 34.0 years) compared to 2020-2021 data (average 35.6 years) (p=0.04).
*   The average chronological age minus biological age reduction improved to 15.3 years for the first six tests in 2022, a further reduction compared to the approximately 12-year average from 2018-2021.
*   Using the aging.ai 3.0 calculator, the predicted biological age from the latest test was 33 years, which is 16.7 years younger than chronological age.
*   Aging.ai biological age has consistently ranged from 29 to 32 years since 2009, demonstrating stability over time regardless of chronological age progression.

## Introduction: Tracking Biological Age

The premise is that aging and disease are biochemical processes occurring over decades. Tracking and optimizing established biomarkers of organ and systemic health may slow these processes. This report details results from the sixth blood test in 2022, focusing on biological age.

## Levine Phenotypic Age

Using Dr. Morgan Levine's phenotypic age calculator, a metric of biological age, the biological age was 34.5 years, which is 15.2 years younger than chronological age.
A high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) measurement from Quest Diagnostics was less than 0.3 mg/L, which is the limit of detection.

### Historical Levine Phenotypic Age Data (2018-2022)

Previous biological age results since 2018 encompass 21 blood tests:

*   **2018-2019 (3 measurements):** Average biological age was 36.1 years.
*   **2020 (6 measurements):** Average biological age was 35.6 years.
*   **2021 (6 measurements):** Average biological age was 35.6 years.
*   **2022 (thus far, 6 measurements):** Average biological age has reduced to 34.0 years.

A two-sample t-test comparing the 2020-2021 data (12 blood tests) versus the six blood tests in 2022 showed a significant reduction in Levine's biological age (p=0.04).

Another comparison involves the chronological age minus biological age reduction:

*   **Prior to 2022 (15 tests from 2018-2021):** The average reduction was approximately 12 years.
*   **First six tests in 2022:** The average chronological age minus biological age reduction has been consistently better than 12 years for each test, ranging from a low of 13.6 years to a high of 17.2 years. The average reduction for these six tests is 15.3 years, indicating a further improvement compared to the 2018-2021 average.

## Aging.ai 3.0

Aging.ai 3.0 is another free-to-use biological age predictor.

### Protocol for Using Aging.ai:

*   Navigate to the aging.ai website.
*   Enter the 19 required variables from blood test data.

Using the latest blood test data, the predicted age was 33 years, which is 16.7 years younger than chronological age.

### Historical Aging.ai Age Data (2009-2022)

More data points are available for aging.ai because it does not include hs-CRP, which was not consistently ordered in earlier blood tests.

*   **2009-2013 (3 tests):** Average aging.ai age was 32 years.
*   **2016-2021 (27 tests):** Average aging.ai age was 29.9 years.
*   **First six tests in 2022:** Average aging.ai age is 29.7 years.

A comparison between the 2016-2021 data and the six tests in 2022 indicates no statistically significant difference between these two groups. The aging.ai age has remained consistently in the 29-32 year range since 2009, irrespective of chronological age.

## Factors Potentially Contributing to Biological Age Reductions

Further investigation is planned to analyze the specific contributions of supplements, fitness, and diet to these observed biological age reductions.
