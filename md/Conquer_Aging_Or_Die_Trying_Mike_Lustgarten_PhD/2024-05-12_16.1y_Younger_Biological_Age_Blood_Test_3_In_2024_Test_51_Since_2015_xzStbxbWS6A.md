# 2024-05-12 16.1y Younger Biological Age Blood Test 3 In 2024 Test 51 Since 2015

## Executive Summary

*   The most recent blood test (May 12, 2024) resulted in a biological age of 35.2 years, which is 16.1 years younger than the chronological age of 51.2 years.
*   Analysis of 32 biological age tests since 2018 shows a trend of potential slowing of biological age, with an average biological age of 33.7 years over three tests in 2024 so far.
*   Five key biomarkers (RDW%, Glucose, Albumin, hs-CRP, Lymphocyte Percentage) were compared against age-expected data. In all cases, the individual's measured values were significantly more favorable, aligning with younger chronological ages.
*   Over the period since 2015, the individual has demonstrated a resistance to age-related increases in RDW%, glucose, and hs-CRP, and has maintained favorable levels for Albumin and Lymphocyte Percentage, despite chronological aging.
*   A trend of improved performance in RDW%, Glucose, and hs-CRP has been observed more prominently since around age 48, potentially linked to intentional weight loss and dietary changes.

## Biological Age Calculation

*   **Current Test (2024-05-12):**
    *   Biological Age: 35.2 years
    *   Chronological Age: 51.2 years
    *   Difference: -16.1 years (Younger)
*   **Methodology:** Dr. Morgan Levine's phenotypic age calculator.
*   **Note on hs-CRP:** The lab measurement was less than 0.3 mg/L (Quest Diagnostic Lab's detection limit), suggesting the actual biological age might be even lower than calculated.

## Historical Biological Age Trends (Since 2018)

*   **2018-2019 (3 tests):** Average biological age: 36.1 years (hs-CRP not consistently measured)
*   **2020-2021 (12 tests):** Average biological age: 35.6 years
*   **2022 (7 tests):** Average biological age: 33.8 years
*   **2023 (3 tests):** Average biological age: 34.7 years
*   **2024 (3 tests thus far):** Average biological age: 33.7 years

This data suggests a potential slowing of biological age over time, rather than reversal. The approach focuses on living longer by slowing aging through diet, exercise, and targeted nutrient intake, aiming to bridge the gap until rejuvenation technologies become available.

## Biomarker Analysis vs. Age-Expected Data

The following analysis compares the individual's current test results for five key biomarkers against age-expected values derived from population studies.

### 1. Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW%)

*   **Definition:** Measures the variability in red blood cell volume.
*   **Age-Expected Trend:** RDW% increases during aging.
*   **Age-Expected Value (for 51.2 years):** 14%
*   **Current Test Value:** 11.7% (More typical of younger individuals)
*   **Impact on Biological Age (if RDW% was 14%):** +8 years (Biological Age would increase to 43 years)
*   **Long-Term Trend (Since 2015, 48 tests):** Significant inverse correlation (r = -0.63, p < 0.05) between RDW% and chronological age, indicating resistance to age-related increases.

### 2. Glucose

*   **Age-Expected Trend:** Glucose levels increase during aging.
*   **Age-Expected Value (for 51.2 years):** 99 mg/dL
*   **Current Test Value:** 88 mg/dL (More typical of individuals approximately half the chronological age)
*   **Impact on Biological Age (if Glucose was 99 mg/dL, RDW% 14%):** Biological Age increases to ~45 years.
*   **Long-Term Trend (Since 2015, 49 tests):** Exhibits an inverse J-shaped curve, with levels increasing up to ~48 years of age and then decreasing. Average glucose since 2015 is 89.5 mg/dL, corresponding to a chronological age of ~20 years younger.

### 3. Albumin

*   **Age-Expected Trend:** Albumin levels decline during aging.
*   **Age-Expected Value (for 51.2 years):** ~43 g/L (4.3 g/dL)
*   **Current Test Value:** 4.9 g/dL (More typical of younger individuals)
*   **Impact on Biological Age (if Albumin was 4.3 g/dL, Glucose 99 mg/dL, RDW% 14%):** Biological Age increases to 47 years.
*   **Long-Term Trend (Since 2015, 50 tests):** The trend line is essentially flat, indicating no significant age-related decline. Average albumin levels are 4.9 g/dL, aligning with youthful levels.

### 4. High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP)

*   **Age-Expected Trend:** hs-CRP increases during aging.
*   **Age-Expected Value (for 51.2 years):** 1.4 mg/L
*   **Current Test Value:** 0.3 mg/L (Below the detection limit for each age group in the study)
*   **Impact on Biological Age (if hs-CRP was 1.4 mg/L, Albumin 4.3 g/dL, Glucose 99 mg/dL, RDW% 14%):** Biological Age increases to 48.6 years.
*   **Long-Term Trend (Since 2018, 35 tests):** Significant inverse correlation, meaning hs-CRP has been significantly reduced as chronological age has increased, indicating resistance to the age-related increase.

### 5. Lymphocyte Percentage

*   **Age-Expected Trend:** Lymphocyte percentage declines during aging.
*   **Age-Expected Value (for 51.2 years):** 24.2%
*   **Current Test Value:** 36.6% (Significantly higher than expected for chronological age, more typical of youth)
*   **Impact on Biological Age (if Lymphocyte Percentage was 24.2%, and other biomarkers age-expected):** Biological Age becomes 50.2 years (just one year away from chronological age).
*   **Long-Term Trend (Since 2015, 48 tests):** Exhibits a J-shaped curve, with a decline in lymphocyte percentage up to ~48 years of age, followed by an increase. Average lymphocyte percentage over this period is 41.9%, which is still considered youthful.

## Potential Contributing Factors to Biomarker Improvement (Around Age 48)

*   **Intentional Weight Loss:** Slow and steady fat loss over the past three years, aiming for maximum leanness, appears to have had a positive impact on at least three of these biomarkers (likely RDW%, Glucose, and hs-CRP).
*   **Diet and Supplements:** Specific dietary and supplement protocols that align with blood test number three in 2024 are planned for discussion in a future update.
