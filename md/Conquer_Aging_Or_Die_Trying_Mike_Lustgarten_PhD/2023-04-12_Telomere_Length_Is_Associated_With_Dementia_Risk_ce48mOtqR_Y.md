# 2023-04-12 Telomere Length Is Associated With Dementia Risk

## Executive Summary

*   Telomere attrition (shortening) is a recognized hallmark of aging, with leukocyte telomere length decreasing consistently in both males and females from youth (approx. 7.75 kb) into advanced age (approx. 5.75 kb).
*   A large study ($\text{N} \approx 32,000$) demonstrated that relatively shorter leukocyte telomere lengths are significantly associated with an increased relative hazard (risk) for the incidence of dementia over a 13-year follow-up period.
*   Conversely, increasing leukocyte telomere length is associated with a significantly *reduced* incidence of dementia.
*   Personal testing showed the speaker's average telomere length (around 7.02 kb to 7.13 kb) is below the expected youthful level (7.75 kb), indicating room for improvement.
*   A short-term intervention using Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) over a seven-day period immediately preceding the latest test did not result in a measurable positive impact on the speaker's telomere length.

## Biological Context: Telomere Attrition

Telomeres are the protective portions of DNA located at the ends of chromosomes.

*   Telomere shortening (attrition) is classified as one of the 12 hallmarks of aging.
*   **Age-Related Decline:** Leukocyte (white blood cell) telomere length declines with increasing age for both men and women.
    *   **Youth:** Average length is approximately 7.75 kilobases (kb).
    *   **Advanced Age (Centenarians):** Average length is approximately 5.75 kb.

## Human Evidence: Telomere Length and Dementia Risk

A study investigating the link between telomere length and cognitive health included approximately 32,000 participants.

*   **Study Design:**
    *   Average initial age: 55 years.
    *   Follow-up period: Median of 13 years.
    *   Measurement: Incidence of dementia assessed following the initial measurement of leukocyte telomere length (WBC).
*   **Findings:**
    *   When plotting the relative hazard (risk) for dementia against leukocyte telomere length, a significant association was observed.
    *   **Conclusion:** As leukocyte telomere length increases, the relative hazard/risk for dementia incidence significantly decreases.

## Personal Telomere Measurement Tracking

The speaker tracked their telomere length using diagnostic testing (which also measures epigenetics) over five tests between May 2022 and March 2023.

| Test | Date Range | Average Telomere Length (kb) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | May - Oct 2022 | 7.02 | Below youthful expectation (7.75 kb) |
| 2 | May - Oct 2022 | 7.07 | |
| 3 | May - Oct 2022 | 7.04 | |
| 4 | Jan 2023 | 7.13 | Improved length |
| 5 | Mar 2023 | 7.13 | Latest measurement |

**Intervention and NMN Effect:**

*   **NMN Dosage (Test 4 to Test 5):** The speaker consumed NMN at an average of 340 mg/day between the fourth and fifth tests.
*   **Acute NMN Dosage:** 1 gram of NMN was consumed for the seven days immediately preceding Test 5.
*   **Result:** Despite the intervention, there was no observed positive effect or change in telomere length between Test 4 and Test 5 for the speaker.

**Future Direction:**

The speaker plans to track subsequent telomere length measurements against corresponding dietary records to identify correlations that may help optimize length closer to youthful levels (7.75 kb).
