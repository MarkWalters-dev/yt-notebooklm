# 2020-08-21 Calorie Restriction vs. Rapamycin - Which Is Better at Extending Maximal Lifespan

## Executive Summary
*   Calorie restriction (CR) is a highly effective intervention for extending both average and maximal lifespan in mice, with the most significant extensions reaching up to 55 months of maximal lifespan in female C3B10F1 mice under 75% CR.
*   The effectiveness of CR is dose-dependent and can vary significantly based on gender and genetic background; for example, 40% CR extended average lifespan in male C57BL/6J mice but not females of the same strain, and did not extend maximal lifespan in either.
*   Rapamycin treatment also extends average lifespan in mice across various strains and doses, but its effect on maximal lifespan is generally more modest, with the highest observed maximal lifespan reaching 42-43 months in genetically heterogeneous female mice.
*   In direct comparisons using C57BL/6J mice, 20% CR consistently led to longer maximal lifespans than rapamycin treatment in both sexes (e.g., 44-45 months for CR females vs. 36-37 months for rapamycin-treated females; 41-42 months for CR males vs. 36-37 months for rapamycin-treated males).
*   Overall, Calorie Restriction maintains its status as the "gold standard" for lifespan extension in mice, demonstrating superior capabilities in extending maximal lifespan compared to rapamycin across the studies examined.

## Calorie Restriction (CR) Studies

### CR in Female C3B10F1 Mice (Lifelong CR)
Lifelong calorie restriction was initiated at one month of age in female C3B10F1 mice. Lifespan was assessed by measuring the average lifespan (50% survival point) and maximum lifespan (the lowest point on the survival curve).

*   **Control (Ad Libitum):**
    *   Average Lifespan: 29 months
    *   Maximum Lifespan: 36 months
*   **47% CR (85 kcal/week vs. 160 kcal/week Ad Libitum):**
    *   Average Lifespan: 33 months
    *   Maximum Lifespan: 42 months (a >10% increase)
*   **69% CR (50 kcal/week):**
    *   Average Lifespan: 45 months
    *   Maximum Lifespan: 52 months
*   **75% CR (40 kcal/week):**
    *   Average Lifespan: 47 months
    *   Maximum Lifespan: 55 months

The data indicates that reducing calorie intake progressively increased both average and maximum lifespan in female C3B10F1 mice.

### CR in Male C3B10F1 Mice (Later-Life CR)
Calorie restriction was started from 12 months of age in male C3B10F1 mice, which is comparable to starting CR in a human's thirties or mid-thirties.

*   **Control (No CR):**
    *   Average Lifespan: 35 months
    *   Maximum Lifespan: 43 months
*   **CR (specific percentage not given but curves were shifted):**
    *   Average Lifespan: 38 months
    *   Maximum Lifespan: 48 months

Based on these studies, calorie restriction consistently resulted in maximal lifespans ranging from 45 to 55 months in C3B10F1 mice.

### CR in C57BL/6J Mice

#### Female C57BL/6J Mice
These mice were subjected to either 20% or 40% CR.

*   **Control:**
    *   Average Lifespan: 25-26 months
    *   Maximum Lifespan: 33 months
*   **20% CR:**
    *   Average Lifespan: 36-37 months
    *   Maximum Lifespan: 44-45 months
*   **40% CR:**
    *   Average Lifespan: Not significantly different from controls.
    *   Maximum Lifespan: Not significantly different from controls.
    The dose of calorie restriction is critical, as 40% CR did not extend lifespan in these female C57BL/6J mice.

#### Male C57BL/6J Mice
These mice were subjected to either 20% or 40% CR.

*   **Control:**
    *   Average Lifespan: 25-26 months
    *   Maximum Lifespan: 36 months
*   **20% CR:**
    *   Average Lifespan: 33-34 months
    *   Maximum Lifespan: 41-42 months
*   **40% CR:**
    *   Average Lifespan: Around 30 months (increased compared to control).
    *   Maximum Lifespan: Around 36 months (not different from control).
In male C57BL/6J mice, 40% CR increased average lifespan but not maximal lifespan, highlighting gender-specific effects in CR efficacy.

## Rapamycin Studies

### Study 1: Rapamycin in C57BL/6J Mice
This study administered rapamycin at 126 parts per million (ppm), starting at 23-24 months of age (late-life supplementation). Average lifespan for C57BL/6J mice is typically around 30 months.

#### Female C57BL/6J Mice
*   **Control (Placebo-fed):**
    *   Average Lifespan: 30-31 months
    *   Maximum Lifespan: 36-37 months
*   **Rapamycin Treated:**
    *   Average Lifespan: 31-32 months (small but significant increase)
    *   Maximum Lifespan: 36-37 months (no increase)

#### Male C57BL/6J Mice
*   **Rapamycin Treated:**
    *   Average Lifespan: 34-35 months (dramatic increase)
    *   Maximum Lifespan: 36-37 months (did not exceed 40 months)

### Study 2: Rapamycin in Genetically Heterogeneous Mice (Lower Dose)
This study used genetically heterogeneous mice (mixed genetic backgrounds) and a lower rapamycin dose of 14 ppm. Data was combined from studies conducted at three universities.

#### Female Genetically Heterogeneous Mice
*   **Rapamycin Treated:**
    *   Average Lifespan: 33-34 months
    *   Maximum Lifespan: 41-42 months
    Both average and maximal lifespans showed significant increases compared to controls, but did not reach the 45-55 month range seen with CR.

#### Male Genetically Heterogeneous Mice
*   **Rapamycin Treated:**
    *   Average Lifespan: 31-32 months
    *   Maximum Lifespan: 39 months
    Average lifespan was shifted to the right for rapamycin-treated males, but no clear increase in maximal lifespan was noted in this study.

### Study 3: Rapamycin Dose Response in Genetically Heterogeneous Mice
This study tested various rapamycin doses in genetically heterogeneous mice (a slightly different group from Study 2): a low dose, 14 ppm, and 42 ppm. All doses were less than 126 ppm.

#### Female Genetically Heterogeneous Mice
All rapamycin doses extended average and maximal lifespan compared to controls.
*   **Best Maximum Lifespan:** 42-43 months.
This result, while significant, still falls short of the 45-55 month maximal lifespan observed with optimal CR.

#### Male Genetically Heterogeneous Mice
*   **Low Dose Rapamycin:** No change in lifespan.
*   **14 ppm and 42 ppm Rapamycin:** Increased median and maximal lifespan.
*   **Best Maximum Lifespan:** 40-41 months.

Based on these three studies, rapamycin-supplemented mice generally lived up to a maximum of 42-43 months.

## Comparison and Conclusions

When comparing rapamycin and calorie restriction:

*   **Overall Maximal Lifespan Achieved:**
    *   **Calorie Restriction (CR):** Up to 55 months in female C3B10F1 mice.
    *   **Rapamycin:** Up to 42-43 months in genetically heterogeneous female mice.

*   **Direct Comparison in C57BL/6J Mice:**
    *   **Female C57BL/6J Mice:** 20% CR resulted in an average lifespan of 36-37 months and a maximal lifespan of 44-45 months. Rapamycin treatment, in contrast, yielded an average lifespan of 31-32 months and a maximal lifespan of 36-37 months. Thus, 20% CR was more effective than rapamycin in extending both average and maximal lifespan in female C57BL/6J mice.
    *   **Male C57BL/6J Mice:** 20% CR led to an average lifespan of 33-34 months and a maximal lifespan of 41-42 months. Rapamycin treatment resulted in an average lifespan of 34-35 months and a maximal lifespan of 36-37 months. While average lifespan was comparable, 20% CR significantly extended maximal lifespan further than rapamycin in male C57BL/6J mice.

*   **Factors Affecting CR Efficacy:**
    *   The **magnitude of calorie reduction** is critical (e.g., 20% vs. 40% CR).
    *   **Gender-specific effects** are observed, with females sometimes showing greater lifespan extension on CR than males.
    *   **Genetic background** can also influence the response to CR.

Despite these nuances, calorie restriction remains the intervention that has demonstrated the greatest increase in maximal lifespan in mice to date, consistently outperforming rapamycin in achieving longer maximal lifespans.
