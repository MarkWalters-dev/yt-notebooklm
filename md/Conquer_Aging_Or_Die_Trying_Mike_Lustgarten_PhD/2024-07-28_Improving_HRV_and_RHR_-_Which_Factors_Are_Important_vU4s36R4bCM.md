# 2024-07-28 Improving HRV and RHR - Which Factors Are Important

### Executive Summary
*   Over a six-year period (2018-2024), Heart Rate Variability (HRV) increased by 41% (from 47 ms to 66.6 ms), and Resting Heart Rate (RHR) decreased by 18% (from 51 bpm to 42 bpm).
*   Higher Average Daily Heart Rate (ADHR) is strongly correlated with a higher next-day RHR (correlation coefficient = 0.74, p < 0.05) and a lower next-day HRV (correlation coefficient = -0.53, p < 0.05).
*   Maintaining a deliberate balance between active and rest days is critical to optimize HRV and RHR and avoid chronic overtraining.
*   Lower body weight is strongly correlated with a lower RHR (correlation coefficient = 0.73, p ≈ 0) and a higher HRV (correlation coefficient = -0.46, p < 0.05).

## Physical Activity
Physical activity is tracked using Average Daily Heart Rate (ADHR) as a metric for intensity, correlating it with resting heart rate (RHR) and heart rate variability (HRV).

### Correlation of ADHR with Resting Heart Rate
Analysis of 1,500 days of data (March 2020 - June 2024) reveals a strong positive correlation between the previous day's ADHR and the next day's RHR. The correlation coefficient is 0.74 (p < 0.05, 4 x 10^-272). This indicates that higher daily activity is associated with a higher resting heart rate.

### Correlation of ADHR with Heart Rate Variability
Over the same 1,500-day period, there is a significant inverse correlation between the previous day's ADHR and the next day's HRV, with a correlation coefficient of -0.53 (p < 0.05, 2 x 10^-115). This suggests that higher daily activity is associated with lower heart rate variability.

### Implications for Training
Overall, elevated ADHR consistently correlates with reduced HRV and increased RHR. Therefore, balancing active and rest days is crucial to prevent chronic overtraining, which manifests as lower HRV and higher RHR.

### Optimized Workout Protocol
The following workout protocol has been developed to optimize RHR and HRV towards youthful values:

*   Two 90-minute full-body circuit training workouts per week.
*   No rest periods between sets; continuous circuit training for the entire 90 minutes.
*   Focus on compound movements: overhead press, pull-ups, seated rows, push-ups (off a ball), deadlifts, weighted step-ups.
*   Includes extensive mobility, flexibility, and Taekwondo-based movements to optimize joint range of motion.

### Activity Titration and Scheduling
The scheduling of workouts and recovery days is managed to optimize recovery and prevent overtraining:

*   **Active Day (e.g., Friday):** ADHR typically around 56 beats per minute (bpm), which is 14-16 bpm above the typical RHR of 40-42 bpm.
*   **Titrated Lower Activity (e.g., Saturday, Sunday):** ADHR is purposefully reduced to around 54 bpm, then 52 bpm over these two days.
*   **Next Active Day (e.g., Monday):** ADHR increases back to around 56 bpm for the next workout.
*   **Recovery Days (3 days post-Monday workout):** Low intensity activity, typically light walking, is maintained to allow full recovery of RHR, HRV, and muscle fatigue.
*   **Flexibility:** Workout intensity and duration are adjusted based on real-time HRV and RHR data to avoid overtraining. While full 90-minute sessions are preferred to prevent detraining, modifications are made when data indicates a trend towards overtraining.

## Body Weight
Beyond physical activity, body weight significantly impacts RHR and HRV. Body weight is consistently measured fasted each morning.

### Correlation of Body Weight with Resting Heart Rate
Analysis of almost 2,200 days of data shows a strong positive correlation between daily body weight and RHR. The correlation coefficient is 0.73 (p ≈ 0, indicating extremely high significance). This means higher body weight is strongly associated with a higher resting heart rate. At the leanest body weight (~138 lbs), RHR has approached 40 bpm.

### Correlation of Body Weight with Heart Rate Variability
Over the same 2,200-day period, there is a significant inverse correlation between daily body weight and HRV, with a correlation coefficient of -0.46 (p < 0.05, 2 x 10^-110). This indicates that higher body weight is associated with lower heart rate variability. At the leanest body weight (~138 lbs), HRV has approached relatively youthful values of 70 milliseconds.

### Overall Impact of Body Weight
Both RHR and HRV demonstrate more youthful values as body weight decreases.
