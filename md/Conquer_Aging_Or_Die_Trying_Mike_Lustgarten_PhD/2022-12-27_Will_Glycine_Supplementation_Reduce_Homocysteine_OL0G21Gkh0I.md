# 2022-12-27 Will Glycine Supplementation Reduce Homocysteine

## Executive Summary

*   Homocysteine levels increase with age, with values in individuals over 80 years old significantly exceeding the reference range.
*   Elevated homocysteine is associated with increased all-cause mortality risk and adverse health outcomes across multiple organ systems.
*   Adequate intake of folate, vitamin B12, and betaine are generally sufficient for homocysteine metabolism, but vitamin B6 and the amino acid serine are also required.
*   Glycine can be converted to serine, which is then used in the conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine, potentially reducing homocysteine levels.
*   Glycine supplementation may also boost glutathione synthesis, as it is a component of glutathione.

## Homocysteine and Aging

*   Plasma homocysteine levels plotted against age show a consistent increase from youth (around 7 micromolar) to individuals over 80 years old (approximately 12 micromolar).
*   The reference range for homocysteine is generally considered to be less than 11.4 micromolar.
*   A study of over 1,700 centenarians with a median age of 100 years reported serum homocysteine levels of 23.1 micromolar, indicating significant elevation in extreme longevity.

## Homocysteine and Mortality/Health Risks

*   A meta-analysis of six studies demonstrates a positive correlation between circulating homocysteine levels and the relative risk of all-cause mortality.
*   The risk of all-cause mortality increases as homocysteine levels rise, with an optimal state potentially being as low as possible.
*   Elevated homocysteine (defined as >15 micromolar) is associated with adverse health and/or function of the:
    *   Cardiovascular system
    *   Brain
    *   Eyes and ears
    *   Female reproductive apparatus
    *   Pancreas
    *   Bone
    *   Kidney

## Personal Homocysteine Data

*   **2005-2009:** Average homocysteine level was 7.1 micromolar over six blood tests during early to mid-thirties.
*   **2017-Present:** Average homocysteine level is 10.2 micromolar over 23 blood tests.
*   A two-sample t-test indicates a statistically significant increase in homocysteine levels between these two periods, suggesting an age-related rise.

## Homocysteine Metabolism

Homocysteine levels can be influenced by several metabolic pathways:

*   **Folate and B12 Pathway:**
    Dietary Folic Acid -> Serum Folate + Vitamin B12 + Homocysteine -> Methionine
*   **Betaine Pathway:**
    Dietary Betaine (Trimethylglycine) + Homocysteine -> Methionine
*   **Futile Cycle Concern:** Increased Methionine -> S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) -> S-Adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) -> Homocysteine
*   **Vitamin B6 and Serine Pathway:**
    Homocysteine + Serine (with adequate Vitamin B6) -> Cystathionine

## Analysis of Personal Nutrient Intake

*   For blood test #7 (2022), average daily intake of folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 were analyzed.
*   **Folate:** 2.5-fold higher than RDA.
*   **Vitamin B12:** 5-fold higher than RDA.
*   **Vitamin B6:** 2-fold higher than RDA.
*   These results indicate that deficiencies in folate, B12, or B6 are unlikely to be limiting homocysteine metabolism.

## Glycine Supplementation Hypothesis

*   **Question:** Could suboptimal levels of the amino acid serine be contributing to homocysteine accumulation? Will glycine supplementation increase serine and thereby reduce homocysteine?
*   **Glycine Metabolism:**
    Glycine -> Serine
    Serine + Homocysteine (with adequate Vitamin B6) -> Cystathionine
*   **Potential Benefits of Glycine Supplementation:**
    *   Increases serine levels, facilitating the conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine.
    *   Cystathionine is one enzymatic step away from forming cystine.
    *   Cystine is a component of glutathione.
    *   Glycine is also a component of glutathione.
*   Therefore, glycine supplementation may:
    *   Reduce homocysteine by increasing serine.
    *   Boost glutathione (GSH) synthesis.

## Planned Intervention

*   Glycine supplementation began on December 15, 2022.
*   The first blood test to assess the impact of supplementation will be in mid to late January 2023.
