# 2025-05-07 Is NAD Associated With Biomarkers Of Mitochondrial Function

## Executive Summary

*   NAD is a critical cofactor for the TCA cycle, essential for mitochondrial energy production, with NAD levels potentially declining during aging.
*   Lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) in plasma have been identified as biomarkers associated with mitochondrial function, with higher LPC levels correlating with better mitochondrial capacity.
*   In personal testing, NAD levels were not initially significantly correlated with the sum of LPCs, but after removing a mathematical outlier, an inverse correlation was observed, suggesting lower NAD with higher LPCs.
*   Elevated NAD levels achieved through precursors showed an association with lower LPCs, further suggesting an inverse relationship, prompting questions about optimal NAD levels.
*   A single high LPC data point, potentially an outlier, was noted to be similar to levels observed in Alzheimer's patients, hinting at potential early warning signals for pathology.

## Mitochondrial Energy Production and NAD

*   NAD is required for mitochondrial energy production.
*   Within the mitochondrial matrix, NAD plays a crucial role in the TCA cycle.
*   NAD acts as a cofactor in two key TCA cycle reactions:
    *   Isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG)
    *   AKG to succinyl CoA
*   These reactions produce NAD as a byproduct.
*   NADH, derived from NAD, donates protons to Complex I of the electron transport chain, driving ATP production.
*   NAD levels may decline during aging, though this is not a universally observed finding.
*   A decline in NAD could lead to reduced NADH production, consequently impacting mitochondrial ATP production, particularly via Complex I.

## Lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) as Biomarkers of Mitochondrial Function

### Phosphatidylcholine Structure

*   Phosphatidylcholine is a phospholipid containing two fatty acids attached to a glycerol backbone, which is also linked to phosphorylcholine.
*   Example: Phosphatidylcholine 18:0/20:4 includes stearic acid (18 carbons, 0 double bonds) and arachidonic acid (20 carbons, 4 double bonds).

### Formation of LPCs

*   Under pro-inflammatory conditions, phospholipase A2 (PLA2) cleaves one fatty acid from phosphatidylcholine.
*   This process releases free fatty acids (e.g., arachidonic acid) and results in the formation of lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs).
*   An example is LPC 18:0, which consists of the glycerol backbone, stearic acid, and phosphorylcholine.

### LPCs and Mitochondrial Function Assessment

*   Plasma levels of LPCs have been associated with mitochondrial oxidative capacity and function.
*   A study assessed the association between plasma LPC levels and skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in vivo.
*   Mitochondrial function was quantified using phosphorus-labeled magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the thigh, measuring phosphocreatine recovery after exhaustive exercise.
*   Participants were divided into quartiles based on mitochondrial function, with Quartile 1 representing the worst and Quartile 4 the best function.
*   **Finding:** LPC levels were lowest in Quartile 1 and increased progressively through Quartile 4, indicating that higher LPC levels are associated with better mitochondrial function.
*   Most LPC species, with the exception of LPC 16:0 initially, showed a significant association with in vivo mitochondrial function.

### LPCs and VO2 Max

*   VO2 max, a measure of cardiorespiratory fitness, was also assessed in relation to LPC levels.
*   Participants in Quartile 1 (worst mitochondrial function) had a mean VO2 max of 19.
*   Participants in Quartile 4 (best mitochondrial function) had a mean VO2 max of 26.
*   These differences in VO2 max were statistically significant (p < 0.05).
*   These data were collected from 73-year-old individuals.

### LPC 16:0 and Mitochondrial Function

*   When LPC 16:0 was specifically examined by grouping quartiles one through three against quartile four, all seven LPC species tested, including LPC 16:0, were significantly associated with mitochondrial function.
*   Higher levels of these LPCs were positively correlated with better mitochondrial function (indicated by positive beta coefficients).

## Personal Data: NAD vs. LPCs

### Initial Assessment (13 Tests)

*   NAD levels (measured by Ginfiniti) were plotted against the sum of seven LPC species (measured by iolo).
*   **Finding:** Initially, NAD levels were not significantly correlated with the sum of LPCs (p > 0.05).

### Outlier Analysis

*   One data point showed significantly higher LPCs relative to NAD levels (approximately 325 µmol/L for NAD, compared to a calculated outlier threshold of 172 µmol/L).
*   This point was identified as a mathematical outlier.
*   **Observation:** In Alzheimer's patients, LPC levels can be two to five-fold higher relative to baseline, suggesting this high LPC point might not be a random outlier but could represent an early warning signal for pathology.

### Re-evaluation Excluding Outlier (12 Tests)

*   After removing the outlier, a significant inverse correlation was observed between NAD levels and the sum of LPCs (correlation coefficient = -0.59, p = 0.04).
*   **Finding:** This suggests that lower NAD levels are associated with higher LPC levels, which in turn are associated with better mitochondrial function. This is contrary to the expected outcome.

### Impact of NAD Precursors

*   When NAD levels were artificially increased using precursors (nicotinic acid or NMN), resulting in NAD levels of approximately 50-60 µmol/L, these levels extrapolated downward were associated with worse mitochondrial function (lower LPCs).
*   This further reinforced the unexpected inverse relationship.

### Analysis Without Precursor-Influenced Data (10 Tests)

*   Removing the data points influenced by NAD precursors, covering an NAD range of 19 to 32 µmol/L, showed no significant correlation between NAD and the sum of LPCs (p > 0.05).

## Potential Interpretations and Future Questions

*   **Possibility 1:** High NAD levels may be associated with lower LPCs, indicating potentially worse mitochondrial function in the observed range.
*   **Possibility 2:** An "inverse U-shape" relationship may exist, where intermediate NAD levels (around 30 µmol/L) might be correlated with the best mitochondrial function, as higher LPCs were associated with lower NAD in this range.
*   **Possibility 3:** The outlier observation, where low NAD was associated with very high LPCs, could be linked to increased Alzheimer's disease risk, as suggested by one study.
*   The optimal level of NAD for mitochondrial function remains an open question.
*   LPCs may serve as a valuable biomarker for assessing optimal NAD levels.
