# 2023-06-18 Telomere Length Test 6 - Correlations With Diet

## Executive Summary

*   Telomere length generally declines with age, dropping from approximately 7.75 kilobases (kb) in youth to 5.75 kb in advanced age.
*   Relatively longer telomeres are associated with a significantly decreased risk for the incidence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia.
*   N-of-1 data revealed a statistically significant increase in telomere length, from an average of 7.04 kb in 2022 to 7.14 kb in 2023.
*   Lower average daily calorie intake showed a significant inverse correlation with longer telomere length in the N-of-1 data.
*   Specific foods were identified with significant positive correlations (e.g., olives) and negative correlations (e.g., cacao beans) to telomere length in the N-of-1 data.

## Telomere Length and Health Implications

Telomere length consistently declines during aging. Data indicates that average leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is around 7.75 kilobases (kb) in youth, decreasing to approximately 5.75 kb in advanced age (20 to 100 years old).

This age-related decline in telomere length is potentially significant because longer telomeres are associated with a decreased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementia. Studies show that as telomere length increases, the cumulative incident risk for AD and AD-related dementia significantly decreases over an average follow-up time of 12 years. This inverse relationship holds across various relative telomere lengths, though specific kilobase values were not reported in the studies referenced.

## N-of-1 Telomere Length Data

Over six tests conducted in 2022 and 2023, personal telomere length measurements were taken.

### Telomere Length Trends:

*   **2022:** Three tests averaged 7.04 kb.
*   **2023:** Three tests (including test #6 in April 2023 at 7.15 kb) averaged 7.14 kb.

A two-sample t-test comparing the 2022 and 2023 averages showed that the 2023 data indicated significantly longer telomere length than 2022. This suggests a positive trend, though the data set is limited to six tests (three data points per group).

## Correlations with Calorie Intake

Calorie intake may be an important factor influencing telomere length. The personal data demonstrates an inverse correlation between telomere length and average daily calorie intake over the six tests.

### Calorie Intake Measurement Protocol:

*   Average daily calorie intake was calculated from the day of the previous telomere length test to the day before the most recent test.
*   This average intake was then correlated with the telomere length result from the most recent blood test.

This inverse correlation means that when calorie intake was relatively high, telomere length was relatively low, and conversely, a relatively lower calorie intake was significantly correlated with a longer telomere length.

## Foods Positively Correlated with Longer Telomere Length

Analysis of dietary components over the six telomere length tests identified specific foods whose higher intake significantly correlated with longer telomere length (p < 0.05). No adjustments for multiple comparisons were made to avoid discarding potentially relevant data.

### Approach to Intake:
*   For foods with a positive correlation, consuming at the higher end of the personal intake range may be beneficial.

**Example: Olives**
*   **Intake Range (past 6 tests):** 0.3 - 2.1 grams per day
*   **Last Test Intake:** 2.1 grams per day
*   **Observation:** Intake for the last test was at the high end of the range, consistent with the positive correlation.

## Foods Negatively Correlated with Longer Telomere Length

Conversely, some foods showed a significant inverse correlation, meaning a relatively higher intake was associated with a shorter telomere length (p < 0.05).

### Approach to Intake:
*   For foods with a negative correlation, consuming at the lower end of the personal intake range may be beneficial.

**Example: Cacao Beans**
*   **Intake Range (past 6 tests):** 5 - 10 grams per day
*   **Last Test Intake:** 5.2 grams per day
*   **Observation:** Intake for the last test was at the lower end of the range, consistent with the inverse correlation.

Other foods like dates and corn also showed negative correlations, with current intake generally aligning towards the lower end of the personal range, although some further reduction might be possible to optimize.

The overall strategy involves adjusting intake of both positively and negatively correlated foods to potentially optimize telomere length.
