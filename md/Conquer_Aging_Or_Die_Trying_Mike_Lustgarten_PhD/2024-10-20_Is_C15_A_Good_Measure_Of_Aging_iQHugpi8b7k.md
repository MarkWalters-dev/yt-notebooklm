# 2024-10-20 Is C15 A Good Measure Of Aging

## Executive Summary

*   Pentadecanoic acid (C15) itself is not significantly associated with younger epigenetic age as measured by PhenoAge and GrimAge.
*   Cholesterol ester containing pentadecanoic acid (CE15) is significantly associated with younger epigenetic age according to both PhenoAge and GrimAge.
*   Two other saturated fatty acids, C22 and C24, are significantly associated with younger PhenoAge and may be influenced by peanut intake.
*   CE15 levels are potentially trackable and optimizable, suggesting it could be a modifiable marker related to aging.
*   Personal CE15 levels in the transcript data showed a slight downward trend, indicating a potential age-related decline, though not statistically significant between two periods.

## Introduction to Pentadecanoic Acid (C15)

Pentadecanoic acid (C15) is a saturated fatty acid that has gained attention in aging research due to its association with longevity-enhancing compounds and its deficiency being linked to accelerated aging-related diseases. This note examines whether C15 is a good measure of aging.

## C15 and Epigenetic Age

### C15 Alone and Epigenetic Age

*   C15 (pentadecanoic acid) is not associated with a younger epigenetic age when assessed against gold standard epigenetic clocks, PhenoAge and GrimAge.
*   Age acceleration is defined as an epigenetic age higher than chronological age. A negative age acceleration (epigenetic age lower than chronological age) is desired.
*   The 95% confidence intervals for C15's association with both PhenoAge and GrimAge overlap with the significance line (zero), indicating no statistically significant association with younger epigenetic age.

### Other Fatty Acids and Epigenetic Age

*   Saturated fatty acids C22 and C24 are significantly associated with a younger PhenoAge.
*   Plasma levels of C22 and C24 can be increased by peanut intake.
*   The mechanism for this association (dietary intake vs. endogenous production) is not yet fully clarified.

### Cholesterol Ester C15 (CE15) and Epigenetic Age

*   **Good News:** Cholesterol ester containing pentadecanoic acid (CE15) is significantly associated with a younger epigenetic age for both PhenoAge and GrimAge.
*   CE15 is a form where pentadecanoic acid is bound to cholesterol.
*   Analysis shows that CE15, not C15 on its own, demonstrates a significant association with younger epigenetic age across both epigenetic clocks.
*   This suggests that CE15 is a potentially modifiable marker related to aging.

## Personal Metabolomic Data: CE15 Levels

*   **Data Tracking:** CE15 levels can be tracked using at-home metabolomics kits.
*   **Personal Data (2023-2024):**
    *   **2023 (5 tests):** Average CE15 level was 7.77 micromolar.
    *   **2024 (6 tests):** Average CE15 level was 6.8 micromolar.
*   **Observation:** The personal data shows a slight downward trend in CE15 levels from 2023 to 2024, which is in the "wrong direction" for maintaining a younger epigenetic age.
*   **Statistical Significance:** A two-sample t-test comparing the 2023 and 2024 data yielded a p-value greater than 0.05, meaning the difference is not statistically significant.
*   **Goal:** The aim is to maintain stable or slightly increase CE15 levels to avoid age-related decline.

## Future Directions

*   Further research is needed to understand the direct association of CE15 with aging and all-cause mortality risk.
*   Updates on personal CE15 levels are expected in future analyses.
