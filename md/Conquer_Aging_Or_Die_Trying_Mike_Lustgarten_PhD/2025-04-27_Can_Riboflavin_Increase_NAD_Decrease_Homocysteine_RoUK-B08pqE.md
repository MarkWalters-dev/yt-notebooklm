# 2025-04-27 Can Riboflavin Increase NAD Decrease Homocysteine

## Executive Summary

*   Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) is a required cofactor in the *de novo* NAD synthesis pathway, specifically in the conversion of kynurenine to 3-hydroxykynurenine.
*   A significant correlation (r=0.51, p<0.05) was observed between seven-day average riboflavin intake and blood intracellular NAD levels in the speaker's personal data.
*   This correlation between riboflavin and NAD remained statistically significant (p≈0.05, r=0.59) even after removing data points where nicotinic acid or NMN supplementation was used.
*   Riboflavin plays a crucial role in the folate pathway, acting as a cofactor for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), which is essential for converting tetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate.
*   Increased 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, facilitated by adequate riboflavin, can improve the conversion of homocysteine to methionine, potentially lowering homocysteine levels.

## NAD Synthesis Pathway

The *de novo* NAD synthesis pathway converts the amino acid tryptophan into NAD through a series of enzymatic steps. Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) is a required cofactor in this pathway for the conversion of kynurenine into 3-hydroxykynurenine. Suboptimal riboflavin levels can lead to inefficient conversion of tryptophan to NAD.

## Riboflavin and NAD Correlation

In personal data collected over a period from 2023-2025, a significant correlation was observed between seven-day average riboflavin intake and blood intracellular NAD levels.

*   **Correlation Coefficient:** 0.51
*   **P-value:** < 0.05 (specifically 0.01)
*   **Measurement:** NAD levels were measured by sending blood samples to Ginfinity.
*   **Riboflavin Intake:** Tracked using Cronometer and averaged over seven days to account for rapid NAD level fluctuations.

## Comparison with Other NAD Precursors

*   **Niacin (Nicotinic Acid):** Showed a strong correlation with NAD levels (r=0.75, p<0.05). When niacin intake exceeded approximately 50 mg/day, it was primarily from nicotinic acid supplementation.
*   **NMN:** Also correlated with NAD levels (r=0.44, p<0.05), but the correlation was less strong compared to nicotinic acid.
*   **Dose Response:** Nicotinic acid appears to raise NAD at lower doses compared to NMN.

## Riboflavin's Independent Effect on NAD

To assess the independence of the riboflavin-NAD correlation, tests involving nicotinic acid (niacin intake > 50 mg/day) and NMN supplementation were excluded, leaving 12 tests.

*   **Analysis with Nicotinic Acid and NMN Excluded:**
    *   **NAD Levels on Y-axis, Seven-Day Average Riboflavin Intake on X-axis.**
    *   **Correlation Coefficient:** 0.59
    *   **P-value:** Approximately 0.05 (borderline statistically significant).
*   **Impact of Riboflavin Intake Levels:**
    *   Higher riboflavin intake (e.g., 3.7 mg/day, ~3x RDA) correlated with higher NAD levels (around 30 micromolar).
    *   Lower riboflavin intake (e.g., 2.7 mg/day) correlated with lower NAD levels (around 20 micromolar).
*   **Note:** Even at the higher end of riboflavin intake, NAD levels did not reach the peak levels (e.g., 67 micromolar) achieved with high-dose nicotinic acid or NMN supplementation. The observed difference attributed to riboflavin intake alone was approximately 5 micromolar.

## Riboflavin's Role in Homocysteine Reduction

Riboflavin is of interest for its potential to decrease homocysteine levels, an alternative strategy to common methods.

### Pathways to Decrease Homocysteine

1.  **Betaine (Trimethylglycine):** High doses (4g/day) were ineffective in the speaker's data.
2.  **Serine + Vitamin B6:** High doses of serine with increasing intake over three tests did not impact homocysteine levels.
3.  **Methylfolate + Methyl B12:** Significantly correlated with approximately 10% lower homocysteine levels.

### Riboflavin in the Folate Pathway

Riboflavin is a critical cofactor for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR).

**Folate Metabolism Pathway:**

Dietary Folate -> Tetrahydrofolate (THF) -> 5,10-Methylene Tetrahydrofolate (5,10-MTHF)

In the presence of MTHFR and **Riboflavin**, 5,10-MTHF is converted to **5-Methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF)**.

**5-MTHF + Methyl B12** -> Methionine (decreasing Homocysteine)

*   **Speaker's Homocysteine Levels:** Not attributed to MTHFR genetic variations, but rather to aging or dietary insufficiency.
*   **Hypothesis:** Increasing riboflavin intake could enhance the MTHFR-catalyzed conversion to 5-MTHF, thereby improving the efficiency of homocysteine conversion to methionine and lowering homocysteine levels.

## Future Outlook

Blood tests for NAD analysis in conjunction with other biomarkers were conducted on April 22, 2025, and an update on these findings is anticipated.
