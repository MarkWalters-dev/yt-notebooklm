# 2022-07-17 Biohacking the Oral Microbiome

## Executive Summary

*   Oral microbiome composition is linked to dental caries, periodontal disease, and systemic conditions such as atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus.
*   Xylitol effectively inhibits *Streptococcus mutans* growth by 61-76%, significantly reducing the risk of dental caries.
*   Sodium bicarbonate, a base, helps to maintain oral plaque pH above the critical level of 5.5, thereby preventing tooth demineralization and cavity formation.
*   Nitrate acts as a prebiotic for the oral microbiome, increasing beneficial nitrate-reducing bacteria like *Neisseria* and *Rothia*, while simultaneously decreasing detrimental bacteria associated with caries and halitosis (e.g., *Streptococcus*, *Veillonella*, *Porphyromonas*, *Fusobacteria*, *Leptotrichia*).
*   High dietary intake of nitrate-rich foods (e.g., green vegetables, beets, carrots) contributes to elevated oral nitrate levels, supporting a healthy oral bacterial composition.

## Oral Microbiome and Health

Oral bacteria are associated with numerous adverse health conditions, both within and outside the mouth:

*   **Oral Conditions:** Dental caries (cavities), primary endodontic infection (dental root infection), periodontal disease (gum disease), dry mouth, and Sjogren's syndrome (dry eyes).
*   **Systemic Conditions:** Atherosclerotic plaque, pneumonia, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus.

To optimize oral bacterial composition, quantification is a crucial first step. Analysis of oral bacterial composition reveals the relative abundance of different genera. For instance, beneficial genera like *Neisseria* and *Rothia* are linked with oral health. However, there is a lack of studies on how the oral microbiome changes during aging and its association with all-cause mortality risk, making it difficult to define optimal percentages for these bacteria.

Conversely, certain bacteria are linked with adverse oral and/or systemic health conditions:

*   **Dental Caries:** *Streptococcus mutans*.
*   **Atherosclerotic Plaque:** *Tannerella forsythia*, *Streptococcus sanguinis*.
*   **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** Specific bacteria (details not provided in transcript).
*   **Dental Root Infections:** Four specific bacteria (details not provided in transcript).
*   **Lupus:** Three specific bacteria (details not provided in transcript).
*   **Periodontal Disease, Sjogren's Syndrome, Pneumonia, Primary Endodontic Infection, Atherosclerotic Plaque:** *Porphyromonas gingivalis*.

## Strategies for Oral Microbiome Optimization

### Xylitol and Caries Prevention

*Streptococcus mutans* is a bacterium strongly linked with cavity formation. The presence of Xylitol significantly inhibits the growth of this bacterium.

*   **In vitro studies:**
    *   1% Xylitol led to a 76% reduction in *Streptococcus mutans* (strain 2366s1) levels compared to controls without Xylitol.
    *   Across five different *Streptococcus mutans* strains, 1% Xylitol demonstrated 61% to 76% growth inhibition.

This data supports the use of Xylitol to reduce *Streptococcus mutans* levels and mitigate dental caries risk.

### Oral Acidity and pH Regulation

Oral acidity is a major contributor to tooth decay. Plaque pH drops below 5.5, known as the "critical pH," create a high-risk environment for cavity formation due to tooth demineralization.

*   After glucose exposure:
    *   **Active cavity formation:** Rapid decline in plaque pH to below 5.5 (down to 4.5), prolonged time spent below 5.5, and slow recovery.
    *   **Inactive cavity formation:** Small dip below 5.5, followed by rapid recovery.
    *   **Cavity resistance:** Plaque pH never approaches 5.5, and quick recovery from any initial dip.

To limit oral pH drops below 5.5, Sodium Bicarbonate, a base, can be used to alkalize the mouth. A 1% Sodium Bicarbonate solution is close to isotonic with plasma.

### Peppermint Oil and Pathogen Inhibition

*Porphyromonas gingivalis* has been linked with adverse health conditions both orally and systemically, including atherosclerotic plaque, pneumonia, rheumatoid arthritis, periodontal disease, Sjogren's syndrome, and primary endodontic infection. Peppermint oil has been shown to inhibit the growth of *P. gingivalis*.

### Mouthwash Composition Protocol

A comprehensive mouthwash can be formulated to target multiple aspects of oral health:

*   **Xylitol:** 1 gram per 100 milliliters of water (1% concentration) to inhibit *Streptococcus mutans*.
*   **Sodium Bicarbonate:** 1 gram per 100 milliliters of water (1% concentration) to alkalize the mouth and prevent pH drops.
*   **Peppermint Oil:** 2 drops per 1000 milliliters (1 liter) to inhibit *Porphyromonas gingivalis*.
*   **Potassium Nitrate:** 2 grams per 1000 milliliters (32 millimolar concentration) to act as a prebiotic for beneficial oral bacteria.

### Nitrate as an Oral Prebiotic

Nitrate can act as a prebiotic, feeding existing beneficial bacteria to enable their growth.

**Nitrate Metabolism Flowchart:**
Diet rich in nitrate (green vegetables, beets, carrots) -> Increased oral levels of Nitrate (NO3-) -> Increased plasma concentration of nitrate -> Concentrated in parotid and other salivary glands -> Released into the mouth

**Impact on Oral Microbiome (In vitro study with healthy male donors' saliva):**
*   **Beneficial Bacteria:** Significant increases in oral health-related bacteria, specifically *Neisseria* (including unclassified Neisseria) and *Rothia*, after 5 and 9 hours of nitrate exposure.
*   **Detrimental Bacteria:** Significant reductions in bacteria linked with caries and halitosis, including *Streptococcus*, *Veillonella*, *Porphyromonas*, *Fusobacteria*, and *Leptotrichia*, after nitrate exposure.
*   **Trend for other pathogens:** *Tannerella* and *Treponema*, while not significantly decreased, showed a downward trend after nitrate exposure.

This evidence suggests that increasing nitrate levels can optimize the oral microbiome by boosting beneficial bacteria and reducing harmful ones.

Although a high dietary intake of nitrate is beneficial, targeted supplementation with potassium nitrate in a mouthwash may be considered, especially if dietary intake is already high.

### Mouthwash Usage Frequency Protocol

Analysis of salivary nitrate levels after exposure shows:
*   Immediately after nitrate exposure: High concentration of nitrate.
*   After 5 hours: Almost all nitrate consumed by nitrate-reducing bacteria (e.g., *Neisseria*, *Rothia*), converted to nitrite.
*   After 9 hours: No nitrate remaining.

This suggests that the mouthwash should be used **once every five hours** to maintain consistent nitrate levels. It is also crucial **not to rinse** after using the mouthwash, as rinsing would wash away the nitrate, Xylitol, and other beneficial components, preventing their prebiotic and therapeutic effects. Instead, use the mouthwash and then spit.

## Conclusion

By employing strategies like Xylitol for caries prevention, Sodium Bicarbonate for pH regulation, Peppermint Oil for pathogen inhibition, and Nitrate as a prebiotic, it is possible to cultivate a more balanced and healthy oral microbiome. While current research on oral microbiome interventions is limited, available data supports these targeted approaches for reducing detrimental bacteria and fostering beneficial ones.
