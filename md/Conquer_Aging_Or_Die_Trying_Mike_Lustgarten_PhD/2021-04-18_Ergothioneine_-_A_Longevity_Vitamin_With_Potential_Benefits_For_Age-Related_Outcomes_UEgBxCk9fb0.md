# 2021-04-18 Ergothioneine - A Longevity Vitamin With Potential Benefits For Age-Related Outcomes

### Executive Summary
*   Ergothioneine, a sulfur-containing antioxidant, is considered a 'longevity vitamin' because mammals do not synthesize it and must obtain it from their diet.
*   Plasma ergothioneine levels decline with age and are consistently lower in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), frailty, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality.
*   Mushrooms are a notably rich dietary source of ergothioneine, and higher mushroom consumption correlates with elevated blood ergothioneine levels.
*   Certain gut bacteria, specifically *Lactobacillus reuteri*, produce and release ergothioneine, suggesting the gut microbiome's role in systemic ergothioneine levels.
*   Increasing dietary intake of ergothioneine-rich foods (e.g., mushrooms) or supporting *Lactobacillus reuteri* levels may be strategies to boost ergothioneine and potentially mitigate age-related health decline, though randomized controlled trials are needed.

## Introduction to Ergothioneine

Beyond well-known antioxidants like glutathione, alpha lipoic acid, allicin (found in garlic), and sulforaphane (found in broccoli), another sulfur-containing antioxidant, ergothioneine, holds significant health importance. Ergothioneine has been dubbed a "longevity vitamin" because mammals lack the ability to synthesize it, necessitating dietary intake for adequate levels.

## Age-Related Decline and Health Associations

Ergothioneine levels are crucial for health, as they decline with age and lower levels are associated with increased incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

*   **Age-Related Decline:** Plasma ergothioneine levels clearly decline with age.
*   **Cognitive Impairment:** Cognitively normal individuals exhibit higher plasma ergothioneine levels compared to those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
*   **Frailty:** Non-frail individuals possess higher blood ergothioneine levels than frail individuals.
*   **Cardiovascular Disease and Mortality:** Higher blood ergothioneine levels are associated with a reduced risk of coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis), cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, and all-cause mortality. Hazard ratios for these outcomes were consistently below one, indicating a protective association for higher ergothioneine levels.

## Dietary Sources of Ergothioneine

Given that mammals cannot synthesize ergothioneine, diet plays a critical role in maintaining adequate blood levels.

*   **Food Sources (mg ergothioneine per kg dry weight):**
    *   Oats: ~2 mg
    *   Kidney Beans: ~2 mg
    *   Oat Bran: ~4 mg
    *   Chicken Liver: ~40 mg
    *   Tempeh: ~201 mg
    *   White Button Mushrooms: 630 mg
    *   Gray Oyster Mushrooms: 1300 mg (1.3 grams)
*   Mushrooms are an exceptionally rich source of ergothioneine, with some species containing over 300 mg per kilogram dry weight. Garlic and Mexican asparagus also contain decent amounts, while white asparagus contains significantly lower levels.
*   **Mushroom Consumption and Blood Levels:** Self-reported mushroom consumption correlates positively with whole blood ergothioneine levels; individuals reporting higher mushroom intake exhibited significantly higher blood levels.
*   **MCI and Mushroom Intake:** Interestingly, studies found no significant difference in mushroom consumption between MCI patients and cognitively normal subjects, suggesting that dietary intake alone may not fully explain lower ergothioneine levels in MCI.

## Gut Microbiome and Ergothioneine Production

Since dietary intake doesn't fully explain ergothioneine levels in conditions like MCI, other factors, such as the gut microbiome, may contribute.

*   **Lactobacillus reuteri Correlation:** Research indicates a strong positive correlation between fecal levels of ergothioneine and the bacterium *Lactobacillus reuteri* (correlation coefficient 0.83).
*   **Direct Production Evidence:** Cell culture experiments provide direct evidence that *Lactobacillus reuteri* produces and releases ergothioneine:
    *   *Lactobacillus reuteri* strains contained approximately threefold higher intracellular ergothioneine levels compared to *E. coli*.
    *   While *E. coli* showed no extracellular release of ergothioneine, four out of six *Lactobacillus reuteri* strains released significant amounts into the cell culture medium.
    *   Two *Lactobacillus reuteri* strains were particularly efficient, releasing four to fivefold more ergothioneine than the negative control.

## Hypothesis and Future Directions

The observed decline in blood ergothioneine during aging could stem from dietary insufficiency or an age-related decline in ergothioneine-producing gut bacteria like *Lactobacillus reuteri*.

### Proposed Pathway for Ergothioneine and Health:

Increased Mushroom/Ergothioneine-Rich Food Intake
OR
Increased *Lactobacillus reuteri* Levels (e.g., via supplementation or kefir consumption)
**->** Higher Blood Ergothioneine Levels
**->** Reduced Risk for Cognitive Impairment, Frailty, Atherosclerosis, Cardiovascular Disease Mortality, and All-Cause Mortality

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to formally test this hypothesis and investigate the efficacy of dietary or microbial interventions on ergothioneine levels and age-related health outcomes. This is an emerging field with promising avenues for research.
