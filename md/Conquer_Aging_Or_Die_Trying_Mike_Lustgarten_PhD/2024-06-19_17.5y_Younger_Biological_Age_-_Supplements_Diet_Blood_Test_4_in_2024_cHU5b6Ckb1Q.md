# 2024-06-19 17.5y Younger Biological Age - Supplements Diet Blood Test 4 in 2024

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age was 17.5 years younger than chronological age based on PhenoAge for blood test #4 in 2024.
*   Increased alfalfa sprout intake to 147g/day was an experimental change aimed at improving biological age, inspired by a previous test showing a 19-year younger age with higher intake.
*   Dietary fat intake was intentionally increased to 93g/day (39% of calories) to test LDL correlation with Dunedin PACE, but LDL remained high within range and did not increase further. Future plans include reducing fat to 85g/day due to its correlation with an older epigenetic age and higher glucose in personal data.
*   Selenium intake was targeted for an increase to 400 mcg/day (achieved in the latter half of the test period) by increasing Brazil nuts, aiming to improve the conversion of Free T4 to Free T3.
*   Total fructose intake reached its lowest point since tracking began in 2015 at 56g/day, which is a conscious effort given its correlation with negative biomarkers in personal data.

## Prescription Medications

*   **Levothyroxine:** Taken daily for hypothyroidism, diagnosed in mid-twenties.

## Supplements Protocol

*   **Vitamin D:** 1000 IU/day during non-summer months (29 out of 29 days corresponding to this test period).
*   **Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs - Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine):** 5g/day for the last 14 days of the test period.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Higher protein intake correlates with lower homocysteine.
    *   **Result:** No impact on homocysteine in this data.
*   **Nicotinic Acid:** Taken on only 1 of 29 days during this test period. Typically used to maintain NAD levels around 40 micromolar. Future tests will explore trigonelline as a supplement to impact NAD.

## Diet Composition (29-Day Average)

The diet aims to improve specific biomarkers (Horvath's epigenetic age, homocysteine, DHEA sulfate, thyroid hormones) without disrupting overall youthful biomarker data.

### Dietary Changes and Experiments

*   **Alfalfa Sprouts:** Increased to 147g/day (compared to 69g/day for test #3 and 120g/day for test #2, which yielded a 19-year younger biological age).
*   **Clover Sprouts:** Decreased to 30g/day (from 73g/day). This reduction was based on prior experiments showing no impact on NAD levels.
*   **Chickpeas:** Doubled to 243g/day (from 22g/day), returning to levels consumed during test #2.
*   **Eggs:** Reduced intake. Previous intake was increased to push LDL higher for an LDL/Dunedin PACE experiment, but LDL did not increase beyond a high-normal range. Max intake was 5 eggs/day.
*   **Peanuts:** Increased to 32g/day (from 24g/day).
    *   **Reasons:**
        *   Source of tryptophan betaine (trimethyltryptophan), a potential methyl donor (however, no impact on homocysteine observed).
        *   Rich source of lignoceric acid (C24 saturated fatty acid), which has been associated with reduced brain aging. Maintaining relatively high levels is a goal.
*   **Olives:** Increased intake from 2-3g/day to an average of 23g/day (a 7x increase). This is an ongoing experiment to observe the impact on biomarkers, as whole olives are preferred over processed olive oil.
*   **Serrano/Fresno Peppers:** Increased to 10g/day (from 1g/day) as spicy foods have been associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Foods Removed for This Test:** Cinnamon, cloves, oats, and onion. These may be reintroduced in smaller amounts for future tests as test #3 (when they were reduced/removed) showed slightly worse biological age data.
*   **"Cheat Meals":** Two days included increased intake of coconut butter and cacao beans with added glucose.
    *   Sugar from these days contributed 213 calories to the 29-day period, representing 0.3% of total calories. The diet was 99.7% clean.

### Top Calorie Contributors

Sardines consistently remained the top food for daily calorie intake. Nine of the top 10 calorie-contributing foods were consistent with test #3. Brazil nut intake increased to enhance dietary selenium for thyroid hormone regulation.

## Macronutrients

*   **Calorie Intake:** Average 2118 kcal/day. This marks the first increase in daily calorie intake in three years, following 21 consecutive tests with reduced intake. Current daily intake is slightly above 2118 kcal/day for future tests, influenced by SHBG, free testosterone, red blood cells, hemoglobin, and the free T3:Free T4 ratio.
*   **Protein Intake:** Average 105g/day (approximately 20% of total calories), including BCAAs.
*   **Fat Intake:** Average 93g/day (approximately 39% of total calories). This was a small increase from test #3's 90g/day.
    *   **Experiment:** This increase was an attempt to raise LDL for the Dunedin PACE experiment. However, LDL remained on the high end of the personal range and did not increase further.
    *   **Future Plans:** Fat intake will be reduced to approximately 85g/day for the next test. In personal data, higher fat intake correlates with an older epigenetic age (Horvath) and higher glucose levels (one reading was 98 mg/dL).
    *   **Fat Composition:** Omega-3 and Omega-6 levels were held constant. Saturated fat was slightly reduced, and monounsaturated fat was increased. Future tests will further reduce saturated fat and increase monounsaturated fat (from sources like peanuts and macadamia nuts, while reducing coconut butter) to assess biomarker impact, particularly on Horvath's epigenetic age and glucose.
*   **Carbohydrate Intake:**
    *   Total Carbs: 259g/day.
    *   Fiber: 88g/day.
        *   Approximately 20% of fiber is soluble, fermenting into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). This translates to about 180 calories from fiber being converted into fats by gut bacteria.
    *   Net Carbs: 172g/day (Total Carbs - Fiber). This constitutes 32% of the total diet.
*   **Net Macronutrient Distribution:**
    *   Fat: 48% (39% dietary fat + 8.5% from soluble fiber conversion)
    *   Net Carbs: 32%
    *   Protein: 20%
*   **Fructose Intake:** Total fructose intake was 56g/day (sucrose is half fructose, added to total fructose). This is the lowest fructose intake since tracking began in 2015 (previous low was 57g/day). Fructose in personal data is correlated with more negative biomarker trends. Reducing fructose further is challenging due to fruit's role in satiety and calorie restriction goals.

## Micronutrients

### Vitamins

*   All RDAs for vitamins were met, with the exception of choline, which reached the RDA target when choline from sardines (not fully captured by Cronometer) was accounted for.
*   Many micronutrients are purposely consumed at levels higher than RDA, guided by their correlations with a panel of at least 25 biomarkers, including epigenetics and metabolomics data.
*   **Vitamin K:** 2500 micrograms/day. This level has been gradually titrated upwards over several years based on consistent positive correlations with biomarkers related to aging and all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Niacin:** Intake was lower due to the removal of nicotinic acid supplementation for 28 of 29 days.
*   **Vitamin B12:** Intake was lower due to the removal of supplementation during the BCAA/homocysteine experiment.

### Minerals

*   Mineral intake was largely consistent with test #3, with the exception of selenium.
*   **Selenium:** Increased by 60 micrograms due to increased Brazil nut intake during the latter half of the 29-day period.
    *   **Target:** 400 micrograms/day for the next test period.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Selenium is required for the conversion of Free T4 (thyroxine) to Free T3 (triiodothyronine). The goal is to increase the Free T3:Free T4 ratio.
    *   **Future Considerations:** If selenium alone is insufficient, the combination with coenzyme Q10 may be explored, as indicated by published data.
