# 2023-07-11 Grape Seed Proanthocyanidins Did Not Raise NAD Test Results

## Executive Summary
*   A rat study showed that grape seed proanthocyanidins, at 50 mg/kg, increased liver NAD levels by approximately four-fold.
*   In a study on middle-aged mice (18 months old) fed grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE), plasma NAD levels increased approximately three-fold.
*   A human self-experiment with 6.1 grams/day of grape seed powder (minimum 648 mg proanthocyanidins) for 19 days did not raise NAD levels; the recorded NAD level of 19.9 micromolar was the lowest observed across six tests.
*   The human equivalent dose (HED) for the rat study's NAD increase was estimated at 536 mg of grape seed proanthocyanidins, a dose that was met or exceeded in the human self-experiment without observing any increase in NAD.

## Rat Data
Grape seed proanthocyanidins increased NAD levels. In a rat study, the highest proanthocyanidin content of 50 mg/kg increased liver NAD levels by approximately four-fold.

## Mouse Data
In a study involving middle-aged mice (18 months old) fed grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE), plasma NAD levels increased approximately three-fold.

## Human Self-Experiment
No human studies have yet tested the ability of grape seed proanthocyanidins to impact NAD levels. A self-experiment (NAD test number six) investigated whether supplementing with grape seed powder as a source of proanthocyanidins would raise NAD levels. The results indicated that grape seed powder did not raise NAD; the recorded NAD level was 19.9 micromolar, which was the lowest reading across six tests.

### Protocol:
*   **Supplement:** Grape seed powder (source of proanthocyanidins)
*   **Dose:** 6.1 grams per day
*   **Duration:** 19 days
*   **Estimated Proanthocyanidin Intake:** Minimum 648 mg/day (calculated based on a lowest published content of 107 mg per gram of grape seed).
*   **Measurement:** Blood NAD analysis by Ginfinity.

The human equivalent dose (HED) for the rat study's four-fold increase in NAD was approximately 536 mg of grape seed proanthocyanidins. Despite exceeding this dose in the self-experiment, no increase in NAD was observed.

## Future Research
The next self-experiment will investigate the impact of niacin on NAD levels.
