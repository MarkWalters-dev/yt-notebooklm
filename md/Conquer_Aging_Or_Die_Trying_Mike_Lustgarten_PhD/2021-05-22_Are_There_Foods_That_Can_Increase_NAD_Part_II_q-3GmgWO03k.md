# 2021-05-22 Are There Foods That Can Increase NAD Part II

### Executive Summary

*   CD38 is an NADase (NAD-degrading enzyme) that increases with aging, contributing to the age-related decline in NAD levels.
*   In vitro studies show that luteolinidin, coumarinin, and luteolin are more potent CD38 inhibitors (requiring lower concentrations for 50% inhibition) compared to apigenin and quercetin.
*   Foods rich in these potent inhibitors include black elderberries and blackberries (coumarinin), dried Mexican oregano, celery seeds, and radicchio (luteolin), and black sorghum (luteolinidin).
*   Experimental evidence suggests coumarinin can prevent NAD decline in differentiating cells, and luteolinidin can increase NAD levels in rat hearts exposed to ischemia/reperfusion.
*   Currently, there are no human randomized controlled trials to determine the effective dietary intake of these foods for increasing NAD levels in people, and absorption rates may vary.

## NAD and CD38 Activity

NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) impacts the health and function of many organ systems, but its levels decline during aging. One contributing factor to this decline is the enzyme CD38. CD38 is an NADase, meaning it degrades NAD.

The activity of CD38 increases during aging. This leads to a process where:

`Aging -> Increased CD38 activity -> NAD degradation -> Decreased NAD levels`

One strategy to increase NAD is to include foods containing CD38 inhibitors.

## Flavonoid CD38 Inhibitors: Potency Comparison

Beyond previously discussed inhibitors like apigenin and quercetin, other flavonoids, including luteolinidin, coumarinin, and luteolin, also act as CD38 inhibitors.

To compare their effectiveness, studies measure the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). The IC50 is the amount of a substance needed to inhibit CD38 activity by 50%. A lower IC50 value indicates a more potent inhibitor, meaning less of the substance is needed to achieve 50% inhibition.

### Comparison against Quercetin

In one study, the IC50 values for inhibiting human CD38 activity were:
*   **Luteolinidin:** 6-8 micromolar
*   **Coumarinin:** 6-8 micromolar
*   **Luteolin:** 6-8 micromolar
*   **Quercetin:** approximately 38 micromolar

This indicates that luteolinidin and coumarinin are about six times more effective at inhibiting CD38 than quercetin, while luteolin is about four to five times more effective. Another study examining quercetin's IC50 reported it to be around 13 micromolar, which, while lower, is still higher than the values observed for luteolinidin, coumarinin, and luteolin.

### Comparison against Apigenin

In a separate analysis, apigenin's IC50 for inhibiting CD38 was found to be approximately 12 micromolar.

Based on these studies, luteolinidin, coumarinin, and luteolin consistently demonstrate lower IC50 values, making them more potent inhibitors of CD38 compared to both apigenin and quercetin.

## Foods Containing Key Flavonoids

### Coumarinin

Coumarinin is most abundant in:
*   **Black elderberries:** Approximately 740 mg per 100 grams of fresh weight.
*   **Blackberries:** Approximately 140 mg per 100 grams of fresh weight.

### Luteolin

Luteolin is found in:
*   **Dried Mexican oregano:** Approximately 11 milligrams per gram.
*   **Celery seeds:** Approximately 7.6 milligrams per gram.
*   **Radicchio:** Approximately 0.38 milligrams per gram. Although radicchio has a lower concentration per gram, larger quantities can be consumed to achieve similar luteolin intake to celery seeds or dried Mexican oregano (e.g., 20 grams of radicchio yields about 7.6 mg).

### Luteolinidin

Luteolinidin is found in:
*   **Black sorghum:** An average concentration of 167 milligrams per gram across various black sorghum varieties.
    *   It is important to note that red sorghum varieties often contain significantly lower amounts or no luteolinidin. Black sorghum can be challenging to source.

## Impact on NAD Levels

### Coumarinin and NAD

An in vitro study examined intracellular NAD concentration in cells induced to differentiate.
*   Differentiation typically led to a decline in NAD levels after six hours.
*   However, cells treated with coumarinin showed no decrease in NAD levels and, in fact, a small increase, suggesting that coumarinin's CD38 inhibitory action may lead to higher NAD.

### Luteolin and NAD

No studies have yet explored the direct impact of luteolin on NAD levels.

### Luteolinidin and NAD

An ex vivo study using rat hearts investigated the impact of luteolinidin on NAD/NADH levels under stress conditions (ischemia-reperfusion, IR).
*   Control rat hearts showed stable NAD levels.
*   Rat hearts exposed to IR experienced a significant decline in NAD, approximately 50%.
*   However, rat hearts exposed to IR and supplemented with luteolinidin in the media showed increased NAD levels compared to IR alone.
This suggests that luteolinidin can help maintain or increase NAD levels under challenging conditions.

## Human Relevance

The exact amount of these foods that should be consumed to inhibit CD38 and maximize NAD in humans remains unknown.
*   There are currently no human randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have explored the impact of these specific foods on NAD levels in people.
*   Factors such as absorption rates and individual variations will likely influence the effectiveness of dietary intake.

Despite the lack of human RCTs, a strategy that incorporates foods containing these potent CD38 inhibitors (luteolinidin, coumarinin, and luteolin) may help attenuate the age-related decline in NAD levels.
