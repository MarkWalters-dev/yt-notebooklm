# 2025-12-14 Using Correlations To Improve Biomarkers Test 7 In 2025

## Executive Summary
*   The latest blood test (Test 7 in 2025) resulted in a biological age of 37.5 years using the Fenohage calculator (Dr. Morgan LaVine's method), marking a difference of 15.7 years younger than chronological age.
*   The annualized pace of aging (average biological age from 44 tests since 2018) is 33.7 years in 2025, showing a resistance to expected age-related biological increases (expected age for 2025: 39.7 years).
*   Glucose levels are identified as a major weak spot, registering the highest value ever (102 mg/dL) across 63 tests, and four recent results have fallen outside the optimal range (80–94 mg/dL).
*   Data analysis confirms a significant positive correlation between glucose levels and chronological age ($r=0.33, p=0.008$), indicating an inability to resist age-related glucose increases.

## Biological Age Assessment (Fenohage Calculator)
The most recent blood test (Test 7, 2025) was processed using Dr. Morgan LaVine's biological age calculator, Fenohage, based on nine component biomarkers.

*   **Result:** Biological Age of 37.5 years.
*   **Advantage:** 15.7 years younger than chronological age.
*   **Current Focus:** While MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume) was noted to have worsened since the previous test, the current focus for improvement is glucose management.

## Analysis of Pace of Aging (2018–2025)
Forty-four blood tests collected since 2018 are used to calculate the net pace of aging, aiming to resist the natural increase of 0.9 years in biological age for every year of chronological aging.

| Year | Testing Frequency (Tests/Year) | Average Biological Age (Years) | Assessment vs. Expected |
| :--- | :----------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| 2018–2019 | 3 tests over 2 years | 34.3 | N/A |
| 2020 | 6 tests | 33.9 | N/A |
| 2021 | 6 tests | 33.9 | N/A |
| 2022 | 7 tests | 32.1 (Best Data) | N/A |
| 2023 | 7 tests | 32.9 | N/A |
| 2024 | 8 tests | 33.1 | N/A |
| 2025 (YTD) | 7 tests (ongoing) | 33.7 | Currently 6 years below expected age (39.7) |

**Pace of Aging Findings:**
*   **Good News:** The current overall average biological age (33.7 years in 2025) shows a six-year reduction compared to the expected age (39.7 years) based on the 0.9 years/year aging rate defined by the biomarker panel.
*   **Bad News:** The last six tests in 2025 have trended negatively.
*   **2022 Baseline Comparison:** Starting from the best data in 2022 (32.1 years), the trend line indicates an age-related biological increase. However, the expected age calculation starting from 2022 projects an expected age of 34.8 years for 2025, meaning the current average (33.7 years) is still one year below this specific projection.

## Deep Dive: Glucose Management

Fasting blood glucose is identified as a critical weak spot, with the most recent reading being 102 mg/dL, the highest across 63 tests dating back to 2015.

### Optimal Range & Age Correlation
*   **Literature Optimal Range (Fasting Glucose):** 80 mg/dL to 94 mg/dL.
*   **Historical Average (63 Tests):** 90 mg/dL (technically within optimal range).
*   **Age Correlation:** A significant positive correlation exists between glucose readings and chronological age ($r=0.33$, $p=0.008$). This indicates that the subject has been unable to resist the expected age-related increase in glucose levels over time.
*   **Current Status:** Four of the most recent tests have moved outside the optimal range of 80–94 mg/dL, necessitating immediate intervention to reverse the trend.

### Methodology for Correlation Analysis
Dietary intake data is rigorously matched against blood test results to identify correlations.

**Data Collection Protocol:**
1.  Weigh nearly all food consumed using a food scale since 2015.
2.  Enter daily intake data into the Cronometer tracking application.
3.  Pull Cronometer data into a spreadsheet.
4.  Calculate the average dietary intake over the period leading up to each blood test (e.g., average intake over the 50 days preceding the test).
5.  Correlate this average dietary intake with the corresponding blood test results.

The analysis focuses on correlation coefficients ($r$) and P-values ($p$), using a strict significance threshold of $p < 0.005$. The top correlations (those with $p < 0.01$) link specific dietary components to glucose variability.
