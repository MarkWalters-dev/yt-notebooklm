# 2022-09-04 Quantifying Biological Age - Blood Test 5 in 2022

## Executive Summary

*   The speaker's biological age, calculated using Dr. Morgan Levine's phenotypic age, is 34 years, which is 15.6 years younger than chronological age. The average for 2022 thus far is 33.9 years, showing a borderline statistically significant reduction (p=0.05) compared to 2021.
*   Levine's phenotypic age demonstrates a strong correlation with chronological age (r=0.94-0.96 across two studies, N > 10,000 each) and is associated with a 9% increased all-cause mortality risk for every one-year increase in biological age. It predicts increased mortality risk across various age groups and from heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease, kidney issues, and COVID-19.
*   The speaker's biological age, calculated using Aging.ai 3.0, is 31 years, 18.6 years younger than chronological age. This age has consistently remained in the 29-32 year range since 2009 across 35 blood tests.
*   Aging.ai 3.0, utilizing 19 standard blood biomarkers, shows a correlation of 0.8 with chronological age and is validated to predict all-cause mortality risk, with younger biological ages associated with reduced risk and older ages with increased risk (replicated in Canadian and US cohorts).
*   Identified areas for potential improvement or further investigation in personal data include creatinine levels (1.04 mg/dL) and the complex role of total cholesterol in age-related changes and all-cause mortality, which involves DHEA sulfate, testosterone, and cortisol.

## Levine's Phenotypic Age

Dr. Morgan Levine's phenotypic age calculator uses nine biomarkers to estimate biological age.

### Personal Biological Age Data (2022)

*   **Current Biological Age:** 34 years (15.6 years younger than chronological age).
    *   *Note:* High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was indicated as `< 0.3 mg/L`, potentially leading to a slightly lower biological age if a more precise value were available.
*   **Historical Trends (2018-2022):**
    *   **2018-2019 (3 tests):** Average Levine biological age: 36.1 years.
    *   **2020 (6 tests):** Average Levine biological age: 35.6 years.
    *   **2021 (6 tests):** Average Levine biological age: 35.6 years.
    *   **2022 (5 tests to date):** Average Levine biological age: 33.9 years.
*   **Statistical Significance:** A two-sample t-test comparing 2021 and 2022 average biological ages yields a p-value of 0.05, indicating a borderline statistically significant reduction.
*   **Chronological vs. Biological Age Difference:**
    *   **Prior to 2022 (15 tests):** Average reduction (chronological age - biological age): 11.9 years.
    *   **2022 (5 tests to date):** Average reduction: 15.3 years (consistently greater than 12 years in each test).

### Validation of Levine's Phenotypic Age

1.  **Correlation with Chronological Age:**
    *   **NHANES III (N ≈ 10,000):** Correlation = 0.94.
    *   **NHANES IV (N ≈ 11,000):** Correlation = 0.96.
    *   This correlation is comparable to the Horvath epigenetic clock, which also shows a strong correlation of 0.94 with chronological age across various tissues and cell types.

2.  **Association with All-Cause Mortality Risk:**
    *   A study including over 11,000 people found that for every one-year increase in biological age (using Levine's test), all-cause mortality risk increased by 9% (Hazard Ratio = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.08-1.10). This effect was statistically significant (CI above 1).
    *   This association was consistent across age groups:
        *   **Young Adults:** 13% increased risk.
        *   **Middle-Aged Adults:** 10% increased risk.
        *   **Older Adults:** 8% increased risk.

3.  **Association with Disease-Specific Mortality:**
    *   **Increased Risk For:** Heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease, and kidney issues (nephritis/nephrosis).
    *   **No Association With:** Cerebrovascular disease, diabetes-related mortality, influenza, or pneumonia.
    *   **COVID-19 Mortality:** An older biological age (more than a decade prior to the pandemic) was associated with an increased mortality risk in COVID-19 patients.

## Aging.ai Biological Age

Aging.ai is another blood-based biomarker panel that assesses biological age. It is free to use and does not include chronological age in its model. The data discussed refers to Aging.ai 3.0.

### Test Components and Cost

*   **Biomarkers:** 19 input parameters, commonly found on standard chemistry panels and complete blood count (CBC).
*   **Cost:** Approximately $35 USD for the standard chemistry panel and CBC. If high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) is included (as for Levine's test), the total cost is around $80 USD.

### Personal Biological Age Data (2022)

*   **Current Biological Age:** 31 years (18.6 years younger than chronological age). This is calculated using the North American dataset for consistency.
*   **Historical Trends (2009-2022):**
    *   **2009-2013 (3 tests):** Average Aging.ai age: 32 years.
    *   **2016-2021 (27 tests):** Average Aging.ai age: 29.9 years.
        *   *Note on Protocol (2016 onwards):* Blood test kits were mailed, then taken to a lab (Quest or LabCorp) for blood draw and analysis, bypassing direct doctor visits for testing.
    *   **2022 (5 tests to date):** Average Aging.ai age: 29 years.
*   **Consistency:** The Aging.ai age has consistently remained in the 29-32 year range, regardless of chronological age during these periods.

### Validation of Aging.ai

1.  **Correlation with Chronological Age:**
    *   Aging.ai 3.0 has a correlation of 0.8 with chronological age.
    *   This is stronger than some other epigenetic clocks, such as Hannem's test (r=0.68).

2.  **Association with All-Cause Mortality Risk:**
    *   **Canadian Cohort:** Individuals with Aging.ai ages more than five years older than their chronological age showed an increased all-cause mortality risk. Conversely, those with Aging.ai ages more than five years younger than their chronological age had a significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **US Cohort (NHANES):** These findings were replicated, showing increased all-cause mortality risk for older biological ages and decreased risk for younger biological ages.

## Limitations and Future Investigations

*   **Creatinine:** A creatinine level of 1.04 mg/dL is noted as a potential area for improvement, considered an "easy fix."
*   **Total Cholesterol:** The role of total cholesterol in all-cause mortality risk and age-related changes is identified as a complex area. Future investigation will explore its relationship with DHEA sulfate, testosterone, and cortisol.
*   **Oral Microbiome:** Analysis of a second oral microbiome sample is pending, following previous research on biohacking the oral microbiome.
