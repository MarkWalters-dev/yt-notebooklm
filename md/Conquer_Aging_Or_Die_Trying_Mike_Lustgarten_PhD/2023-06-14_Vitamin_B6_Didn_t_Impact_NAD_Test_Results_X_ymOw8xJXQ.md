# 2023-06-14 Vitamin B6 Didn't Impact NAD Test Results

## Executive Summary

*   Increasing average daily Vitamin B6 intake from 3.2 mg to 11.3 mg (approximately 3.5-fold increase) did not significantly alter NAD levels compared to baseline.
*   A further three-fold increase in average daily Vitamin B6 intake to 37.2 mg resulted in a decrease in NAD levels.
*   These findings suggest that Vitamin B6 supplementation, at these doses and over these timeframes, did not increase NAD levels in the individual tested.
*   Age-related increases in Quinolinic acid may indicate a potential bottleneck in NAD synthesis beyond Vitamin B6 availability.

## NAD Test Results and Vitamin B6 Intake

### NAD Test Number 4

*   **Average B6 Intake:** 11.3 mg/day
*   **NAD Level:** 30.1 micromolar
*   **Comparison to Previous Tests:** Higher than Test 1 (25.6 micromolar) and Test 2 (25.3 micromolar).
*   **B6 Intake Comparison:** Significantly higher (approximately 3.5-fold increase) than the 3.2 mg/day intake during Tests 1 and 2.

### NAD Test Number 5

*   **Average B6 Intake:** 37.2 mg/day (approximately 3x higher than Test 4, or ~11.6x higher than Tests 1 & 2)
*   **NAD Level:** 22.3 micromolar
*   **Outcome:** This was the lowest NAD level recorded across five tests.
*   **Conclusion:** A further three-fold increase in Vitamin B6 intake did not increase NAD levels and, in this case, led to a decrease. Vitamin B6 did not appear to increase NAD levels in the individual over the period of Tests 4 and 5.

## Potential Age-Related Bottlenecks in NAD Synthesis

*   Age-related decline in Vitamin B6 (pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, P5P) may limit the conversion of tryptophan into NAD.
*   Kynurenine levels increase during aging, correlating with the age-related decline in NAD.
*   Quinolinic acid levels increase during aging, suggesting it may be an age-related block in the NAD synthesis pathway.
*   Future research may focus on the conversion of Quinolinic acid to NAD, which involves compounds like grape seed proanthocyanidin extract.
