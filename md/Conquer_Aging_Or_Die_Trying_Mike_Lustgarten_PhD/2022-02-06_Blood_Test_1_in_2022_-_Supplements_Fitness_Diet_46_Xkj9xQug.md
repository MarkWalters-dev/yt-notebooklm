# 2022-02-06 Blood Test 1 in 2022 - Supplements Fitness Diet

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age assessments (Phenotypic Age and Aging.ai) showed a significant reduction, indicating a potential rejuvenation of 4 years beyond the average reduction observed previously.
*   A decrease in average daily calorie intake was observed between the two testing periods, with a 51-calorie reduction.
*   Reduced fat intake, particularly monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and saturated fatty acids (SFAs), was correlated with improvements in several blood biomarkers, including glucose, LDL, and platelets.
*   Increases in omega-3 fatty acid intake were correlated with lower creatinine levels.
*   Reductions in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), saturated fatty acids (SFAs), protein, beta-carotene, and calcium intake were all significantly correlated with lower glucose levels.

## Supplements

*   **Levothyroxine:** Daily dosage of 137.5 micrograms.
*   **Methyl B12:** 1000 micrograms every three days (did not impact homocysteine levels).
*   **Melatonin (Middle of the Night):** 100-200 micrograms per day for the 10 days leading up to the blood test, used to address nighttime awakenings.

## Fitness

### Cardiovascular Metrics

*   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):**
    *   Average HRV for Test #6 (2021): 50.3 milliseconds.
    *   Average HRV for Test #1 (2022): 50.9 milliseconds.
    *   No significant difference found between the two periods.
    *   Immune activation (e.g., vaccine booster) significantly reduced HRV (approx. 30% reduction observed on vaccine night).
*   **Resting Heart Rate:**
    *   Average Resting Heart Rate for Test #6 (2021): 47.2 beats per minute.
    *   Average Resting Heart Rate for Test #1 (2022): 46.8 beats per minute.
    *   No significant difference found between the two periods.
    *   Immune activation (e.g., vaccine booster) increased resting heart rate (outlier of 60 bpm the night after booster).

**Conclusion on Cardiovascular Metrics:** No significant improvement in HRV or resting heart rate was observed between the two test periods, suggesting this was not the primary driver for the biological age reduction.

### Body Weight

*   Average Body Weight for Test #6 (2021): 155 pounds.
*   Average Body Weight for Test #1 (2022): 154 pounds.
*   A statistically significant reduction in body weight was observed for Test #1 (2022).

### Physical Activity

*   **Metric Used:** Average daily heart rate (as a proxy for physical activity intensity).
*   Average Daily Heart Rate for Test #6 (2021): 57.7 beats per minute.
*   Average Daily Heart Rate for Test #1 (2022): 57 beats per minute.
*   The difference was not statistically significant (p=0.08), indicating no substantial change in physical activity levels.

## Diet

### Calorie Intake

*   Average Daily Calorie Intake for Test #6 (2021): 2373 calories.
*   Average Daily Calorie Intake for Test #1 (2022): 2322 calories.
*   A statistically significant reduction in calorie intake was observed for Test #1 (2022).

**Correlation Analysis:**
*   A relatively higher calorie intake was significantly correlated with higher triglycerides, platelets, RDW, and LDL.
*   A 51-calorie cut test-to-test coincided with improvements in these four biomarkers.

### Macronutrient Composition

#### Fat Intake

*   Average Daily Fat Intake for Test #6 (2021): 94 grams.
*   Average Daily Fat Intake for Test #1 (2022): 84 grams.
*   A statistically significant reduction in fat intake was observed.

**Impact on Biomarkers:**
*   Reduced fat intake correlated with improvements in:
    *   Red blood cells
    *   Glucose
    *   LDL
    *   Platelets

**Fat Subtypes:**
*   **Monounsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFAs):** Significant reduction from 24g/day to 16g/day.
    *   **Reason for Reduction:** Higher MUFA intake was significantly correlated with higher glucose levels.
*   **Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs):** No significant difference in total PUFA intake.
    *   **Omega-3:** Increased intake (via flaxseeds and sardines).
        *   **Correlation:** Higher omega-3 intake correlated with lower creatinine. Creatinine reduced from 1.02 to 0.94 mg/dL in Test #1 (2022).
    *   **Omega-6:** No significant difference in intake.
*   **Saturated Fatty Acids (SFAs):** No significant difference in total SFA intake.
    *   **Change in Source:** Reduced cheese intake (longer chain SFAs) and increased coconut butter (medium chain SFAs).
    *   **Reason for Cheese Reduction:** Full fat dairy (cheese and yogurt) is significantly correlated with higher glucose.

#### Protein Intake

*   Average Daily Protein Intake for Test #6 (2021): Reduced by 5.5 grams/day for Test #1 (2022).
*   **Reason for Reduction:** Higher protein intake is significantly correlated with higher glucose.

#### Carbohydrate Intake

*   **Total Carbohydrates:** Slightly higher intake (~10 grams/day) for Test #1 (2022), close to statistical significance.
    *   **Significance:** Higher carbohydrate intake from whole foods (grains, fruits, vegetables) is correlated with *lower* glucose in this data.
*   **Fiber:** No significant difference (86 grams/day).
*   **Total Fructose Intake:** Small reduction of 3.4 grams/day.
    *   **Reason for Reduction:** Higher fructose intake is correlated with lower HDL.
*   **Net Carbs:** Slightly higher intake (~10 grams/day) for Test #1 (2022), close to statistical significance.

### Vitamins

**Significantly Different Intakes:**

*   **Thiamine (B1):** Slightly higher intake in Test #1 (2022), likely due to increased barley and flaxseeds.
*   **Vitamin A:** Lower intake (approx. 5000 IU lower) in Test #1 (2022).
*   **Beta-Carotene:** Lower intake (approx. 2000 micrograms lower) in Test #1 (2022).
    *   **Reason for Reduction:** Higher beta-carotene intake is significantly correlated with higher glucose.
*   **Vitamin C:** Slightly higher intake in Test #1 (2022).
*   **Vitamin D:** Slightly higher intake in Test #1 (2022), likely due to increased sardines.

### Minerals

**Significantly Different Intakes:**

*   **Calcium:** Significantly lower intake in Test #1 (2022).
    *   **Reason for Reduction:** Purposely reduced by lowering cheese intake; higher calcium intake is correlated with higher glucose.
*   **Potassium:** Significantly reduced intake by 400 mg/day.
*   **Selenium:** Small increase of 13 micrograms/day (likely due to barley and sardines), partially offset by reduced Brazil nut intake.
*   **Zinc:** 2 mg lower intake.

### Overall Food Composition

**Key Food Differences:**

*   **Strawberries:** Increased intake in Test #1 (2022).
*   **Blackberries & Blueberries:** Decreased intake in Test #1 (2022).
*   **Carrots:** Reduced intake by ~20 grams/day to decrease beta-carotene.
*   **Corn:** Increased intake by ~30 grams/day to contribute to higher carbohydrate intake.
*   **Barley:** Increased intake to contribute to higher carbohydrate intake.
*   **Sardines:** Increased intake by ~20 grams/day to increase omega-3 intake.
*   **Coconut Butter:** Increased intake by ~15 grams/day.
*   **Avocado:** Significantly reduced intake.
*   **Cheese:** Significantly reduced intake from >50g/day to ~3g/day.

**"Junk" Food Intake:**
*   An outlier consumption of pizza occurred during the dietary period for Test #1 (2022) due to travel.
*   Nutella intake was consistent (average 4g/day), consumed on the first two days after each blood test.

**Other Notable Food Increases:**
*   **Flaxseeds:** Increased from 3g to 14g per day to boost omega-3 intake.
*   **Turmeric:** More than doubled from 0.7g to 1.8g per day.
    *   **Reason for Increase:** Higher turmeric intake is significantly correlated with lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). hs-CRP was below 0.3 mg/L for Test #1 (2022).
*   **Black Pepper:** Increased intake (0.5g/day), likely in conjunction with turmeric.
