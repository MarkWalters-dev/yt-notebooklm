# 2020-07-31 Biological Age Test 4 in 2020 - Getting Better or Getting Worse

## Executive Summary
*   Recent biological age testing shows an unexpected increase in phenotypic age, moving in the wrong direction despite dietary interventions.
*   Average daily fat intake, particularly saturated fat, is strongly correlated with increased plasma glucose levels.
*   Higher dietary fiber intake per calorie is significantly correlated with lower plasma glucose levels.
*   Daily yogurt intake is strongly correlated with higher glucose and creatinine levels, but also with higher red blood cell counts.
*   Seasonal allergies appear to be a significant contributor to elevated CRP levels during June and July.

## Previous 2020 Biological Age Tests
*   **February Test:** Phenotypic age was approximately 14 years younger than chronological age (around 33 years old). This test was affected by a respiratory infection.
*   **March Test:** Following recovery from the respiratory infection, biological age reduced by about one year. White blood cells decreased from 5.8 to 4.7, and lymphocyte percentage increased. Creatinine also decreased from 1.08 to 0.97.
*   **June Test:** Due to seasonal allergies (grass and pollen), this test showed a suboptimal result with a phenotypic age of approximately 34 years, still 13 years younger than chronological age, but the worst reading to date for 2020. Glucose and creatinine levels had been trending upwards for about 1.5 years.

## Dietary Interventions and Correlations

### Impact of Fat Intake on Biomarkers
*   **Correlation:** Average daily fat intake is strongly correlated (correlation coefficient 0.72) with plasma glucose levels. Higher fat intake is associated with higher glucose.
*   **Creatinine & White Blood Cells:** Higher daily fat intake is also positively correlated with increased creatinine and white blood cell counts, both considered undesirable trends with aging.
*   **Lymphocytes:** Higher daily fat intake is negatively correlated with lymphocyte percentage. Lower lymphocyte percentage is associated with aging.
*   **CRP:** Higher daily fat intake is correlated with lower levels of C-reactive protein (CRP).
*   **Saturated Fat:** The percentage of calories from saturated fat was significantly correlated with plasma glucose. Primary sources identified were coconut butter and cocoa beans.
*   **Intervention:** Reduced intake of cocoa beans and coconut butter.
    *   Cocoa bean intake reduced by 47%.
    *   Coconut butter intake reduced by approximately 50%.
    *   Total fat intake reduced by 12 grams/day (from ~93g to ~80g).
    *   Saturated fat intake reduced by 8 grams/day (22% cut).
*   **Expected Outcome:** Based on the trend line, a reduction in daily fat intake to ~80 grams was expected to lower plasma glucose levels to approximately 88 mg/dL.

### Impact of Fiber and Other Micronutrients on Glucose
*   **Fiber Density:** Higher dietary fiber intake per 100 calories (fiber density) is significantly correlated (correlation coefficient 0.62) with lower plasma glucose.
*   **Other Correlated Variables:**
    *   Higher Vitamin C intake correlated with lower glucose.
    *   More negative Potential Renal Acid Load (PRAL) correlated with lower glucose.
    *   Higher Potassium to Sodium ratio correlated with lower glucose.
*   **Intervention:** Added approximately 300 grams of broccoli per day. This intervention was aimed at positively affecting Vitamin C, PRAL, and the Potassium to Sodium ratio.
    *   Vitamin C intake increased by ~150 mg/day.
    *   Potassium to Sodium ratio increased by one unit.
    *   PRAL became more negative.
*   **Previous Broccoli Intake:** Broccoli intake had been reduced over the prior eight months, averaging 19 grams per day for the June test, and was increased to an average of 295 grams per day for the current test.

## Latest Biological Age Test (July 31, 2020) Results

*   **Phenotypic Age:** 37.65 years old (9.35 years younger than chronological age). This represents the worst reading in seven tests.
*   **Creatinine:** Remained too high, indicating no improvement from dietary changes.
*   **Glucose:** 99 mg/dL. This is the second 99 reading in 2020, indicating a worsening trend.
*   **CRP:** 1.01 mg/L. This is a 2.5-fold elevation compared to previous measurements since 2018.
    *   **Seasonal Allergy Influence:** CRP levels are consistently higher in June and July compared to other months, suggesting seasonal allergies significantly contribute to this elevation. Average CRP in June/July across 2018-2020 is double the average of other months.
*   **MCV and RDW:** Both are trending in the wrong direction. Lower levels of MCV and RDW are associated with biological youth and lower all-cause mortality risk.

## Overall 2020 Performance

*   **Average Phenotypic Age (2020):** 34 years old (13 years younger than chronological age). This is consistent with the previous year's average phenotypic age of 33.44 years in 2019.
*   **Aging Rate:** If the average phenotypic age of 34 is maintained for the rest of 2020, it suggests an aging rate of approximately 0.5-0.6 years for every chronological year passed.

## Planned Next Steps and Observations

### Yogurt Intake and its Impact
*   **Observation:** Glucose and creatinine levels are significantly higher when yogurt is included in the diet.
    *   Average glucose without yogurt: ~87 mg/dL.
    *   Average glucose with yogurt: ~95 mg/dL.
    *   Creatinine levels are also significantly lower without yogurt.
*   **Dilemma:** Yogurt intake is strongly correlated with increased red blood cell (RBC) counts.
    *   **Correlation (RBC vs. Yogurt):** Strong positive correlation (0.90).
    *   **RBC without Yogurt:** Range of 4.45 to 4.8.
    *   **RBC with Yogurt:** Never less than 5, even with moderate intake.
*   **Importance of RBCs:** Higher RBC counts are found in youth and decline with aging. RBCs carry oxygen, which is crucial for energy production.
    *   Young men's RBC count: ~4.8.
    *   Older adults' RBC count: ~3.9.
*   **Proposed Intervention:** Reduce daily yogurt intake from ~440 grams to 300 grams.
    *   **Expected Outcome for RBCs:** Extrapolating the trend line suggests an RBC count around 5, aiming to maintain RBCs closer to biological youth.
    *   **Potential Impact on Glucose/Creatinine:** A one-third reduction in yogurt intake may also decrease glucose and creatinine levels if saturated fat in yogurt is a contributing factor.
    *   **Goal:** Lower glucose and creatinine while keeping RBC counts high.

### Future Focus
*   Further investigation into CRP, MCV, and RDW will be covered in a future video.
