# 2021-12-11 Is Relying Solely On Data From Published Studies A Suboptimal Strategy For Optimal Health

## Executive Summary

*   Red blood cell (RBC) counts tend to decline with age in both men and women, suggesting that higher RBC levels are associated with youth.
*   A biomarker-by-biomarker correlation analysis revealed that higher red blood cell counts are significantly correlated with more "wrong direction" biomarkers (those associated with aging or increased mortality risk) than "right direction" biomarkers.
*   Specifically, higher RBCs correlate positively with glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), neutrophils, monocytes, AST, and ALT, all of which tend to increase with age and/or are associated with increased mortality risk.
*   Conversely, higher RBCs correlate with lower albumin, lower mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and higher platelets. Albumin and platelets are associated with better health outcomes, while MCV declines with age.
*   Based on this analysis, the optimal red blood cell count may be lower than initially assumed based on aging trends alone, suggesting a need for personalized biomarker optimization beyond published reference ranges.

## Red Blood Cell Trends and Aging

*   **Reference Range (LabCorp):** 4.14 to 5.8 million red blood cells per microliter of blood.
*   **Aging Data:**
    *   **Men (Green Line):** Red blood cell count shows a consistent decline with age.
    *   **Women (Blue Line):** Red blood cell count shows variability, declining in youth, increasing until around age 55, and then consistently declining up to age 95.
*   **Interpretation:** The decline of red blood cells with aging suggests that higher levels are associated with youth.

## Personal Red Blood Cell Data Analysis

*   **2008-2013 (6 measurements, no diet tracking):** Average RBC count of 4.96 million/µL. This was higher than the aging curve for men.
*   **2015-2019 (17 measurements, diet tracking initiated):** Average RBC count of 4.62 million/µL. This was a statistically significant decrease from the earlier period and placed the individual on the aging curve.
*   **Late 2019 - November 2021 (13 measurements, dietary interventions):** Average RBC count of 5.1 million/µL. This was a statistically significant increase from the 2015-2019 period and placed the individual above the aging curve.

## Biomarker Correlations with Red Blood Cells

The following analysis assesses the correlation of red blood cells with 23 systemic "big picture" biomarkers, evaluating if the correlations move in a "right" (beneficial for health/longevity) or "wrong" (detrimental for health/longevity) direction.

*   **Glucose:**
    *   **Trend:** Increases with aging.
    *   **Mortality Risk:** Higher levels are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **RBC Correlation:** Positive correlation (higher RBCs with higher glucose).
    *   **Direction:** Wrong (Red Arrow).

*   **Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN):**
    *   **Trend:** Increases with aging.
    *   **Mortality Risk:** Higher levels are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **RBC Correlation:** Positive correlation (higher RBCs with higher BUN).
    *   **Direction:** Wrong (Red Arrow).

*   **Albumin:**
    *   **Trend:** Declines with aging. Higher levels in youth, lower in advanced age.
    *   **Mortality Risk:** Relatively higher levels are associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **RBC Correlation:** Positive correlation (higher RBCs with higher albumin).
    *   **Direction:** Right (Green Arrow).

*   **Neutrophils:**
    *   **Trend:** Increase with aging.
    *   **Mortality Risk:** Higher levels are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **RBC Correlation:** Positive correlation (higher RBCs with higher neutrophils).
    *   **Direction:** Wrong (Red Arrow).

*   **Monocytes:**
    *   **Trend:** Increase with aging.
    *   **Mortality Risk:** Higher levels are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **RBC Correlation:** Positive correlation (higher RBCs with higher monocytes).
    *   **Direction:** Wrong (Red Arrow).

*   **Percentage of Lymphocytes:**
    *   **Trend:** Declines with aging. Higher in youth, lower in advanced age.
    *   **Mortality Risk:** No established association with all-cause mortality risk in available data.
    *   **RBC Correlation:** Negative correlation (higher RBCs with lower lymphocyte percentage).
    *   **Direction:** Wrong (Red Arrow).

*   **Platelets:**
    *   **Trend:** (Not explicitly stated in relation to aging, but inferred from prior analysis).
    *   **Mortality Risk:** (Not explicitly stated in relation to aging, but inferred from prior analysis).
    *   **RBC Correlation:** Positive correlation (higher RBCs with higher platelets).
    *   **Direction:** Right (Green Arrow).

*   **Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV):**
    *   **Trend:** Declines with aging. Higher in youth, declines with age.
    *   **Mortality Risk:** (Not explicitly stated).
    *   **RBC Correlation:** Negative correlation (higher RBCs with lower MCV).
    *   **Direction:** Right (Green Arrow).

*   **AST and ALT:**
    *   **Trend:** Liver function tends to decline with age, which may correlate with AST/ALT.
    *   **Mortality Risk:** (Not explicitly stated).
    *   **RBC Correlation:** Positive correlation (higher RBCs with higher AST and ALT).
    *   **Direction:** Wrong (Red Arrow for both).

## Summary of Correlation Directions for Red Blood Cells

*   **Right Direction (Green Arrows):** Albumin, Platelets, MCV (3 biomarkers)
*   **Wrong Direction (Red Arrows):** Glucose, BUN, Neutrophils, Monocytes, Lymphocytes (percentage), AST, ALT (7 biomarkers)

## Conclusion and Strategy

*   **Finding:** Seven out of eleven significantly correlated biomarkers are moving in the "wrong direction" when red blood cell counts are higher.
*   **Implication:** This suggests that red blood cell levels towards the higher end of the observed range (e.g., 5.1 million/µL) may not be optimal.
*   **Future Plan:** Modify diet to aim for a reduction in red blood cell count to within the 4.6 to 4.85 million/µL range, which is slightly below the 13-year average.
*   **Methodology:** The biomarker-by-biomarker correlation approach offers greater specificity for identifying optimal individual biomarker levels compared to solely relying on published studies and general reference ranges.
