# 2022-11-13 Longitudinal Biomarker Optimization - A Road To Maximize Health And Longevity

### Executive Summary
*   Third-generation biological clocks, such as DunedinPACE, are derived from longitudinal data, measuring the pace of epigenetic aging in the same individuals over time, offering a potentially more accurate assessment than cross-sectional clocks.
*   Longitudinal optimization of individual blood biomarkers, by tracking changes over time and comparing them to age-related population trends and all-cause mortality risk data, holds promise for improving health and extending lifespan.
*   Fasting glucose levels generally increase with age, with population studies identifying lowest all-cause mortality risk in the 80-94 mg/dL range. The goal is to avoid the age-related increase and consistently maintain levels within this optimal range.
*   Albumin levels typically peak in youth and decline with age, with lowest all-cause mortality risk associated with values in the 45-48 g/L range. Longitudinal goals should focus on resisting the age-related decline and staying within this optimal range.
*   Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) commonly increases with age, and values below 12.5% are linked to the lowest all-cause mortality risk. Optimizing RDW involves preventing age-related increases and consistently maintaining levels below this threshold.

## Biological Clocks

Biological clocks are tools to predict chronological age or all-cause mortality risk.

*   **First and Second Generation Clocks:**
    *   Derived from cross-sectional data.
    *   Examples: Blood biomarker-based PhenoAge and aging.ai; epigenetic tests like Horvath, Hannem, DNAm PhenoAge, and GrimAge.
*   **Third Generation Clocks:**
    *   Derived from longitudinal data (repeated measurements in the same individuals over time).
    *   Current known example: DunedinPACE, an epigenetic test measuring the pace of epigenetic aging, developed from the longitudinal Dunedin study.
    *   Note: There are currently no third-generation biological clocks for blood-based biomarkers.

Optimizing individual biomarkers over time can address the question of whether longitudinal biomarker optimization improves health and extends lifespan. This approach involves evaluating personal biomarker changes or their stability against published values.

This discussion focuses on three specific biomarkers:
*   **Glucose:** Indicator of metabolic health and function.
*   **Albumin:** Indicator of hepatic (liver) health and function.
*   **RDW (Red Blood Cell Distribution Width):** A subdivision of red blood cells, indicating an immune-related marker.

## Glucose

Fasting glucose levels typically increase during aging. Data from a large study of 12.5 million people (age 18-88) shows:
*   Youthful values: Around 85 mg/dL for men and women.
*   Older adults (88 years): Levels increase to over 100 mg/dL.
*   Lowest all-cause mortality risk: Identified in the 80-94 mg/dL range.
*   Quest Diagnostics reference range: 65-99 mg/dL (focusing solely on this range may obscure age-related trends).

### Longitudinal Glucose Goals:
*   Avoid the age-related increase.
*   Consistently stay within the 80-94 mg/dL range.

### Personal Glucose Data (17 years, 45 tests):
*   A positive correlation with age was observed (correlation coefficient: 0.26, p-value: 0.09), showing a trend towards increasing glucose, though not statistically significant over the entire period.
*   Historical average glucose levels increased from the 80s into the 90s.
*   In 2022, an average glucose level of 89 mg/dL over six tests was achieved, partially reversing previous trends.
*   The overall average glucose (89.6 mg/dL) over 17 years is typical for someone around 30 years old, which is approximately 20 years younger than expected for the chronological age during which the blood tests were accrued (where levels closer to 100 mg/dL would be expected).
*   **Achieved Goal 1 (Avoiding age-related increase):** Yes, due to recent improvements.
*   **Achieved Goal 2 (Consistently staying within 80-94 mg/dL):** Yes, 37 out of 45 tests (82%) were within this lowest all-cause mortality risk range.

## Albumin

Albumin levels generally decline during aging. Data from a large study of 1.1 million people (birth to 100 years):
*   Peak levels: In youth, around 45 g/L for women and 46 g/L for men.
*   Decline with age: Centenarians show values approaching 36 g/L.
*   Quest Diagnostics reference range: 36-51 g/L (this broad range would not identify the age-related decline, as both youthful and centenarian levels fall within it).
*   Lowest all-cause mortality risk: Identified in the 45-48 g/L range in a study of several hundred thousand people.

### Longitudinal Albumin Goals:
*   Avoid the age-related decline.
*   Consistently stay within the 45-48 g/L range.

### Personal Albumin Data (18 years, 46 tests):
*   A significant increase in albumin levels over time was observed (correlation coefficient: 0.3, p-value: <0.05). This means personal levels resisted the age-related decrease and instead increased.
*   **Achieved Goal 1 (Avoiding age-related decline):** Yes, a significant increase was observed.
*   **Achieved Goal 2 (Consistently staying within 45-48 g/L):** No, only 18 out of 46 tests (39%) were within this range.
    *   Note: Chart units were in g/dL; 4.5-4.8 g/dL corresponds to 45-48 g/L.
    *   Albumin levels greater than 49 g/L (4.9 g/dL) are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   Recent improvements: The last two tests showed levels of 4.6 and 4.8 g/dL, indicating a better trend towards the optimal range.

## Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW)

RDW percent generally increases during aging. Data from a study of 4,700 people (under 50 to over 100 years):
*   RDW increases with age (correlation coefficient: 0.32, p-value: 1 x 10^-253).
*   Quest Diagnostics reference range: 11-15% (this range would largely miss the age-related increase, as median values for most age groups fall below 15%). Only male centenarians showed a median RDW higher than 15%.
*   Lowest all-cause mortality risk: Identified with an RDW of less than 12.5% in a study of over 3 million people.

### Longitudinal RDW Goals:
*   Avoid the age-related increase.
*   Consistently keep RDW percent less than 12.5%.

### Personal RDW Data (20 years, 43 tests):
*   A non-significant, inverse correlation for RDW versus age was observed, meaning RDW did not significantly increase over time.
*   **Achieved Goal 1 (Avoiding age-related increase):** Yes, RDW did not increase over time.
*   **Achieved Goal 2 (Consistently keeping RDW percent less than 12.5%):** No, only 24 out of 43 tests (56%) were below 12.5%.
    *   Recent improvements: All six tests in 2022 showed RDW less than 12.5%, with an average of 12%, indicating a positive trend.

## Methodological Considerations

This approach utilizes cross-sectional aging and all-cause mortality data to define optimal ranges. While longitudinal studies (repeated measures in the same people) are ideal for tracking individual changes, cross-sectional studies often offer significantly larger sample sizes (e.g., millions of individuals) which can provide robust population-level insights into age-related biomarker trends and their correlation with mortality risk. The data from longitudinal and cross-sectional studies largely agree on general trends.
