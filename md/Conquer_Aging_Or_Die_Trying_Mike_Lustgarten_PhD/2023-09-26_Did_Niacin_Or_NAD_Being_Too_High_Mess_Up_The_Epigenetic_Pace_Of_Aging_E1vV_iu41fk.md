# 2023-09-26 Did Niacin Or NAD Being Too High Mess Up The Epigenetic Pace Of Aging

## Executive Summary

*   The Horvath epigenetic clock shows a strong linear correlation (r=0.94) with chronological age, making it suitable for age prediction.
*   Dunedin Pace is proposed as a better epigenetic clock for measuring the rate of aging.
*   The most recent Dunedin Pace test result was 0.98, indicating one year of epigenetic aging per year of chronological aging, which is higher than the optimal 0.6.
*   Average Dunedin Pace in 2023 (0.83) is not statistically different from 2022 (0.84), despite the recent 0.98 result.
*   Higher average daily niacin intake was significantly correlated with a higher Dunedin Pace, although one data point may be an outlier.
*   Average Horvath epigenetic age has decreased by approximately two years between 2022 and 2023, showing a near-significant trend towards younger epigenetic age.
*   Higher average daily body weight was significantly correlated with an older Horvath epigenetic age.

## Epigenetic Clocks: Horvath vs. Dunedin Pace

### Horvath Clock (DNA Methylation Age)

*   The Horvath clock is considered the best epigenetic clock for predicting chronological age.
*   It demonstrates a strong linear correlation with chronological age, with a correlation coefficient of 0.94.
*   For the July 5th test (test #4 in 2023), the Horvath epigenetic age was 52.49 years, which is 2 years older than the chronological age of 50.4 years.

### Dunedin Pace

*   Dunedin Pace is considered potentially the best epigenetic clock for predicting the epigenetic rate of aging.
*   The optimal Dunedin Pace value is 0.6.

## Personal Epigenetic Aging Data

### Dunedin Pace Results

*   **Most Recent Test (July 5, 2023, Test #4):**
    *   Dunedin Pace: 0.98
    *   Interpretation: 1 year of epigenetic aging per 1 year of chronological aging.
*   **2023 Average (4 tests):** 0.83
*   **2022 Average (3 tests):** 0.84
*   **Statistical Comparison (2023 vs. 2022):** A two-sample t-test showed a p-value of 0.45, indicating no statistically significant difference between the 2023 and 2022 average Dunedin Pace.

### Horvath Epigenetic Age Results

*   **July 5, 2023 (Test #4):** 52.49 years
*   **2023 Average (4 tests):** 52.8 years
*   **2022 Average (3 tests):** 55 years
*   **Statistical Comparison (2023 vs. 2022):** A two-sample t-test showed a p-value of 0.06, indicating a near-significant trend of approximately 2 years reduction in Horvath epigenetic age in 2023 compared to 2022.

## Factors Potentially Influencing Epigenetic Pace

### Niacin Intake and Dunedin Pace

*   **Methodology:** Average daily niacin intake was calculated over 60 days preceding each epigenetic test.
*   **Finding:** A significant positive correlation was observed between average daily niacin intake and Dunedin Pace. Higher niacin intake was correlated with a higher (worse) Dunedin Pace.
*   **Caveat:** One data point appeared to be an outlier, potentially influencing the correlation.

### NAD Levels and Dunedin Pace

*   The speaker supplemented with 654 mg/day of nicotinic acid for 9 days prior to the July 5th test.
*   NAD level on July 5th was 67.4 µmol/L, the highest recorded to date (baseline is 20-25 µmol/L).
*   Further data is needed to determine if NAD levels are correlated with Dunedin Pace and to identify optimal NAD levels.

### Vitamin B6 Intake and Dunedin Pace

*   **Methodology:** Similar to niacin, average daily Vitamin B6 intake was calculated over 60 days preceding each epigenetic test.
*   **Finding:** A significant positive correlation was observed between average daily Vitamin B6 intake and Dunedin Pace. Higher Vitamin B6 intake was correlated with a higher (worse) Dunedin Pace.
*   **Caveat:** Similar to niacin, one data point appeared to be an outlier, potentially influencing the correlation.

### Body Weight and Horvath Epigenetic Age

*   **Methodology:** Average body weight was calculated over the 60 days preceding each epigenetic test.
*   **Finding:** A significant positive correlation was observed between average daily body weight and Horvath epigenetic age. Higher body weight was correlated with an older Horvath epigenetic age, and lower body weight was correlated with a younger Horvath epigenetic age.

## Future Directions

*   Investigate correlations between NAD levels and Dunedin Pace.
*   Determine optimal NAD levels for epigenetic aging.
*   Monitor Horvath's age with further body weight reduction.
