# 2021-03-07 Quantifying Biological Age - Blood Test 1 in 2021

*   Achieved a phenotypic biological age of 32.6 years, 15.4 years younger than chronological age (48 years), marking the lowest biological age recorded in 10 measurements since 2018.
*   Significantly reduced C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation and aging, by 40% since the last test (December 2020), reaching 0.27 mg/L.
*   Data suggests an indirect pathway where higher dietary cholesterol leads to higher blood total cholesterol, and higher total blood cholesterol (specifically high-density lipoprotein, HDL) is correlated with lower CRP.
*   Higher sodium intake and lower fructose intake were individually correlated with higher HDL levels, with these two dietary factors together explaining 40% of HDL variability.
*   Future dietary interventions aim to increase dietary cholesterol (targeting ~250 mg/day) and sodium intake while limiting fructose, with the goal of further optimizing HDL and reducing CRP.

## Biological Age Data

The phenotypic age, a measure of biological age, was 32.6 years. This is 15.4 years younger than the chronological age of 48 years. This represents the lowest biological age recorded over 10 measurements since 2018.

**Comparison with Previous Blood Tests:**
*   **December 2020:** Biological age was 33.8 years, indicating an improvement of 1.2 years in the two-month period.
*   **March 2020:** Biological age was 33.4 years. Despite a one-year increase in chronological age, biological age was reduced by 0.8 years year-over-year.

A major change contributing to this improvement was a 40% reduction in C-reactive protein (CRP), a measure of inflammation.

## Lifestyle Approach

The following outlines the approach to maintaining a youthful biological age:

### Fitness Stats (Average)

*   **Body Weight:** 157.6 pounds (for a 5'7" height), resulting in a BMI of 24.7 kg/m², which is at the upper end of the lean category.
*   **Resting Heart Rate (RHR):** 49 beats per minute.
*   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** 49 milliseconds. This is approximately 10 milliseconds lower than its peak average, potentially attributed to minor weight and fat gain over the past six months.

### Supplement Protocol

*   **Levothyroxine:** Taken daily for hypothyroidism (for approximately 25 years).
*   **Vitamin D:** 1000 IUs daily, exclusively during winter months when sun exposure is limited.
*   **Methylfolate, Methyl B12, and B6:** A stacked supplement taken to manage homocysteine levels, aiming to reduce them from a typical range of ~15 (approximately twice the desired level) to less than 10.

### Dietary Intake Protocol & Averages

The dietary methodology involves:
*   Weighing all food consumed.
*   Entering food data into an online nutrition tracking application.
*   Exporting and analyzing macro and micronutrient data in Excel to identify correlations between diet and blood biomarkers for optimization.

**Average Daily Dietary Intake (2-Month Period):**
*   **Calories:** 2615 kcal
*   **Protein:** 123 grams (19% of total calorie intake)
*   **Fat:** 95 grams (32% of total calorie intake)
*   **Carbohydrates:** 335 grams (51% of total calorie intake)
    *   **Fiber:** 100.5 grams
    *   **Net Carbohydrates:** Approximately 235 grams (36% of total calorie intake after subtracting fiber)
*   **Dietary Cholesterol:** 178 milligrams

## Deeper Look at C-Reactive Protein (CRP)

CRP levels showed a significant reduction in the latest blood test. In 2020, CRP measurements ranged from 0.3 to 1.01 mg/L. The latest measurement is 0.27 mg/L, which is about half of the average 2020 value (0.54 mg/L). Keeping CRP low is important as it increases with aging and higher levels are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.

### Variables Impacting CRP

**1. Blood Cholesterol and CRP:**
Higher blood levels of total cholesterol (TC) were correlated with lower CRP, within a personal range of 133 to 185 mg/dL. This suggests a potential inverse relationship.

**2. Dietary Cholesterol and Blood Cholesterol:**
Higher average dietary cholesterol intake was correlated with higher blood TC levels.

**3. Dietary Cholesterol and CRP:**
Dietary cholesterol was not significantly correlated with CRP directly. This suggests an indirect effect:
Dietary Cholesterol (higher) -> Blood Total Cholesterol (higher) -> (Undetermined Mechanism) -> CRP (lower)

**4. Components of Total Cholesterol (TC) and CRP:**
TC = HDL + LDL + VLDL. Investigating individual components:
*   **VLDL:** Not correlated with CRP.
*   **LDL:** Relatively close to a significant correlation with CRP (p=0.1).
*   **HDL:** Higher HDL was inversely correlated with lower CRP (statistically significant).

Thus, the pathway appears to be:
Dietary Cholesterol (higher) -> Blood Total Cholesterol (higher) -> HDL (higher) -> CRP (lower)

### Factors Impacting HDL

**1. Dietary Cholesterol and HDL:**
Dietary cholesterol was not significantly correlated with HDL.

**2. Sodium and Fructose Intake and HDL:**
*   **Sodium:** Higher average daily sodium intake (within a range of 1400-2600 mg/day) was correlated with higher HDL.
*   **Fructose:** Higher average daily total fructose intake (including fructose from sucrose) was correlated with lower HDL.

A multivariate model including sodium and fructose explained 40% of the variability in HDL levels. This leaves 60% of HDL variability to be explained by other factors, which will be explored in future analyses.

### Sodium, Fructose, and CRP

**1. Sodium and CRP:**
Higher sodium intake (within a range of 1500-2500 mg/day) was correlated with lower CRP (p=0.05).

**2. Fructose and CRP:**
Average daily fructose intake was not correlated with CRP.

Thus, the pathways identified are:
Sodium (higher) -> HDL (higher) -> CRP (lower)
Fructose (higher) -> HDL (lower) -> CRP (higher)

## Future Interventions and Goals

For the next blood test, the following dietary adjustments will be experimented with:
*   **Increase Dietary Cholesterol:** Aim to increase daily intake closer to 250 mg/day (from the current 178 mg/day). Dietary cholesterol intakes up to 250 mg/day are associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Increase Sodium:** Experiment with a slightly higher intake, potentially around 2700 mg/day, while closely monitoring blood pressure, creatinine, and glucose levels to avoid adverse effects.
*   **Limit Fructose:** Target an average daily fructose intake of 70-80 grams or less.

The hypothesis is that these changes will further reduce CRP and increase HDL.
