# 2022-07-03 Lithocholic Acid - A Gut Bacterial Metabolite That Extends Lifespan

## Executive Summary
*   Circulating levels of bile acids are elevated in Little (dwarf) mice, a mouse model of longevity.
*   Cholic acid, a primary bile acid, extends lifespan in a mouse model of accelerated aging.
*   Lithocholic acid extends lifespan in both yeast and fruit flies under caloric restricted and non-caloric restricted conditions.
*   Fecal levels of lithocholic acid are higher in centenarians and their offspring compared to younger age groups.
*   Blood levels of lithocholic acid are significantly increased after both endurance and resistance exercise.

## Mouse Data: Bile Acids and Lifespan

Circulating levels of bile acids are elevated in a mouse model of longevity. This model uses Little (dwarf) mice, which have a mutation in the growth hormone receptor, leading to 99% reduced levels of circulating growth hormone.

### Survival Data in Little (dwarf) Mice

*   **Median Survival:** 50% survival.
*   **Maximum Survival:** 10% survival.

Little (dwarf) mice show a significant increase in both median and maximum lifespan.

### Bile Acid Levels in Little (dwarf) Mice vs. Wild-Type Mice

Seven bile acids were measured in the blood of Little (dwarf) mice and wild-type mice.

*   All bile acids, except alpha-muricholic acid, were significantly higher in Little (dwarf) mice compared to wild-type mice.
*   Increases ranged from 2.8-fold to 5.4-fold.
*   Total levels of these bile acids were 4.2-fold elevated in Little (dwarf) mice.

This data suggests that circulating bile acids are associated with an increased lifespan. While the primary intervention was the mutation in the growth hormone receptor, bile acids are associated with an increased lifespan.

## Causation: Cholic Acid and Lifespan Extension

One of these bile acids, cholic acid (a primary bile acid), was significantly higher in Little (dwarf) mice (3.5-fold higher) compared to wild-type mice. Cholic acid on its own extends lifespan in a mouse model of accelerated aging.

### Study on Accelerated Aging Mice (ZMPSTE24 Knockout Mice)

*   **Model:** ZMPSTE24 knockout mice, which represent a genetic model of accelerated aging (progeria).
*   **Groups:**
    *   Control-fed mice.
    *   Cholic acid-fed mice (0.1% cholic acid in the diet).
*   **Outcomes:**
    *   **Median Lifespan (50% survival):** A significant 7% increase in median lifespan in cholic acid-fed mice.
    *   **Maximum Lifespan (20% survival):** A borderline significant increase in maximum lifespan (P-value = 0.054) in cholic acid-fed mice.

This demonstrates that cholic acid can extend lifespan in an accelerated aging mouse model.

## Lithocholic Acid: Lifespan Extension in Other Models

Lithocholic acid (LCA) was 3.7-fold higher in Little (dwarf) mice compared to wild-type mice. It can extend lifespan in yeast and flies.

### Lithocholic Acid and Lifespan in Yeast

*   **Yeast Strain:** *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.
*   **Measurement:** Percentage of alive yeast cells over days in culture.
*   **Control (Wild-Type Yeast):** Not supplemented with bile acids. Median survival was 12 days.

When yeast were supplemented with lithocholic acid:

*   **Calorie-Restricted Conditions (0.2% glucose):** A dramatic increase in median lifespan up to 30 days, representing a 2.5-fold increase.
*   **Non-Calorie-Restricted Conditions (2% glucose):** Lithocholic acid still increased both average and maximum lifespan.

Therefore, lithocholic acid extends lifespan in yeast under both calorie-restricted and non-caloric restricted conditions.

### Lithocholic Acid and Lifespan in Flies

Lithocholic acid extends lifespan in male *W1118* flies.

*   **Measurement:** Survival percentage over age (days).
*   **Groups:**
    *   Control flies.
    *   Lithocholic acid-supplemented flies.
*   **Outcomes:** Significant increases in both median and maximum lifespan in flies supplemented with lithocholic acid.

## Human Evidence: Lithocholic Acid and Longevity

Fecal levels of lithocholic acid are higher in centenarians (people aged over 100 years) compared to younger age groups.

### Study 1: Centenarians vs. Younger Age Groups

*   **Measurement:** Micro-moles of lithocholic acid per gram of feces.
*   **Groups:**
    *   **Centenarians:** 160 people, average age 107 years.
    *   **Older:** Average age 86 years (112 subjects).
    *   **Young:** Average age 31 years (41 subjects).
    *   **Centenarian Offspring (CEL):** Average age 75 years (22 subjects).
*   **Findings:** Centenarians had significantly higher levels of lithocholic acid compared to all other groups (older, young, and their offspring).

### Study 2: Centenarians vs. Their Offspring

*   **Measurement:** Lithocholic acid levels in feces.
*   **Groups:**
    *   **Centenarians (or close to centenarian):** Average age 97 years (range 94-105 years).
    *   **Offspring:** Average age 67 years (range 50-79 years).
*   **Findings:** Centenarians had a 43% higher level of lithocholic acid in feces compared to their offspring. This difference was statistically significant (P-value and false discovery rate (FDR) were both less than 0.05).

### Gut Bacteria Connection

Relatively higher fecal levels of lithocholic acid suggest a role for gut bacteria in longevity.

*   **Cholesterol to Bile Acids:** Cholesterol in the liver is degraded to primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA).
*   **Conjugation:** CDCA is conjugated with taurine or glycine to form tauro-CDCA or glyco-CDCA.
*   **Intestinal Conversion:** These conjugated metabolites are released by the gallbladder into the intestine after a meal. Gut bacteria then convert them into either ursodeoxycholate (UDCA) or lithocholic acid (LCA).
*   **LCA Production:** Lithocholic acid is exclusively produced by gut bacteria.

## Modulating Lithocholic Acid Levels

### Exercise Increases Lithocholic Acid Levels

Exercise may be one way to increase levels of lithocholic acid. Blood levels of lithocholic acid are increased after both endurance and resistance exercise.

### Endurance Exercise Protocol

*   **Subjects:** 10 young men (average age 24 years), lean (BMI 23.7, body fat 12.7%), and fit (VO2 peak 55.7).
*   **Protocol:**
    1.  10-minute warm-up on the bike.
    2.  50 minutes of biking at 70% of VO2 peak (total 1 hour of endurance exercise).
*   **Results:**
    *   **Before Exercise:** 0.01 micromolar.
    *   **60 minutes Post-Exercise:** Tripled to 0.03 micromolar.
    *   **180 minutes Post-Exercise:** Doubled to 0.02 micromolar.

Lithocholic acid levels were increased up to 3 hours after endurance exercise.

### Resistance Exercise Protocol

*   **Subjects:** Same 10 young, lean, fit men as above.
*   **Protocol:**
    1.  5-minute warm-up on the bike.
    2.  15 reps each for squats, push-ups, sit-ups, and back raises.
    3.  5 sets of 10 reps each for knee extension, bench press, hamstring curls, lat pull-downs, and leg press.
*   **Results:**
    *   **Before Exercise:** 0.01 micromolar.
    *   **60 minutes Post-Exercise:** Tripled.
    *   **180 minutes Post-Exercise:** Tripled.

Blood lithocholic acid levels were tripled up to 3 hours after resistance exercise.
