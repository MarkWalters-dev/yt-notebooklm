# 2022-07-03 Lithocholic Acid - A Gut Bacterial Metabolite That Extends Lifespan

### Executive Summary

*   Circulating levels of multiple bile acids are significantly elevated (2.8 to 5.4-fold) in Little (dwarf) mice, a mouse model of extended longevity.
*   Cholic acid, a primary bile acid, extended median lifespan by 7% in a mouse model of accelerated aging (ZMPSTE24 knockout mice).
*   Lithocholic acid (LCA) dramatically extends lifespan in yeast (2.5-fold increase) under both calorie-restricted and non-calorie-restricted conditions, and also significantly extends median and maximum lifespan in male fruit flies.
*   Fecal lithocholic acid levels are significantly higher (e.g., 43% higher in one study) in human centenarians compared to younger age groups and their offspring, highlighting its gut bacterial origin and potential link to human longevity.
*   Both one hour of endurance exercise and one hour of resistance exercise acutely increased blood lithocholic acid levels up to three-fold in young, fit men, with levels remaining elevated for at least three hours.

## Bile Acids and Longevity in Mice

Circulating levels of bile acids are elevated in a mouse model of longevity. Little (dwarf) mice, which have a mutation in the growth hormone receptor leading to 99% reduced levels of circulating growth hormone, exhibit significantly increased median and maximal lifespan compared to control animals. Median survival is when 50% of the colony has died, and maximum survival is when 90% of the colony has died.

Data on seven specific bile acids in the blood of Little (dwarf) mice compared to wild-type mice show that all but one, alpha-muricholic acid, are significantly higher in the Little (dwarf) mice. These increases range from 2.8-fold to 5.4-fold higher. Total levels of these bile acids are 4.2-fold elevated in the Little (dwarf) mice. This suggests that circulating bile acids are associated with an increased lifespan.

### Cholic Acid Extends Lifespan in Accelerated Aging Mice

One of these elevated bile acids, cholic acid, a primary bile acid, was 3.5-fold higher in the Little (dwarf) mice compared to wild-type. Cholic acid on its own has been shown to extend lifespan in a mouse model of accelerated aging (ZMPSTE24 knockout mice, a progeria model).

In this study:
*   ZMPSTE24 knockout mice were divided into control-fed and cholic acid-fed groups (0.1% cholic acid in the diet).
*   Median lifespan (50% survival) increased by 7% in the cholic acid-fed group.
*   Maximum lifespan (20% survival) showed a borderline significant increase (p = 0.054).

## Lithocholic Acid Extends Lifespan in Yeast

Lithocholic acid (LCA), which was 3.7-fold higher in Little (dwarf) mice, extends lifespan in yeast.
Yeast cells supplemented with lithocholic acid showed a dramatic increase in median lifespan, from 12 days (wild type, non-supplemented) to 30 days, representing a 2.5-fold increase. This effect was observed when yeast cells were grown under 0.2% glucose conditions, which are calorie-restricted.

### LCA Extends Yeast Lifespan Under Calorie-Restricted and Non-Calorie-Restricted Conditions

Further research confirmed that lithocholic acid extends lifespan in yeast under both calorie-restricted (0.2% glucose) and non-calorie-restricted (2% glucose) conditions. Significant increases were observed for both average and maximum lifespan across different glucose concentrations when lithocholic acid was supplemented.

## Lithocholic Acid Extends Lifespan in Flies

Lithocholic acid also extends lifespan in male *W 1118* flies. Supplementation with lithocholic acid resulted in significant increases in both median (50% survival) and maximum lifespan (10% survival) in these flies.

## Human Evidence for Lithocholic Acid and Longevity

Fecal levels of lithocholic acid are higher in centenarians (people over 100 years old) when compared with younger age groups.

In one study:
*   Centenarians (average age 107 years, n=160) had significantly higher fecal LCA levels than:
    *   Older adults (average age 86 years, n=112)
    *   Younger adults (average age 31 years, n=41)
    *   Centenarian lineal descendants (average age 75 years, n=22)

### Significance of Fecal Lithocholic Acid Levels

Relatively higher fecal levels of lithocholic acid suggest a role for gut bacteria in longevity. Lithocholic acid is exclusively produced by gut bacteria. The process begins with cholesterol in the liver, which is degraded to the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). CDCA is then conjugated (e.g., with taurine or glycine) and released into the intestine. In the intestine, gut bacteria convert these conjugated metabolites into secondary bile acids like urso-deoxycholate (UDCA) or lithocholic acid (LCA).

### Replicated Findings in Another Human Study

Another study corroborated these findings, observing that centenarians (average age 97 years, range 94-105 years) had 43% higher levels of fecal lithocholic acid compared to their offspring (average age 67 years, range 50-79 years). This difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05, FDR < 0.05).

## Increasing Lithocholic Acid Levels Through Exercise

Exercise may be a way to increase lithocholic acid levels, as blood levels of lithocholic acid are increased after both endurance and resistance exercise.

A small study (10 young, lean, fit men, average age 24 years, BMI 23.7, body fat 12.7%, VO2 peak 55.7) investigated the acute effects of exercise on blood lithocholic acid levels.

### Endurance Training Protocol

*   10-minute warm-up on a bike.
*   50 minutes of biking at 70% of VO2 peak (a relatively strenuous ride).
*   Total 1 hour of endurance exercise.

**Effect on Blood LCA Levels:**
*   Before exercise: 0.01 micromolar.
*   60 minutes after exercise: Tripled to 0.03 micromolar.
*   3 hours after exercise: Remained elevated at 0.02 micromolar (doubled compared to before exercise).

### Resistance Training Protocol

*   5-minute warm-up on a bike.
*   15 repetitions each for squats, push-ups, sit-ups, and back raises.
*   Five sets of 10 repetitions each for knee extension, bench press, hamstring curls, lat pull-downs, and leg press.

**Effect on Blood LCA Levels:**
*   Before exercise: 0.01 micromolar.
*   60 minutes after exercise: Tripled to 0.03 micromolar.
*   3 hours after exercise: Remained tripled at 0.03 micromolar.

These findings indicate that both endurance and resistance exercise acutely increase blood lithocholic acid levels, with effects lasting for at least three hours post-exercise.
