# 2022-07-03 Lithocholic Acid - A Gut Bacterial Metabolite That Extends Lifespan

## Executive Summary

*   Circulating levels of bile acids are significantly elevated in Little (dwarf) mice, a well-established mouse model of longevity.
*   Cholic acid, a primary bile acid, extends lifespan by 7% in a mouse model of accelerated aging.
*   Lithocholic acid (LCA) dramatically extends lifespan in yeast (under both calorie-restricted and non-calorie-restricted conditions) and significantly in male fruit flies.
*   Fecal lithocholic acid (LCA) levels are consistently and significantly higher in human centenarians compared to younger age groups, suggesting a strong association with exceptional longevity.
*   LCA is exclusively produced by gut bacteria, highlighting the crucial role of the microbiome in its potential anti-aging effects.
*   Both endurance and resistance exercise acutely increase blood levels of lithocholic acid by 2-3 times in young, fit men.

## Mouse Data: Bile Acids and Lifespan

A mouse model of longevity, the Little (dwarf) mouse, exhibits elevated circulating bile acid levels. These mice have a mutation in the growth hormone receptor, leading to a 99% reduction in circulating growth hormone. This genetic modification results in a significant increase in both median and maximal lifespan.

Analysis of seven bile acids in the blood of Little (dwarf) mice compared to wild-type mice revealed that six of the seven bile acids (all except alpha-muricholic acid) were significantly higher in the Little (dwarf) mice. These increases ranged from 2.8-fold to 5.4-fold. Total circulating bile acid levels were 4.2-fold higher in Little (dwarf) mice. This data suggests that elevated circulating bile acids are strongly associated with increased lifespan.

## Cholic Acid: A Causative Link to Lifespan Extension

One specific primary bile acid, cholic acid, was found to be 3.5-fold higher in Little (dwarf) mice. Further research demonstrates that cholic acid on its own can extend lifespan in the ZMPSTE24 knockout mouse model, which exhibits accelerated aging (progeria).

**Study Protocol for Cholic Acid and Lifespan:**

*   ZMPSTE24 knockout mice were divided into control-fed and cholic acid-fed groups.
*   0.1% cholic acid was supplied in the diet.

**Results:**
The cholic acid-fed group showed a significant 7% increase in median lifespan and a borderline significant increase in maximal lifespan (P-value = 0.054).

## Lithocholic Acid (LCA) and Lifespan in Model Organisms

Lithocholic acid (LCA), which was 3.7-fold higher in Little (dwarf) mice, has also been investigated for its effects on longevity in other animal models.

### LCA in Yeast

LCA dramatically extends lifespan in yeast cells.
*   Wild-type yeast (no bile acid supplementation) had a median survival of 12 days.
*   Yeast supplemented with lithocholic acid showed a median lifespan of 30 days, representing a 2.5-fold increase. This effect was initially observed under calorie-restricted conditions (0.2% glucose).

Further studies confirmed that LCA extends lifespan in yeast under both:
*   **Calorie-restricted conditions** (0.2% glucose) for both average and maximum lifespan.
*   **Non-calorie-restricted conditions** (2% glucose, 10-fold higher glucose level) for both average and maximum lifespan.

### LCA in Flies

LCA extends lifespan in male W 1118 flies. Significant increases were observed in both median and maximum lifespan in flies supplemented with LCA. Data for female flies was not presented.

### LCA in Mice

Currently, there is no published data on lithocholic acid supplementation extending lifespan in mice.

## Human Evidence: LCA Levels in Centenarians

Fecal levels of lithocholic acid are consistently higher in centenarians (individuals over 100 years old) compared to younger age groups, suggesting a role for LCA in human longevity.

**Study 1:**
*   **Centenarians** (average age 107 years, n=160) had significantly higher fecal LCA levels compared to:
    *   **Older group** (average age 86 years, n=112)
    *   **Young group** (average age 31 years, n=41)
    *   **Centenarian Offspring (CEL)** (average age 75 years, n=22)

**Study 2 (Replication):**
Another study replicated these findings, showing that centenarians or near-centenarians (ages 94-105 years, average 97 years) had 43% higher fecal LCA levels compared to their offspring (ages 50-79 years, average 67 years). This difference was statistically significant (P-value and False Discovery Rate < 0.05).

## The Gut Microbiome's Role in LCA Production

The relatively higher fecal levels of lithocholic acid in centenarians underscore the importance of gut bacteria in longevity, as LCA is exclusively produced by the gut microbiome.

**Metabolic Pathway of Lithocholic Acid Production:**

Cholesterol (in liver)
-> Enzymatic degradation
-> Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, a primary bile acid)
-> Conjugation with taurine or glycine
-> Tauro-CDCA or Glyco-CDCA (conjugated metabolites)
-> Release from gallbladder into intestine after a meal
-> Gut Bacteria convert conjugated metabolites
-> Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)
OR
-> **Lithocholic acid (LCA)**

## Increasing LCA Levels Through Exercise

Exercise appears to be a method to increase circulating levels of lithocholic acid.

**Study Details:**
A small study involving 10 young, lean, fit men (average age 24, BMI 23.7, body fat 12.7%, VO2 peak 55.7) investigated the acute effects of exercise on blood LCA levels.

### Endurance Training Protocol:

*   10-minute warm-up on a bike
*   50 minutes of biking at 70% of VO2 peak (strenuous ride)
*   Total: 1 hour of endurance exercise

**Results of Endurance Exercise on Blood LCA Levels:**
*   **Before exercise:** 0.01 micromolar
*   **60 minutes after exercise:** 0.03 micromolar (tripled)
*   **3 hours after exercise:** 0.02 micromolar (doubled compared to baseline)

### Resistance Training Protocol:

*   5-minute warm-up on a bike
*   15 repetitions each for: Squats, Push-ups, Sit-ups, Back raises
*   5 sets of 10 repetitions each for: Knee extension, Bench press, Hamstring curls, Lat pull-downs, Leg press

**Results of Resistance Exercise on Blood LCA Levels:**
*   **Before exercise:** 0.01 micromolar
*   **60 minutes after exercise:** Tripled
*   **180 minutes (3 hours) after exercise:** Tripled

These findings indicate that both endurance and resistance exercise acutely increase blood lithocholic acid levels. The question of whether blood LCA levels are chronically higher in athletes compared to sedentary individuals remains unstudied.
