# 2023-05-14 Vitamin B6 - Did It Increase NAD Test Results

### Executive Summary

*   Baseline intracellular NAD levels were approximately 25 micromolar, even with daily vitamin B6 and niacin intake exceeding twice the Recommended Daily Allowance.
*   Daily supplementation with 300 mg of Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) did not increase NAD levels, but 1000 mg of NMN elevated NAD to 39.3 micromolar.
*   Increasing daily vitamin B6 intake from ~3.2 mg to ~11.3-15.6 mg (while off NMN) resulted in a modest increase in NAD levels from a baseline of ~25 micromolar to 30.1 micromolar.
*   This suggests a small, positive impact of vitamin B6 supplementation on intracellular NAD levels.
*   Further investigation with higher vitamin B6 doses (e.g., >30 mg/day) is planned to confirm and quantify this effect.

## Introduction

Vitamin B6 (pyridoxal five phosphate or PLP) plays a crucial role in metabolism. Tryptophan is converted into Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) through the de novo NAD synthesis pathway:

Tryptophan -> NAD

An age-related decline in vitamin B6 levels may limit the conversion of tryptophan into NAD. This experiment investigated whether increasing vitamin B6 intake would lead to a corresponding increase in intracellular NAD levels.

## Study Methodology: Personal NAD Testing Protocol

Blood samples were sent to GINFINITY for NAD level quantification. Dietary intake of B6 and niacin was tracked daily by weighing all food.

*   **Test #1 (January 23):**
    *   **NAD Level:** 25.6 micromolar
    *   **Supplementation:** No NR or NMN taken.
    *   **Average B6 Intake (30 days prior):** 3.2 mg/day ( >2x RDA)
    *   **Average Niacin Intake (30 days prior):** 42 mg/day ( >2x RDA)
    *   *Observation:* Despite high B6 and niacin intake, NAD levels were relatively low.

*   **Test #2 (Date not specified, but followed Test #1):**
    *   **NAD Level:** Approximately 25 micromolar (no significant change from Test #1)
    *   **Supplementation:** Averaged 300 mg NMN per day for 21 days prior.
    *   **Average B6 Intake (21 days prior):** 3.2 mg/day
    *   **Average Niacin Intake (21 days prior):** 41.7 mg/day
    *   *Observation:* 300 mg/day NMN did not impact NAD levels, suggesting a baseline around 25 micromolar.

*   **Test #3 (March 6):**
    *   **NAD Level:** 39.3 micromolar
    *   **Supplementation:** Averaged 1000 mg (1 gram) NMN per day for 7 days prior.
    *   **Average B6 Intake:** Similar to previous tests (not explicitly stated, but inferred as unchanged).
    *   **Average Niacin Intake:** 41.5 mg/day
    *   *Observation:* A high dose of NMN (1000 mg/day) significantly increased NAD levels. This effect is likely specific to NMN, as B6 and niacin intake remained consistent.

*   **Test #4 (April 24 - B6 Experiment):**
    *   **NAD Level:** 30.1 micromolar
    *   **Supplementation:** NMN supplementation was removed for this test to isolate the effect of B6.
    *   **Average B6 Intake (49 days from Test #3 to day before Test #4):** Increased from ~3.2 mg/day to 11.3 mg/day (3-4 fold higher).
    *   **Average B6 Intake (14 days before Test #4):** Increased further to 15.6 mg/day (approximately 5-fold higher than baseline).
    *   **Average Niacin Intake:** Remained consistent with previous tests.
    *   *Observation:* NAD levels were 30.1 micromolar. GINFINITY's ranges classify this as suboptimal.

## Impact of Vitamin B6 on NAD Levels

Comparing Test #4 (30.1 micromolar NAD) to the established baseline without NMN/NR (approximately 25 micromolar NAD from Test #1 and #2), a small increase in intracellular NAD was observed with the increased vitamin B6 supplementation.

This suggests that increasing vitamin B6 intake from roughly 3.2 mg/day to 11.3-15.6 mg/day, while not taking NMN, resulted in a modest elevation of NAD levels by about 5 micromolar.

## Future Directions

To further investigate this potential effect, a higher dose of vitamin B6 (exceeding 30 mg/day, which would be double the current intake and 10 times higher than the intake for Test #3) is planned for Test #5. This aims to determine if a greater increase in vitamin B6 intake can lead to a more substantial rise in NAD levels.
