# 2024-03-20 19.5y Younger Biological Age - Supplements Diet Test 2 in 2024

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age remained 19.5 years younger than chronological age, as calculated by Dr. Morgan Levine's PhenoAge.
*   Garlic intake was increased to 2.6g/day, a 2-fold increase, based on its significant inverse correlation with Horvath epigenetic age (r = -0.59, p < 0.05).
*   Total methylated amino acid intake was elevated by 25% (311 mg/day vs. 246 mg/day) through dietary adjustments (beets, quinoa, oranges, alfalfa, chickpeas, peanuts), but homocysteine paradoxically rose to 11 µmol/L (from an average of 10.4 µmol/L).
*   The lowest average daily calorie intake since 2015 was achieved at 2076 kcal/day, alongside the lowest total fructose intake since 2015 at 61 g/day.
*   Saturated fat intake was experimentally increased to 25g/day for three weeks (primarily from coconut butter) to investigate its hypothesized correlation with higher LDL and a younger Dunedin epigenetic pace of aging.

## Supplements

*   **Levothyroxine:** 137.5 micrograms/day (prescribed for hypothyroidism since mid-twenties).
*   **Vitamin D:** 1000 IU/day for 49 days (due to living in a Northeast Latitude).
*   **Methyl B12:** 1000 micrograms/day for 30 of 49 days (experimenting with its impact on homocysteine).
*   **Nicotinic Acid:** 50-60 mg/day for 18 of 49 days (experimenting with alternative NAD-increasing foods like fenugreek seeds and chickpeas).
*   No other purported geoprotectors or senolytics were used.

## Dietary Methodology

*   **Period:** The dietary data represents a 49-day average from January 15, immediately following Test 1, until March 3, the day before Test 2 in 2024.
*   **Tracking Protocol:**
    *   All food consumed is weighed.
    *   Data is logged into Cronometer.
    *   Data is manually recorded into a spreadsheet.
    *   The average daily dietary intake for the 49-day period is calculated.
    *   Dietary data is aligned with blood test results.
    *   Correlations between dietary intake and biomarkers are analyzed across almost 50 blood tests dating back to 2015, with the goal of optimizing biomarkers.
*   **Food Variety:** 56 different foods were consumed during the 49-day period.
*   **Green Tea:** Organic loose leaf green tea sourced from Japan was consumed.

## Dietary Experiments and Changes

### Garlic Intake

*   **Average Intake:** 2.6 grams/day, which is approximately 2 times higher than the average for the period corresponding to Test 1 (1.4 g/day).
*   **Historical Context:** Both of these recent intakes are higher than the average since 2015 (0.5 g/day).
*   **Rationale:** Garlic intake shows a significant inverse correlation with Horvath epigenetic age over 12 tests (correlation coefficient r = -0.59, p < 0.05).
*   **Hypothesis:** The increased intake was implemented to test if it could further reduce Horvath epigenetic age.

### NAD Precursors (Trigonelline)

*   **Alfalfa Sprouts:** Added to the diet.
    *   **Source:** A good source of Trigonelline (181 micrograms/gram), which increases NAD in mice.
    *   **Average Intake:** 25 grams/day for the 49-day period.
    *   **Intensive Intake:** For 8 days prior to the March 4 test, intake averaged 132 grams/day.
    *   **Cost Efficiency:** Began growing own sprouts to reduce cost ($5 per 100g from grocery store), yielding approximately 700 grams every four days.
    *   **Trigonelline Yield:** The intensive alfalfa sprout intake yielded 24 milligrams of Trigonelline per day.
*   **Other Trigonelline Sources:** Green peas, snow pea shoots, and fenugreek seeds (included for about 10-11 days) were also added.
*   **Total Trigonelline Intake:** These foods provided 48 milligrams of Trigonelline per day. For comparison, the average daily Trigonelline content for Test 1 was 27 milligrams/day.
*   **Context:** 60 milligrams of nicotinic acid previously raised NAD to 39 micromolar, which is higher than the typical baseline of less than 26 micromolar.
*   **Calorie Management:** To accommodate the new foods while staying slightly below the normal calorie intake, barley and oats were reduced from approximately 30 grams/day to 5 grams/day each.

### Methyl Donors and Homocysteine

*   **Goal:** Increase dietary methyl donors to reduce homocysteine levels.
*   **Trimethylglycine (TMG) Sources:**
    *   **Beets:** The most concentrated TMG source in the diet (750 micrograms/gram).
        *   Average intake: 257 grams/day (up from 232 g/day for Test 1).
        *   Intensive intake: For 11 days before the test, beets were increased to 302 grams/day, a 70 g/day increase yielding an additional 53 mg of TMG/day.
    *   **Quinoa:** A good source of TMG (611 micrograms/gram), included at an average of 2.3 g/day. Intake was limited after realizing its rich oxalate content, as oxalate reduction is a goal.
*   **Proline Betaine Sources:** (contains methyl groups attached to a nitrogen atom)
    *   **Oranges:** Added in the previous dietary period (Test 1), replacing some strawberry intake.
    *   **Alfalfa Sprouts:** Contain 70 micrograms/gram, contributing to the methyl donor pool, especially during high intake periods.
*   **Tryptophan Betaine Sources:** (amino acid tryptophan with methyl groups attached to its nitrogen atom)
    *   **Chickpeas:** Already part of the diet, significantly correlated with lower creatinine.
    *   **Peanuts:** Intake increased by 14 grams/day, as they are inversely correlated with the sum of liver enzymes ALT and AST.
    *   **Lentils:** Added, but subsequently removed due to taste preference, despite being the most concentrated source of tryptophan betaine among these foods.
*   **Total Methylated Amino Acid Pool:**
    *   **Test 2:** 311 milligrams/day.
    *   **Test 1:** 246 milligrams/day.
    *   This represents a 25% increase in the potential methyl donor pool.
*   **Homocysteine Outcome:** Homocysteine was 11 micromolar for this test, an increase from the average of 10.4 micromolar over the previous 15 tests, indicating no reduction despite increased methyl donor intake.

### Other Food Changes

*   **Cocoa Beans (Cacao Beans):** Intake was doubled from 1.5 to 3 grams/day. These are significantly correlated with lower MCV, which moved towards more youthful values for this test.
*   **Vanilla Beans:** Intake was increased from once a week to once every three days.
    *   **Rationale:** Vanilla beans are a rich source of vanillin, which inhibits growth and can kill *Serratia marcescens*, a dominant microbe in the oral microbiome. Ingested vanillin may be secreted by salivary glands to reduce *Serratia* levels.
*   **Sunflower Seeds:** Added to the diet.
    *   **Rationale:** Sunflower seeds are a rich source of Vitamin E, similar to almonds, but contain relatively lower oxalates. The aim is to limit oxalate intake while maintaining high calcium for optimizing bone density during aging.
*   **"Cheat Meals":** Limited to no more than two during the 49-day period. These included a homemade version of peanut butter cups (melted chocolate, peanut butter, sweetened with honey).
    *   **Calorie Contribution:** Chocolate chips and honey contributed 0.9% of total calories, meaning the diet was 99.1% clean.

### Caloric Contribution of Foods

*   Sardines consistently contributed the most to daily calorie intake.
*   Nine of the top 10 calorie-contributing foods remained the same as for Test 1. Peanuts entered the list, replacing pistachios, due to increased peanut intake.

## Macronutrient Profile

*   **Calorie Intake:** Averaged 2076 kcal/day, which is the lowest average daily calorie intake since tracking began in 2015 (previous low was 2092 kcal/day).
*   **Protein:** 97 grams/day (approximately 19% of total calories).
*   **Fat:** 84 grams/day (approximately 36% of total calories).
    *   **Saturated Fat:** 19.6 grams/day (similar to Test 1's 19 g/day).
    *   **Saturated Fat Experiment:** For the three weeks prior to this test, average saturated fat intake (almost exclusively from coconut butter) was raised to 25 grams/day. This was done to test the hypothesis that in personal data, saturated fat is significantly correlated with higher LDL, which may be associated with a younger Dunedin epigenetic pace of aging.
    *   **Omega-3 and Omega-6:** Maintained at levels consistent with many previous tests, reflecting a stable core dietary structure.
*   **Carbohydrates:**
    *   **Total Carbs:** 274 grams/day.
    *   **Fiber:** 88 grams/day.
    *   **Net Carbs:** 187 grams/day (Total Carbs - Fiber), constituting 36% of total calories.
    *   **Fiber Metabolism:** An estimated 25% of soluble fiber (approximately 185 calories) is fermented by gut bacteria into short-chain fatty acids, which are then converted into fat. This contributes about 9% of total calories to the fat macro.
        *   **Soluble Fiber Fermentation Process:**
            `Soluble Fiber (~185 calories) -> Gut Bacteria Fermentation -> Short Chain Fatty Acids -> Converted to Fat`
*   **Adjusted Net Macronutrient Ratios (after fiber conversion):**
    *   Fat: ~45%
    *   Net Carbs: ~36%
    *   Protein: ~19%
*   **Sugar Intake:**
    *   **Total Fructose:** Approximately 61 grams/day (calculated as fructose plus half of sucrose).
    *   This is close to the lowest fructose intake since 2015 (57.5 g/day), a significant reduction from previous intakes which were almost double this amount.

## Micronutrient Profile

*   **Vitamins:** Full RDA coverage for all vitamins. Many intakes were considerably higher than the RDA, driven by positive correlations with biomarkers.
    *   **Example (Vitamin K):** Higher intake was maintained due to its positive correlation with a greater number of biomarkers trending in a desirable direction related to aging and all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Example (Beta Carotene):** Intake was maintained below historical highs due to its net negative correlative score with biomarkers.
*   **Minerals:** Full RDA coverage.
