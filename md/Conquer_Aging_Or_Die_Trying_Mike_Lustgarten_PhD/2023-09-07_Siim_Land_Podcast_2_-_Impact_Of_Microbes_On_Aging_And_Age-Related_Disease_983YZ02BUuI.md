# 2023-09-07 Siim Land Podcast 2 - Impact Of Microbes On Aging And Age-Related Disease

## Executive Summary

*   **Microbial Burden and Aging:** Aging is associated with an accumulation of microbes and microbial products in inappropriate locations, contributing to increased immune activation and systemic inflammation.
*   **Gut Barrier Dysfunction:** A compromised gut barrier allows microbial components to leak into the bloodstream, triggering chronic immune responses detrimental to health.
*   **Oral Microbiome and Alzheimer's:** Increased prevalence of bacteria, fungi, and viruses from the oral microbiome has been observed in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.
*   **Soluble Fiber and Gut Acidity:** Soluble fiber is converted into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by gut bacteria, which acidify the colon and limit the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria like *E. coli*.
*   **Holistic Health Approach:** Optimizing health requires considering the interconnectedness of the microbiome, diet, exercise, and systemic biomarkers rather than focusing on isolated interventions.

## Microbial Burden of Aging

The "microbial burden of aging" refers to the accumulation of microbes and/or microbial products in places they shouldn't be, which increases during the aging process. This accumulation can trigger immune activation, which, when chronic, is detrimental to systemic health.

## Gut Barrier Dysfunction and Aging

*   **Worsened Gut Barrier Function:** Aging leads to a compromised gut barrier, allowing substances from the colonic lumen to leak into the bloodstream.
*   **Immune Activation:** Leaked microbial DNA, microbes, or their metabolites into the blood can trigger systemic immune activation.
*   **Colonic Acidity and Pathogens:**
    *   The colon should be acidic to limit the growth of "bad" bacteria like *Enterobacteria* (*E. coli*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*).
    *   With age, the colon becomes more basic, allowing these potentially pathogenic bacteria to proliferate.
    *   *E. coli* levels increase in the aging colon and are found to be 10-15 fold higher in the bloodstream of older individuals compared to younger ones.

### Strategies to Improve Gut Barrier Function

*   **Soluble Fiber Intake:**
    *   High soluble fiber diets are converted by gut bacteria into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).
    *   SCFAs, being acidic, help to acidify the colon.
    *   In vitro studies show high SCFA levels reduce *Enterobacteria*.
    *   SCFAs improve gut barrier function, preventing translocation of microbes into the blood.
    *   Abundant in non-starchy vegetables.
*   **Exercise Training:**
    *   RCTs show exercise training can increase SCFAs in the gut.
    *   Athletes often have higher SCFA levels.
    *   Potential positive association between butyrate and VO2 max.
    *   **Caution:** Excessive exercise (e.g., ultra-endurance) can lead to increased gut barrier leak and elevated LPS in the blood. An optimal training zone is key.
*   **Other Factors:**
    *   **Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (IAP):** This protein improves gut barrier function. Overexpression in mice extends lifespan, and feeding it to diabetic patients improved glycemic status.
        *   **IAP Upregulators:** Vitamin K1 (found in green leafy vegetables) and Vitamin D can increase IAP expression.
    *   **Dietary Factors:**
        *   **Western Diet:** High fat, high sugar, low fiber promotes bacterial dysbiosis, decreases SCFA-producing bacteria, increases *Enterobacteria*, and negatively impacts muscle health.
        *   **Antimicrobial Peptides:** Fat cells produce antimicrobial peptides, potentially acting as a compensation for weakened immune function and impaired gut barrier in aging individuals.

## Microbiome and Age-Related Disease

### Oral Microbiome and Alzheimer's Disease

*   **Increased Microbial Prevalence:** Alzheimer's patients show an increased prevalence of bacteria, fungi, and viruses in their brains compared to age-matched controls.
*   ***P. gingivalis*:** This bacterium from the oral microbiome is implicated and has been found in Alzheimer's patients' brains.
*   **Oral Microbiome Optimization:**
    *   **Nitrates:** Found in vegetable-containing foods (e.g., beets, greens), nitrates can act as prebiotics, favoring beneficial bacteria and reducing levels of *P. gingivalis* and other implicated microbes.
    *   **Antiseptic Mouthwashes:** Avoid antiseptic mouthwashes, as they can kill beneficial oral microbes and may be linked to negative health outcomes like increased blood pressure.

### General Microbial Translocation and Disease

*   **Plaque Formation:** Microbes have been found in arterial plaques, suggesting a potential role in cardiovascular disease.
*   **Metabolic Syndrome and Heart Disease:** These conditions may be accelerated by or contribute to microbial translocation and subsequent immune activation.

## Measuring Gut Barrier Integrity

Reliable direct measures of intestinal barrier function are limited:

*   **Zonulin:** While commonly measured, its accuracy as a marker of gut barrier function is debated; it may instead reflect immune activation.
*   **Breath Tests (Lactulose, Sucralose):** Primarily used to assess small intestine function.
*   **Lipopolysaccharide (LPS):**
    *   Found on the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria.
    *   Elevated LPS in blood is a sign of gut leak.
    *   **Limitations:** Assays are variable, and LPS can bind to lipoproteins (LDL, HDL), affecting circulating levels.
*   **Lipopolysaccharide Binding Protein (LBP):** Elevated LBP in blood can indicate high LPS levels from various sources (mouth, skin, gut).
*   **Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP):**
    *   In the blood, ALP can dephosphorylate and inactivate LPS.
    *   Levels above approximately 48 U/L are associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk. Higher levels may indirectly suggest higher LPS burden.

## Symptoms of Microbial Burden

Symptoms can be non-specific and include malaise and fatigue, making it difficult to differentiate from general infections.

## The Blood Microbiome

*   **Challenges:** Measuring the blood microbiome is difficult due to potential contamination.
*   **Current Status:** Still a debated topic; some studies show transient microbial presence (e.g., after dental procedures), while others associate blood microbes with diseases like cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
*   **Whole Genome Sequencing:** Considered the gold standard but not yet widely commercially available for comprehensive blood microbiome analysis.

## Systemic Biomarkers of Immune Activation

Indirect indicators of microbial burden and immune activation include:

*   **Total White Blood Cells**
*   **Neutrophil and Lymphocyte Counts**
*   **Monocyte Counts**
*   **High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP)**

## Intracellular Infections and Aging

A burgeoning area of research suggests that intracellular infections might play a role in the body selectively killing its own cells and contributing to autoimmunity and aging. Detecting these infections systemically is a significant challenge.

## The Role of Diet and Lifestyle

*   **Western Diet:** High fat, high sugar, and low fiber diets are detrimental, leading to dysbiosis, decreased SCFAs, and increased *Enterobacteria*.
*   **Fiber:** Essential for producing SCFAs, which maintain colonic acidity and gut barrier integrity.
*   **Exercise:** Crucial for SCFA production and overall health.
*   **Vitamins:** Vitamin K1 and D may support gut barrier function.
*   **Skin Microbiome:**
    *   Skin pH is critical for barrier function. An ideal skin pH is around 5.
    *   Aging can lead to increased skin pH.
    *   Harsh soaps and cleansers with high pH (alkaline) can strip the skin's natural barrier and disrupt the skin microbiome.
    *   Products with pH closer to physiological levels are preferable.
    *   Urea creams may have antimicrobial and keratinolytic effects.
*   **Oral Hygiene:**
    *   **Brushing:** Mechanical cleaning is essential.
    *   **Fluoride:** Helps with tooth mineralization; concerns exist if swallowed, but minimal absorption during typical brushing is generally considered safe.
    *   **Mouthwash:**
        *   Mouth pH should be near physiological levels (7.3-7.4); acidic mouthwashes can accelerate cavities.
        *   Sodium bicarbonate solutions can help alkalinize the mouth.
        *   Peppermint oil and xylitol have shown some antimicrobial effects in vitro.
        *   Avoid antiseptic mouthwashes that indiscriminately kill microbes.
*   **Coffee and Tea:**
    *   **Green Tea:** Has been used as a mouthwash with potential benefits for the oral microbiome, though it can cause tooth staining.
    *   **Coffee:** Epidemiological studies associate coffee consumption with reduced all-cause mortality, suggesting a potential net positive systemic effect despite possible isolated negative impacts on the oral microbiome.

## Probiotics and Fermented Foods

*   **Fermented Foods:** Can improve gut bacterial diversity but may not be a substitute for adequate fiber intake.
*   **Probiotics:**
    *   **Personalized Approach:** The most effective strategy involves testing one's gut microbiome to identify specific deficiencies or imbalances and then selecting targeted probiotics or dietary interventions.
    *   **Supplementation Challenges:** Probiotic viability, survival through stomach acidity, and the sheer scale of the gut ecosystem make single-strain supplements less impactful for some.
    *   **AI and Future of Probiotics:** Future approaches will likely involve AI to analyze microbiome composition and function, predicting optimal probiotic and prebiotic interventions.

## Other Considerations

*   **Glutamine:** Some evidence suggests it can improve gut barrier function, but lifestyle interventions like high-fiber diets and exercise are generally considered more fundamental.
*   **Apple Cider Vinegar:** Contains acetic acid, a short-chain fatty acid. While it may offer some benefits when absorbed in the small intestine, its maximal impact might require it to reach the colon. Dose-response is important, as too much can lead to negative effects.
*   **Individual Variability:** What works for one person may not work for another due to genetic and lifestyle factors. Tracking personal biomarkers and symptoms is key.
