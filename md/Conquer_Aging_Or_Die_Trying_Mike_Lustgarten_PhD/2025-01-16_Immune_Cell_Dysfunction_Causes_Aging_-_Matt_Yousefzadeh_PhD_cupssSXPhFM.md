# 2025-01-16 Immune Cell Dysfunction Causes Aging - Matt Yousefzadeh PhD

### Executive Summary

*   Mitochondrial dysfunction specifically in T cells can drive a strong premature aging phenotype in solid organs.
*   Normal immune cells transition into a senescent state due to factors such as impaired DNA repair, loss of mitochondrial maintenance proteins, or age-related endogenous damage and stress.
*   Senescent immune cells adopt a secretory phenotype, which subsequently induces secondary senescence in other immune cells, epithelial cells, and various other cell types.
*   A two-phase mechanism contributes to systemic aging: senescent immune cells actively contribute to the accumulation of cellular "trash" while simultaneously losing their inherent capability to remove it.
*   This dual mechanism drives profound inter-organ communication of aging, ultimately leading to systemic age.

## Mechanisms of Immune Cell-Driven Aging

Mitochondrial dysfunction, specifically within T cells, has been shown to induce a robust premature aging phenotype in solid organs. The underlying process involves the transformation of normal immune cells into senescent immune cells.

This senescence can be triggered by:
*   Loss of DNA repair mechanisms.
*   Removal of mitochondrial maintenance proteins.
*   Development of endogenous damage or stress over time due to age.

**Path to Senescence and Systemic Aging:**

Normal Immune Cell
-> (Loss of DNA repair OR Removal of mitochondrial maintenance protein OR Age-related endogenous damage/stress)
-> Senescent Immune Cell
-> Takes on Secretory Phenotype
-> Causes Secondary Senescence (in other immune cells, epithelial cells, or various other cell types)

This process represents a two-phase mechanism driving systemic aging. Senescent immune cells contribute to the buildup of cellular "trash" (e.g., senescent cells) while simultaneously losing their functional capacity to perform their job of clearing this "trash." This profound inter-organ communication of aging ultimately leads to systemic age.
