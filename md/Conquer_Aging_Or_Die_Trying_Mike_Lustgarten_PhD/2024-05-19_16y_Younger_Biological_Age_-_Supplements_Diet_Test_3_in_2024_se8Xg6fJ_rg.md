# 2024-05-19 16y Younger Biological Age - Supplements Diet Test 3 in 2024

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age was calculated as 16.1 years younger than chronological age using Dr. Morgan Levine's PhenoAge calculator.
*   The dietary approach for this period maintained a 99.2% clean diet with an average daily intake of 2077 calories, close to the lowest recorded intake since 2015.
*   Key dietary experiments included increasing LDL through eggs and coconut butter to investigate its correlation with a slower epigenetic pace of aging, and doubling clover sprout intake to boost NAD levels.
*   The net macronutrient distribution was 47.6% fat, 33% net carbohydrates, and 19.4% protein, factoring in the conversion of soluble fiber to short-chain fatty acids.
*   Micronutrient intake emphasized high levels of specific vitamins (e.g., Vitamin K at 25x RDA) based on observed positive correlations with a panel of 25 biomarkers.

## Biological Age

For blood test number three in 2024, biological age was 16.1 years younger than chronological age, determined by the PhenoAge calculator.

## Prescriptions & Supplements

*   **Prescription:** Levothyroxine 137.5 micrograms per day for hypothyroidism (since diagnosis in twenties).
*   **Supplements (56-day period from March 4 to April 28):**
    *   **Vitamin D:** 1000 IU per day, taken for all 56 days.
    *   **Methyl B12:** 1000 micrograms per day, taken for 21 of the 56 days. Goal: Potentially lower homocysteine. Observed impact: 10% or less reduction on homocysteine.
        *   *Future Strategy:* Increasing branch chain amino acid (BCAA) levels is being explored to further reduce homocysteine.
    *   **Nicotinic Acid:** 50-60 milligrams per day, taken for 28 of the 56 days. Goal: Increase NAD. Intake was primarily on exercise days to maximize NAD boost when potentially most needed.
*   No other purported geoprotectors or senolytics were used.

## Diet Composition & Methodology

Dietary intake was tracked daily, involving weighing all food, entering data into Cronometer, and manually transcribing to a spreadsheet. The following averages are for the 56-day period corresponding to blood test number three. A total of 54 different foods were consumed. The diet was 99.2% clean, with cheat meals (chocolate mixed with peanut butter, sometimes with added sugar/honey/sweetened condensed milk) accounting for 0.8% of total calories (606 calories from chocolate chips, 311 calories from sugar over two days).

Foods were ranked by mass, with green tea measured in ounces. The top 10 foods ranked by caloric contribution were largely consistent with Test 2, with 9 of 10 foods remaining on the list. Sardines continued to be the top source of calories, indicating the inclusion of fish in the diet, as biomarkers show improvement with its consumption. Peanut intake was increased as a rich source of tryptophan butane (which declines with aging), replacing almonds to maintain calorie balance. Pistachios entered the top 10 for the first time.

## Dietary Experiments

Two main dietary experiments were conducted for this test, aiming to improve specific biomarkers without disrupting overall stability.

*   **Experiment 1: LDL and Epigenetic Pace of Aging**
    *   **Rationale:** In personal data, relatively higher levels of LDL are significantly correlated with a slower epigenetic pace of aging.
    *   **Protocol:**
        *   Added 5 eggs per week.
        *   Increased coconut butter intake by a few grams per day.
    *   **Goal:** Slowly increase LDL levels above the normal range to test this correlation. Data from epigenetic testing for this correlation is pending.

*   **Experiment 2: Clover Sprouts and NAD Levels**
    *   **Rationale:** Crimson (red) clover seeds, used for sprouting, contain high levels of Trigonelline, which has been shown to increase NAD in mice.
    *   **Protocol:**
        *   Average intake: 73 grams of clover sprouts per day.
        *   Intensified intake: For 11 days prior to the blood test, clover sprout intake was doubled to 250 grams per day.
    *   **Goal:** Increase NAD levels.

## Macronutrient Breakdown

*   **Calorie Intake:** Average daily calorie intake was 2077 kcal, which is close to the lowest average daily intake recorded since diet tracking began in April 2015 (previous low: 2076 kcal).
    *   *Future Experiment (for Test 4):* Calorie intake will be purposely increased slightly to investigate its impact on red blood cells, hemoglobin, and SHBG levels.
*   **Protein Intake:** 101 grams per day, representing 19.4% of total calories.
*   **Fat Intake:** 90 grams per day, representing 39.1% of total calories. This was a 6-gram increase from Test 2 (84 g/day), primarily from saturated fat (coconut butter) to increase LDL, and a small increase from monounsaturated fatty acids (partly due to increased peanut intake). Omega-3 and Omega-6 intakes remained consistent (9.5 g and 16 g, respectively).
*   **Carbohydrate Intake:**
    *   Total carbs: 257 grams per day.
    *   Fiber intake: 87 grams per day.
    *   Net carbs: 171 grams per day (Total carbs - Fiber), yielding 33% of total daily calories.
    *   Fiber contribution to calories: Soluble fiber (approximately 20% of total fiber) is fermented by gut bacteria into short-chain fatty acids, contributing calories to the diet. For this test, approximately 178 calories (8.5% of total calories) were potentially converted from fiber into fat.

*   **Net Macronutrient Distribution (accounting for fiber conversion):**
    *   Fat: 47.6%
    *   Net Carbs: 33%
    *   Protein: 19.4%

*   **Fructose Intake:** Total fructose intake was 59 grams per day. This is calculated by taking half of the sucrose intake (sucrose is half fructose) and adding it to other fructose sources.
    *   **Rationale:** In personal data, higher total fructose intake significantly correlates with more biomarkers moving in an unfavorable direction.
    *   Fructose intake for this test was close to the lowest recorded (57.5 g/day since 2015).
    *   *Future Experiment (for Test 4):* Efforts have been made to further reduce fructose intake below 57.5 g/day to observe any additional impact on biomarkers.

## Micronutrient Intake

*   **Vitamins:** Full Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) coverage was met for all vitamins. Many vitamin levels were purposefully much higher than the RDA, based on positive correlations with a panel of approximately 25 biomarkers representing various organ systems.
    *   **Example:** Vitamin K intake was approximately 2550 micrograms per day (25 times the Adequate Intake of 100 micrograms per day) due to its net positive correlative score with the biomarker panel.
    *   Choline intake was slightly higher due to the addition of eggs, which are a rich source of choline.
*   **Minerals:** Mineral intake was almost identical to Test 2, reflecting a consistent approach of making small, targeted changes.
    *   *Future Experiment (for Test 4):* Selenium intake has been increased to the tolerable upper limit of 400 micrograms per day. This is primarily sourced from whole foods like Brazil nuts and mushrooms.
        *   **Biological Process:** Free T4 -> (Selenium-dependent conversion) -> Free T3
        *   **Rationale:** Selenium is required for the conversion of the thyroid hormone free T4 into free T3.
