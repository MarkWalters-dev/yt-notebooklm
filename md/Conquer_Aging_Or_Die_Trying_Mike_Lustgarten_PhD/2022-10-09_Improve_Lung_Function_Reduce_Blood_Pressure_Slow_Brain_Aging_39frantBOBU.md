# 2022-10-09 Improve Lung Function Reduce Blood Pressure Slow Brain Aging

## Executive Summary
* Forced Expiratory Volume in one second ($\text{FEV}_1$) declines with age and is a strong predictor of chronological age (third best in men, second best in women).
* Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT), specifically when performed at greater than 50% of Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP), significantly improved $\text{FEV}_1$ (7.7% increase in one study).
* Inspiratory Muscle Strength Training (IMST) has been consistently shown across multiple studies to reduce Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), irrespective of baseline SBP or age group.
* Optimal blood pressure (less than $115/75 \text{ mmHg}$) is associated with younger brain age as assessed by MRI.

## Comprehensive Biomarker Tracking Approach
The goal is to delay aging and extend lifespan by tracking and optimizing multiple organ and systemic health biomarkers, moving beyond standard metabolic markers (glucose, lipid panel).

**Categories of Tracked Biomarkers:**
1.  **Metabolic Markers:** Glucose, Lipid Panel.
2.  **Immune Markers:** White blood cells (leukocytes), Erythrocytes (red blood cells), Thrombocytes (platelets), C-reactive protein.
3.  **Liver Function Markers:** Alanine transaminase ($\text{AST}$), Albumin (Alkaline phosphatase included in the "big, big picture" list).
4.  **Kidney Function Markers:** Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen ($\text{BUN}$), Uric Acid.
5.  **Cardiovascular Markers (Daily):** Resting Heart Rate ($\text{RHR}$), Heart Rate Variability ($\text{HRV}$).
6.  **Musculoskeletal:** Leanness and fitness assessments.

## Lung Function ($\text{FEV}_1$) and Aging
Forced Expiratory Volume in one second ($\text{FEV}_1$) is the volume of air forcefully expired in one second.
*   $\text{FEV}_1$ peaks around 20 years of age and subsequently declines steadily throughout life.
*   $\text{FEV}_1$ is a top predictor of chronological age:
    *   In men, $\text{FEV}_1$ was the third best predictor of chronological age.
    *   In women, $\text{FEV}_1$ was the second best predictor of chronological age.
*   In men, $\text{FEV}_1$ was a better predictor of age than blood-based biomarkers like Cystatin C, Urea, Testosterone, and $\text{IGF}-1$.
*   The best overall predictor of chronological age identified was Systolic Blood Pressure ($\text{SBP}$).

**Personal $\text{FEV}_1$ Measurement Protocol:**
*   Device used was a spirometer peer-reviewed as equivalent to clinical office measurements.
*   To minimize variability, nine measurements were taken daily, and the highest value was recorded.
*   Average $\text{FEV}_1$ over the last month: $3.27 \text{ L/s}$.
*   Expected $\text{FEV}_1$ based on chronological age: $3.7 \text{ L/s}$.
*   Observed $\text{FEV}_1$ corresponds to an age 11-12 years older than chronological age.
*   Youthful values are near $4.5 \text{ L/s}$.

## Improving $\text{FEV}_1$ via Muscle Training
$\text{FEV}_1$ reflects expiratory muscle strength, but research focuses heavily on Inspiratory Muscle Training ($\text{IMT}$).

**Inspiratory Muscle Training ($\text{IMT}$) Study (Long Distance Runners, $\text{N} \approx 24$ average age):**
*   **Protocol:** 8 weeks, training 5 days/week, 30 inspirations/day.
*   **Mechanism:** Breathing against external resistance, not just deep breathing.

| Group | Device/Resistance Level | $\text{FEV}_1$ Change vs. Baseline |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Group 1 | PowerBreathe ($\text{IMT}$); $50-70\%$ of Maximal Inspiratory Pressure ($\text{MIP}$) | $7.7\%$ Significant Increase |
| Group 2 | Threshold ($\text{IMT}$); $30-50\%$ of $\text{MIP}$ | No Change |
| Group 3 | Control (No $\text{IMT}$) | No Change |

**Conclusion from IMT Data:** $\text{IMT}$ training at greater than $50\%$ of $\text{MIP}$ may be required to improve $\text{FEV}_1$.

## Link between Lung Function, Blood Pressure, and Brain Age
A proposed pathway suggests that improving lung function ($\text{FEV}_1$) reduces blood pressure ($\text{BP}$), which may slow brain aging.

### IMST and Blood Pressure Reduction
Inspiratory Muscle Strength Training ($\text{IMST}$) has been shown to reduce $\text{SBP}$ across various populations:
*   Data from six studies (young adults, middle-aged/older adults, and those with obstructive sleep apnea) showed $\text{SBP}$ was significantly reduced post-training.
*   Improvements were observed regardless of whether the starting $\text{SBP}$ was relatively low (e.g., $110-120 \text{ mmHg}$) or higher (e.g., $130-140 \text{ mmHg}$).

**Combined Effect:** $\text{IMST}$ improves lung function ($\text{FEV}_1$) and reduces $\text{SBP}$.

### Blood Pressure and Brain Age
A study assessing brain age via $\text{MRI}$ found that people with blood pressure values less than $115/75 \text{ mmHg}$ exhibited a relatively younger brain age.

**Personal Blood Pressure Tracking (55 data points over 3 years):**
*   **Average $\text{SBP}$:** $123.2 \text{ mmHg}$. (Expected $\text{SBP}$ based on age: $125 \text{ mmHg}$). This suggests room for improvement relative to the optimal $115 \text{ mmHg}$ threshold for younger brain age.
*   **Average Diastolic Blood Pressure ($\text{DBP}$):** $75 \text{ mmHg}$. (This meets the threshold of less than $75 \text{ mmHg}$ associated with younger brain age).

## Proposed Intervention
The speaker hypothesizes that $\text{IMST}$ can improve two organ systems (lungs and cardiovascular) and potentially a third (brain age) by optimizing $\text{SBP}$. The maximal benefit is anticipated by using a combined device that trains both inspiratory and expiratory muscles.
