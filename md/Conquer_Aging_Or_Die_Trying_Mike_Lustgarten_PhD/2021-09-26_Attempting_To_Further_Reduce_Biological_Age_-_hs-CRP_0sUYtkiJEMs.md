# 2021-09-26 Attempting To Further Reduce Biological Age - hs-CRP

## Executive Summary

*   High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels generally increase with age and higher levels are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   In personal data, higher High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) levels are significantly correlated with lower hs-CRP levels.
*   Higher dietary intake of total carbohydrates and total fructose is significantly correlated with lower HDL levels.
*   Reducing fructose intake may indirectly lower hs-CRP by increasing HDL, and it may also improve other biomarkers such as uric acid, red blood cell count, and Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW).
*   The speaker aims to reduce daily fructose intake to consistently increase HDL and subsequently decrease hs-CRP to improve biological age markers.

## Understanding hs-CRP

The speaker's biological age is 35.7 years, approximately 13 years younger than chronological age, with room for improvement, specifically by reducing high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP).

*   **General Population Trends:** Median CRP values increase with age. For individuals aged 18-30, the median CRP is around 1 mg/L, rising in older age groups.
*   **Personal CRP Data:** Over 16 blood tests in three years, the speaker's average CRP is 0.53 mg/L, with a recent value of 0.57 mg/L. Past values have ranged from 0.2 mg/L to 1 mg/L.
*   **Significance:** CRP levels increase during aging, and relatively higher levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk. Identifying factors that impact CRP can potentially slow the age-related increase and reduce this risk.

## Dietary Macronutrients and hs-CRP

The speaker analyzed correlations between dietary macronutrients and hs-CRP over 16 blood tests.

*   **Investigated Macronutrients:** Calories, total carbohydrate, total fructose, fiber, total fat, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), omega-3, omega-6, saturated fat, and protein.
*   **Finding:** None of the investigated macronutrients were significantly correlated with hs-CRP.

## hs-CRP and "Big Picture" Biomarkers

Correlations between hs-CRP and broader biomarkers of organ and systemic health were investigated.

*   **No Significant Correlation with:**
    *   Glucose
    *   Kidney function markers (e.g., creatinine)
    *   Liver function markers
    *   Immune cells
    *   Red blood cell related measures (Red Blood Cells, Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW))
*   **Significant Correlations:**
    *   **Total Cholesterol:** Relatively higher levels of total cholesterol were correlated with lower levels of hs-CRP.
    *   **HDL:** Relatively higher levels of HDL were significantly correlated with lower levels of hs-CRP.
    *   **LDL:** Relatively higher levels of LDL showed a similar trend towards lower hs-CRP but were not statistically significant.
    *   **Phenotypic Age:** Higher hs-CRP was significantly correlated with an older phenotypic age (expected, as hs-CRP is a component of this biological age calculation).
    *   **Aging.ai Biological Age:** No significant correlation.

## Dietary Factors Impacting HDL

Given the significant inverse correlation between HDL and hs-CRP, the speaker investigated which dietary factors impact HDL, utilizing 32 blood tests with dietary data since 2015.

*   **No Significant Correlation with HDL:**
    *   Total calories
    *   Total fiber intake
    *   Monounsaturated fatty acids
    *   Omega-3
    *   Omega-6
    *   Total protein intake
    *   Dietary cholesterol
*   **Significant Correlations with HDL (Higher intake correlated with lower HDL):**
    *   Total carbohydrate intake
    *   Total fructose intake
*   **Near Significant Correlations with HDL (Higher intake correlated with lower HDL):**
    *   Total fat intake
    *   Saturated fat intake

### Hypothesis: Indirect Effect on hs-CRP

The speaker's data suggests an indirect pathway where dietary factors influence HDL, which then impacts hs-CRP:

Dietary Carbohydrates/Fructose -> Lower HDL -> Higher hs-CRP

This hypothesis is supported by the lack of direct significant correlation between carbohydrate/fructose intake and hs-CRP, despite a trend.

## Fructose and HDL Relationship

Analysis of 32 blood tests shows a clear inverse correlation: higher average daily fructose intake is correlated with lower HDL.

*   **Fructose Intake Range:** The speaker's average daily fructose intake has ranged from 71 g/day to 128 g/day.
*   **Target for HDL:** To achieve HDL levels greater than 50 mg/dL, an average daily fructose intake of less than 70 g/day, ideally closer to 60 g/day, is suggested.

## Fructose and Other "Big Picture" Biomarkers

The net correlative effect of dietary fructose on various biomarkers was analyzed.

*   **Positive Correlation (higher fructose -> beneficial change):**
    *   **Glucose:** Higher fructose intake was correlated with lower glucose levels. (Note: Speaker's fructose is exclusively from fruits and vegetables, not added sugars, potentially reflecting higher berry intake.)
*   **Negative Correlations (higher fructose -> detrimental change):**
    *   **HDL:** As discussed, higher fructose correlated with lower HDL.
    *   **Uric Acid:** Higher fructose intake was correlated with higher uric acid levels. Higher uric acid is associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Red Blood Cells (RBC):** Higher fructose intake was correlated with lower RBC levels. RBC counts decline with aging, so lower levels are undesirable.
    *   **Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW):** Higher fructose intake was correlated with a higher RDW. RDW increases with aging, and higher levels are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   **No Significant Correlation with Fructose:**
    *   Homocysteine
    *   Creatinine (kidney function)
    *   Liver function markers
    *   Remaining lipoproteins (total cholesterol, LDL, VLDL, lipoprotein(a))
    *   Immune/immune-related cells
    *   MCV
    *   hs-CRP (reinforcing the indirect effect hypothesis)
    *   Overall biological age scores (Levin's PhenoAge, Aging.ai)

## Conclusion on Fructose

Considering the net correlative effect, fructose intake shows one positive correlation (glucose) and four negative correlations (HDL, uric acid, RBC, RDW). This suggests that limiting fructose intake could lead to improvements in HDL, potentially reduce hs-CRP, and improve other crucial biomarkers.

## Current Action

Since the last blood test, the speaker has reduced average daily fructose intake to approximately 69 g/day over 24 days, marking the lowest average intake in six years. The goal is to further reduce this towards 60 g/day.

## Future Outlook

The speaker anticipates that continued reduction in fructose intake will lead to increased HDL levels and subsequently decreased hs-CRP in future blood tests.
