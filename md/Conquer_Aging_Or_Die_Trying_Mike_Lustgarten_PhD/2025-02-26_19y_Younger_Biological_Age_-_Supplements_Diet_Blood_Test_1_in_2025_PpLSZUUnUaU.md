# 2025-02-26 19y Younger Biological Age - Supplements Diet Blood Test 1 in 2025

## Executive Summary

*   Blood test results in February 2025 indicate a biological age 19 years younger than chronological age, as measured by the PhenoAge calculator.
*   Key dietary shifts included a reduction in sardine intake and an increase in wild-caught salmon to incorporate astaxanthin.
*   Alfalfa sprouts were reintroduced into the diet to potentially mitigate age-related increases in systolic blood pressure.
*   Blueberries were reincorporated into the diet despite prior negative correlative scores, as they did not negatively impact biological age.
*   Average daily calorie intake remained consistent with previous tests, with a focus on avoiding extremely low calorie periods to support lymphocyte levels.

## Prescription Medications

*   **Levothyroxine:** Currently taking for hypothyroidism. The free T3 to free T4 ratio has been low and relatively aged. The goal is to switch to Cytomel (T3) to improve this ratio.

## Supplements

*   **Vitamin D:** 2,000 IU daily for the 49 days preceding the blood test.
*   **Nicotinic Acid (Niacin):** Supplemented at 201 mg/day for the week prior to testing to raise NAD levels. NAD levels on testing day were 48 micromolar, significantly higher than the baseline of 20-30 micromolar.
*   **N-Acetylcysteine (NAC):** 1.5 grams/day for the last 38 days of the 49-day period, preceded by 2 days of 1 gram/day. Despite trials showing homocysteine reduction with 1.5g/day NAC, homocysteine remained at 9.8 micromolar.

## Diet

The following represents the average daily dietary intake for the 49-day period preceding blood test #1, 2025. Data is tracked daily using a food scale and Cronometer.

*   **Top Foods by Grams (with exceptions noted):**
    *   Strawberries: ~400 grams/day (reduced from ~530 grams/day)
    *   Coffee: 1 x 20 oz brewed coffee over the 49-day period (not daily)
    *   Blueberries: ~5 ounces/day (reintroduced)
    *   Alfalfa Sprouts: 113 grams/day (reintroduced)
    *   Wild Caught Salmon: Increased intake, aiming for a 50/50 mix with sardines.
    *   Sardines: Reduced intake, aiming for a 50/50 mix with salmon.
    *   Oranges: Increased by ~30 grams/day previously, now removed due to lack of correlation with DHEA sulfate.
    *   Yogurt: Entered top 10 calorie contributors.
    *   Walnuts: Left top 10 calorie contributors.

*   **Dietary Experiments:**
    *   **Alfalfa Sprouts:** Reintroduced (113g/day) with the aim of lowering systolic blood pressure.
    *   **Sardine Reduction & Salmon Increase:** Decreased sardine intake to incorporate wild-caught salmon for astaxanthin, which has shown lifespan extension in Little mice and positive effects on skin and eyes in clinical trials. Future plans include a 50/50 mix or a full switch to salmon.
    *   **Orange Reduction & Blueberry Reintroduction:** Oranges were removed due to a lack of positive correlation with DHEA sulfate. Blueberries were reintroduced (~5oz/day) despite prior negative correlative scores, as biological age did not worsen.
    *   **Fructose Neutrality:** Strawberry intake was reduced to offset increased blueberry intake, maintaining a target for low fructose consumption due to its negative correlation with biomarkers.

*   **Cheat Meals:**
    *   Incorporated immediately after blood testing to avoid binges.
    *   **Meal 1:** Peanut butter mixed with chocolate, sugar, and heavy cream (to soften chocolate).
    *   **Meal 2:** Homemade ice cream (heavy cream, sugar, blueberries).
    *   **Junk Calories:** 859 calories from junk over the 49-day period, representing 0.8% of total calories.

*   **Top 10 Foods by Average Daily Calorie Intake (Test #8, 2024 to Test #1, 2025):**
    1.  Strawberries
    2.  Salmon (Wild Caught)
    3.  Yogurt
    4.  Blueberries
    5.  Chicken Breast
    6.  Ground Beef
    7.  Eggs
    8.  Almonds
    9.  Sardines
    10. Olive Oil

## Macronutrients

*   **Average Daily Calorie Intake:** 2,121 calories/day. This is intentionally not at the lowest possible intake (2,076 calories/day) to help maintain lymphocyte levels, which have been declining.
*   **Protein Intake:** 95 grams/day (18% of total calories).
*   **Fat Intake:** 89 grams/day (38% of total calories).
    *   Includes breakdown of monounsaturated, omega-3, omega-6, and saturated fats.
*   **Carbohydrate Intake:**
    *   Total Carbs: 275 grams/day.
    *   Net Carbs: 197 grams/day.
    *   Net Carbs as % of Total Calories: 37%.
    *   **Estimated Fiber Converted to Fat:** ~7% of total calories (from ~153 calories).
*   **Net Macros (including fiber converted to fat):**
    *   Fat: 45%
    *   Net Carbs: 37%
    *   Protein: 18%

*   **Fructose Intake:** Average fructose intake was approximately 63 grams/day (including sucrose). This is on the lower end of the individual's historical range.

## Micronutrients

*   **Vitamins and Minerals:** General aim is to achieve at least the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for all vitamins and minerals, with specific nutrients intentionally pushed higher based on iterative testing and correlation analysis.
*   **Vitamin K:** Intake is 2,500 micrograms/day, significantly higher than the RDA (90-120 micrograms/day).
*   **Vitamin B12:** Approximately 8 micrograms/day (compared to 12 micrograms/day for test #8), primarily due to reduced sardine and fish intake. This will be increased for the next test.
*   **Niacin:** Total intake (including nicotinic acid supplementation) was approximately 40 milligrams/day higher than for test #8, reflecting the specific supplementation regimen in the 7 days prior to testing.

## Mouse Data (Implicit Reference)

*   Astaxanthin, found in salmon, has been shown to increase lifespan in Little mice.

## Human Evidence (Implicit Reference)

*   Astaxanthin has been shown in clinical trials to have positive effects on skin and eyes.
*   Two clinical trials have shown a reduction in homocysteine in response to 1.5 grams/day of N-Acetylcysteine.
