# 2020-07-19 Is Weight Loss Driving Improvements For Resting Heart Rate And Heart Rate Variability

## Executive Summary

*   Weight loss trended concurrently with improvements in resting heart rate (RHR) and heart rate variability (HRV) over a two-year period.
*   A statistically significant, albeit moderate, negative correlation was observed between body weight and RHR (r = 0.4), with body weight explaining 16% of RHR variance.
*   A weak but statistically significant negative correlation was found between body weight and HRV (r = 0.25), with body weight explaining 66% of HRV variance.
*   Daily calorie intake showed a moderate negative correlation with RHR (r = 0.54), explaining 29% of RHR variance, and a weak negative correlation with HRV (r = 0.14), explaining 2% of HRV variance.
*   Reducing calorie intake to achieve sustained weight loss may contribute to improvements in RHR and HRV, in addition to consistent exercise.

## Human Evidence

### Personal Data Analysis

The analysis focuses on personal physiological data collected over a two-year period (August 2018 - July 2020), examining the relationship between body weight, calorie intake, resting heart rate (RHR), and heart rate variability (HRV).

#### Body Weight Trends vs. Resting Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability

*   **Observation:** Plots of average monthly body weight and RHR over the two-year period showed highly similar trends. Periods of weight reduction were associated with lower RHR, while periods of weight increase were associated with higher RHR. A small uptick in RHR was noted in the last few months of data, coinciding with a slight increase in body weight.

#### Correlation Analysis: Body Weight vs. Physiological Metrics

*   **Resting Heart Rate vs. Body Weight:**
    *   A moderate correlation (r = 0.4) was observed between daily body weight and daily RHR.
    *   Body weight explained 16% of the variance in RHR.
    *   This correlation was statistically significant (p = 8.4 x 10^-29).
*   **Heart Rate Variability vs. Body Weight:**
    *   A weak but statistically significant correlation (r = 0.25) was found between daily body weight and daily HRV.
    *   Higher body weight was associated with lower HRV, and lower body weight was associated with higher HRV.
    *   Body weight explained 66% of the variance in HRV.
    *   This correlation was statistically significant (p = 8.8 x 10^-12).

#### Calorie Intake Trends vs. Physiological Metrics

*   **Methodology for Calorie Tracking:**
    *   Daily calorie intake was meticulously tracked by weighing all food.
    *   Food intake was logged into an online application to determine macronutrient and micronutrient breakdown.
    *   This detailed data was then logged into an Excel file.
    *   Daily body weight was recorded at the same time each morning after using the toilet.
*   **Calorie Intake vs. Resting Heart Rate:**
    *   A moderate strength correlation (r = 0.54) was observed between daily calorie intake and RHR.
    *   Higher calorie intake was associated with higher RHR.
    *   Daily calorie intake explained 29% of the variance in RHR.
    *   This correlation was highly statistically significant (p = 1.6 x 10^-55).
*   **Calorie Intake vs. Heart Rate Variability:**
    *   A weak but statistically significant correlation (r = 0.14) was found between daily calorie intake and HRV.
    *   Higher calorie intake was associated with lower HRV.
    *   Daily calorie intake explained 2% of the variance in HRV.
    *   This correlation was statistically significant (p = 8.8 x 10^-5).

### Implications for Health Improvement

*   Consistent exercise training is expected to improve RHR and HRV.
*   Based on the personal data presented, weight loss, potentially driven by a reduction in calorie intake, may also be a significant factor in improving RHR and HRV.
*   Monitoring and reducing calorie intake to achieve gradual weight loss and improve body composition could be beneficial for enhancing cardiovascular health metrics.
