# 2024-12-20 Antiviral Medication Use Is Associated With Reduced Dementia Risk - Amy Proal PhD

**Executive Summary:**
*   A Taiwanese population study linked the use of anti-herpes virus medications to a significantly reduced risk of dementia.
*   Individuals taking herpes virus antivirals exhibited almost a 10-fold lower risk of developing dementia over time.
*   Commonly prescribed medications like Valcyte were among those examined.
*   Ben Reidhead's group is planning a clinical trial to evaluate valganciclovir, a herpes antiviral, in pre-dementia patients to assess its potential in preventing progression to Alzheimer's disease.

## Human Evidence: Taiwanese Population Study

*   **Study Team:** Researchers in Taiwan.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Accessed medical records from a database covering thousands of people in the population.
    *   Identified individuals who had frequently taken herpes virus medications (e.g., Valcyte).
    *   Compared this group to individuals who had not been prescribed these medications.
*   **Findings:**
    *   Participants taking anti-herpes virus medications had a significantly lower risk of developing dementia over time.
    *   This reduction in risk was substantial, nearly 10 times lower for those using the widely available herpes virus antivirals.

## Future Research: Planned Clinical Trial

*   Ben Reidhead's research group is working to secure funding and infrastructure for a clinical trial.
*   **Intervention:** The trial will test valganciclovir, a specific herpes antiviral.
*   **Participants:** Patients with pre-dementia.
*   **Objective:** To determine if valganciclovir can prevent the progression to Alzheimer's disease.
