# 2025-06-01 Supplements Diet That Correspond To A 17y Younger Biological Age Test 3 in 2025

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age was found to be 17 years younger than chronological age using the PhenoAge calculator in blood test number three for 2025.
*   Thyroid hormone dosage was adjusted to a lower Levothyroxine dose (88 mcg/day) and added Cytomel (15 mcg/day) to improve the free T3 to free T4 ratio.
*   Supplementation with nicotinic acid (102 mg/day) for seven days prior to testing resulted in intracellular NAD levels of approximately 30 micromolar.
*   A mega-dose of riboflavin (600 mg/day) did not impact NAD levels but may have contributed to a reduction in homocysteine.
*   The diet for this test period closely replicated the diet from test number two, which corresponded to a 22-year younger biological age, suggesting the diet is a significant factor in maintaining a younger biological age.

## Prescription Medications

### Thyroid Hormone Adjustment

*   **Previous Protocol:** Levothyroxine 137.5 mcg/day.
*   **Issue:** Free T3 to free T4 ratio was low (around 0.2), equivalent to a 90-year-old.
*   **New Protocol (started April 11, 11 days before testing):**
    *   Levothyroxine (T4): 88 mcg/day
    *   Cytomel (T3): 15 mcg/day
*   **Goal:** Achieve a free T3 to free T4 ratio of approximately 0.4.
*   **Result for Test 3:** Ratio was approximately 0.3, showing positive movement.

## Supplements

### Vitamin D

*   **Dosage:** 2000 IU/day for the entire 35-day period between tests.
*   **Rationale:** Compensates for limited sun exposure in Boston.

### Nicotinic Acid (Niacin)

*   **Dosage:** 102 mg/day for seven days prior to testing.
*   **Rationale:** To maintain intracellular NAD levels from being low (< 20 micromolar).
*   **Testing:** Intracellular NAD levels were tested via GINFINITY on the day of blood test 3.
*   **Result for Test 3:** NAD levels were approximately 30 micromolar.
*   **Comparison:** This is higher than the baseline (25 micromolar) but lower than levels seen in test 2 (43 micromolar) with the same nicotinic acid dosage, suggesting variability or other influencing factors (diet).

### Riboflavin (Vitamin B2)

*   **Dosage:** 600 mg/day (mega-dose, significantly higher than typical intake).
*   **Primary Rationale:** Reduce homocysteine by acting as a cofactor in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine.
*   **Secondary Observation:** Riboflavin is involved in de novo NAD synthesis.
*   **Impact on NAD:** Did not positively impact blood intracellular NAD levels.
*   **Impact on Homocysteine:** Contributed to a reduction in homocysteine, alongside a stack of Methylfolate, B12, and B6.

### Homocysteine Reduction Stack

*   **Supplementation Period:** For 26 of the 35 days corresponding to test 3, specifically the 26 days *before* the test.
*   **Components:**
    *   Methylfolate: 1000 mcg
    *   Vitamin B12: 400 mcg
    *   Vitamin B6: 1.5 mg (included in a single supplement)
*   **Result for Test 3:** Homocysteine levels moved from 11 to 9 micromolar.
*   **Desired Level:** Around 5 micromolar, which was observed approximately 20 years ago.
*   **Unsuccessful Attempts:** TMG (4 grams) did not impact homocysteine in this individual.
*   **Future Experiment Consideration:** Zinc, as a required cofactor in betaine + homocysteine -> methionine conversion.

## Diet

### General Approach

*   **Dietary Tracking:** All food weighed and entered into Cronometer for precise intake data.
*   **Duration:** 35-day period between blood test 2 and blood test 3.
*   **Number of Foods:** 46 different foods consumed.
*   **Exceptions:** Ice cream sandwiches (in calories), green tea (in ounces).
*   **Experiment Status for Test 3:** No specific dietary experiments were conducted; the goal was to repeat the diet from test 2.

### Diet Replication (Test 3 vs. Test 2)

*   **Goal:** Replicate the diet from test 2, which corresponded to a 22-year younger biological age, to confirm its impact.
*   **Outcome:** Biological age for test 3 was 17 years younger, with an average biological age over the two tests around 20 years younger.
*   **Top 13 Foods (by grams):** The same 13 foods were consumed in both tests, with a slightly different order.
*   **Top 10 Foods (by calories):** The same foods were consumed in both tests, with a slightly different order.

### Cheat Meals

*   **Timing:** Immediately after blood testing and metabolomics sample submission.
*   **Protocol:**
    *   Day 1: Entire box of ice cream sandwiches.
    *   Day 2: Standard mix of peanut butter, chocolate, and sweetened condensed milk.
*   **Calorie Control:** Crucially, stayed within daily calorie goals (around 2400-2500 kcal on test day, 2100-2200 kcal the day after).
*   **Total Junk Calories:** 1833 kcal (1330 from ice cream, 293 from chocolate chips, 211 from sweetened condensed milk).
*   **Diet Cleanliness:** 97.6% clean diet for the 35-day period.
*   **Washout Period:** 33 days of completely clean eating between cheat meals and the next blood test.

### Top Foods by Calories

*   **Walnuts:** Ranked first for the second test in a row.
*   **Hypothesis:** Walnuts (due to omega-6 content) may be contributing to higher homocysteine levels.
*   **Note:** Omega-6 from whole foods may have different effects than from processed oils.

### Macronutrient Breakdown

*   **Average Daily Calorie Intake:** 2199 kcal.
*   **Protein:** 101 grams (18% of total calories), same as test 2.
*   **Fat:** 111 grams (45.5% of total calories).
    *   **Note:** This is the highest fat intake over the past 30 tests.
    *   **Correlation:** Higher fat intake is correlated with higher glucose/HbA1c in this individual's data.
    *   **HbA1c for Test 3:** 5.4 (higher than previous lowest values around 5).
    *   **Cystatin C:** This biomarker (predictive of grim age) was at its worst for this test (closer to 0.8 than 0.7). High fat intake is being investigated as a potential contributor.
    *   **Action Taken:** Fat intake has since been reduced to around 90 grams/day.
    *   **Omega-3:** Relatively high at 33 grams/day (primarily from walnuts).
*   **Carbohydrates:**
    *   **Total Carbs:** 240 grams/day.
    *   **Fiber:** 66 grams/day (lowest intake since 2015).
    *   **Net Carbs:** 173.5 grams/day (31.6% of total calories).
    *   **Fiber Calories (SCFA):** 4.5% of total calories (199 kcal/day).
*   **Net Macros (including SCFA):**
    *   Fat: 50%
    *   Net Carbs: 32%
    *   Protein: 18%
*   **Total Fructose:** 55 grams/day (progress from a previous high of 122 grams/day).

### Micronutrients

*   **General Goal:** Achieve full Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) coverage for all vitamins and minerals.
*   **Choline:** Data for choline in sardines was not available in Cronometer. Plasma choline levels are not low, suggesting current intake is sufficient.
*   **Micronutrient Levels:** Many micronutrients are significantly higher than the RDA, guided by correlations with blood biomarkers.

## Future Outlook

*   **Test 4 Scheduled:** May 27.
*   **Data Release:** Test 4 data may be available on Patreon prior to YouTube release.
*   **Ongoing Research:** Investigating the impact of reduced fat intake (especially omega-6) and increased fiber on HbA1c and Cystatin C.
