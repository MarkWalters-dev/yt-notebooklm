# 2025-06-25 Blood Test 4 in 2025 - 17y Younger Biological Age

## Executive Summary

*   The latest blood test, using the PhenoAge biological age calculator, indicates a biological age of 35 years, which is 17.4 years younger than the chronological age.
*   Consistent testing over multiple years (61 tests since 2015) suggests that an average of at least six tests per year provides a better representation of aging rate than one or two tests annually.
*   Despite the inherent yearly increase in PhenoAge (0.9 years) even with stable biomarkers, the data shows resistance to age-related increase in biological age, indicating biomarker improvement.
*   The trend of average biological age has fluctuated but has remained within a similar range since 2020, with 2022 being the best year to date at 32.1 years.
*   The current four-test average for 2025 (32.7 years) is an improvement over the previous two years, though not as low as the 2022 average.

## Latest Biological Age Calculation

*   **Test Date:** 2025-06-25
*   **Test Count:** 61st since 2015
*   **Biological Age Calculator:** PhenoAge (Dr. Morgan Levine's)
*   **Calculated Biological Age:** 35 years
*   **Chronological Age Difference:** 17.4 years younger than chronological age

## PhenoAge Biomarker Components

PhenoAge is a biological age clock based on clinical chemistry biomarkers representing multiple organ systems:

*   **Liver Health/Function:**
    *   Albumin
    *   Alkaline Phosphatase
*   **Kidney Function:**
    *   Creatinine
*   **Metabolic Health:**
    *   Glucose
*   **Inflammation:**
    *   High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)
*   **Immune Cells:**
    *   Lymphocyte Percentage
    *   White Blood Cells
*   **Red Blood Cell Related Measures:**
    *   Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)
    *   Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW)

## Rationale for Frequent Testing

*   **Tracking Aging Rate:** Frequent testing (e.g., an average of six tests per year) provides a more robust dataset for accurately assessing the pace of aging compared to infrequent testing (one or two tests per year).
*   **Data-Driven Insights:** Gathering extensive data allows for better insights into trends and the impact of interventions on biological aging.

## Biological Age Trends (2018-2025)

Data presented as year-to-year change for biological age using PhenoAge for 41 tests from 2018 to 2025.

*   **2018-2019 (3 tests over 2 years):**
    *   Average Biological Age: 34.3 years
    *   *Note: hs-CRP was not consistently measured during this period.*
*   **2020 (6 tests):**
    *   Average Biological Age: 33.9 years
*   **2021 (6 tests):**
    *   Average Biological Age: 33.9 years
*   **2022 (7 tests):**
    *   Average Biological Age: 32.1 years (Best year to date)
*   **2023 (7 tests):**
    *   Average Biological Age: 32.9 years
*   **2024 (8 tests):**
    *   Average Biological Age: 33.1 years
*   **2025 (First 4 tests):**
    *   Current Average Biological Age: 32.7 years

## Interpretation of Trends

*   **Consistency:** While the most recent test shows a 17.4-year difference from the previous one, the year-to-year average provides a more stable picture. The four-test average for 2025 (32.7 years) is good relative to the past two years but not as low as 2022.
*   **Resistance to Age-Related Increase:** Even if biomarkers remained constant, PhenoAge naturally increases by approximately 0.9 years per year. The observed biological age being lower than this expected increase indicates actual biomarker improvement and a slowed aging rate.
*   **Focus on Slowing Aging Rate:** The goal is to slow the aging rate, which can potentially flatten mortality risk and promote longevity and healthspan, rather than "age reversal."

## Future Analysis (Parts 2 & 3)

*   **Part 2:** Detailed review of the full blood test report, including biomarkers beyond the nine used in PhenoAge to address its limitations.
*   **Part 3:** Examination of diet, supplements, and prescription medications that may contribute to the observed younger biological age.
