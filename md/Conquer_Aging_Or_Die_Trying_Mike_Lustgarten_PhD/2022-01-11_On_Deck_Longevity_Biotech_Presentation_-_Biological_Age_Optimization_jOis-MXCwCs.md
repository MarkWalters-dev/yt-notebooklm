# 2022-01-11 On Deck Longevity Biotech Presentation - Biological Age Optimization

## Executive Summary

*   A blood-based biological age calculator using nine biomarkers and chronological age demonstrates strong linearity with chronological age, with correlations of 0.94 and 0.96 in large US cohorts (NHANES III and IV).
*   This blood-based biological age is strongly associated with all-cause mortality risk, with a 9% increase in mortality risk for every one-year increase in biological age.
*   The performance of this blood-based biological age tool is comparable to top epigenetic clocks, such as the Horvath clock, in terms of correlation with chronological age.
*   Two distinct biological age calculation tools, Levine's PhenoAge and aging.ai, have shown consistent results and associations with mortality risk, suggesting their utility in tracking and potentially influencing biological aging.
*   Personalized dietary interventions, focusing on carotenoid-rich foods, compounds that inhibit CD38 activity, and spermidine sources, along with cardiovascular fitness, can influence biological age markers and potentially improve healthspan.

## Biological Age Calculators and Validation

### Levine's PhenoAge (Blood Biomarker-Based)

*   Utilizes nine blood test biomarkers: albumin, creatinine, glucose, etc.
*   Combines these biomarkers with chronological age to calculate biological age (phenotypic age).
*   **Correlation with Chronological Age:**
    *   NHANES III: 0.94
    *   NHANES IV: 0.96
    *   These correlations are near-perfect linearity, indicating strong agreement with chronological age.
*   **Association with All-Cause Mortality Risk:**
    *   For every one-year increase in biological age, all-cause mortality risk increases by 9%.
    *   This association holds across different age groups:
        *   Young adults: 13% increase per year of biological age.
        *   Middle-aged adults: 10% increase per year of biological age.
        *   Older adults: 8% increase per year of biological age.
*   **Disease-Specific Mortality Associations:** Increased risk observed for deaths from:
    *   Heart disease
    *   Cancer
    *   Lower respiratory disease
    *   Diabetes
    *   Influenza or pneumonia
*   **COVID-19 Mortality:** Older biological age (2006-2010) was associated with increased mortality risk in COVID-19 patients.
*   **Kidney-Related Issues:** Older biological age is associated with an increased risk of death from kidney-related issues (nephritis and nephrosis).

### Comparison with Epigenetic Clocks

*   **Horvath Clock (Epigenetic):** A multi-tissue clock (15 cell types) shows a correlation of 0.94 with chronological age.
*   **Levine's PhenoAge (Blood Biomarker):** Shows a correlation of approximately 0.94 with chronological age, demonstrating comparable accuracy to the Horvath epigenetic clock.

### Aging.ai (Biomarker-Based, Independent of Chronological Age)

*   Includes 19 biomarkers typically found on a standard chemistry panel and complete blood count (CBC).
*   Does **not** include chronological age in its model, allowing for potentially greater reductions in biological age.
*   **Correlation with Chronological Age:** 0.80. While strong, it is less correlated than Levine's PhenoAge.
*   **Association with All-Cause Mortality Risk:**
    *   Biological ages significantly older than chronological age are associated with significantly increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   Biological ages significantly younger than chronological age are associated with significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk.
    *   These findings are consistent across Canadian and US cohorts (NHANES).

## Personal Data and Optimization Strategies

### Personal Biological Age Trajectories

*   **Levine's PhenoAge:**
    *   Multiple tests since 2018.
    *   Average biological age in 2021: 35.6 years.
    *   Average biological age in 2020: 35.6 years.
    *   Average biological age from 2018-2019 (12 tests): 36.1 years.
    *   **Conclusion:** Biological age has been relatively stable or potentially flattened/reduced over a 2-4 year period.
*   **Aging.ai:**
    *   Tests from 2009-2013 (before strict diet tracking): Average biological age 32 years.
    *   Tests from 2016 onwards (with diet tracking):
        *   2016: Average 28 years.
        *   2017: Average 29.3 years.
        *   2018: Average 29.5 years.
        *   2019: Average 30.3 years.
        *   2020: Average 31.3 years.
        *   2021: Average 29.8 years.
    *   **Conclusion:** Consistently around 15-20 years younger than chronological age since implementing strict diet tracking. Trend shows improvement from 2016, a slight increase from 2016-2020, and then a decrease in 2021.

### Dietary Optimization Strategies

*   **Methodology:**
    *   Weighing all food with a food scale.
    *   Tracking intake in Cronometer (macros and micronutrients).
    *   Inputting data into a spreadsheet to analyze correlations with blood biomarkers and fitness metrics.
    *   Implementing interventions based on identified correlations.
*   **Key Food Components and Rationale:**
    *   **Carotenoid-Rich Foods (e.g., watermelon, tomatoes, carrots, spinach, red bell peppers):** Higher blood carotenoid levels are correlated with younger epigenetic age (GRIM age).
    *   **Fisetin-Rich Foods (e.g., strawberries):** Fisetin extends median and maximum lifespan in mice.
    *   **Dietary CD38 Inhibitors (e.g., apigenin in parsley, curcumin in blackberries):** CD38 activity degrades NAD+, a crucial metabolite. Inhibiting CD38 may help maintain NAD+ levels.
    *   **Spermidine-Rich Foods (e.g., mushrooms):** Spermidine extends lifespan in mice and is associated with lower all-cause mortality risk in humans.
    *   **Ergothioneine-Rich Foods (e.g., mushrooms):** Ergothioneine has shown to extend lifespan in flies.
    *   **Whole Grains (corn, oats, barley):** Increased intake correlated with improved glucose levels.
    *   **High Fiber Intake (average 86g/day):** Significantly correlated with lower blood glucose and optimized gut microbiome.
*   **Macronutrient Correlations with Glucose:**
    *   **Calorie Intake:** Not significantly correlated.
    *   **Fat Intake:** Higher average daily fat intake is significantly correlated with higher glucose.
    *   **Carbohydrate Intake:** Higher average daily carbohydrate intake is significantly correlated with lower glucose (likely due to high fiber from fruits/vegetables).
    *   **Protein Intake:** Higher average daily protein intake is significantly correlated with higher glucose.
*   **Fat Intake Analysis:**
    *   Fat intake has been increasing since 2015, mirroring glucose trends.
    *   Reducing total fat intake in the latest blood test corresponded with a drop in blood glucose.
    *   A higher average daily fat intake is significantly correlated with seven "big picture" biomarkers going in the wrong direction (e.g., glucose, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, platelets).
    *   One biomarker showing improvement with higher fat intake: lower MCV (mean corpuscular volume).
    *   Debatable biomarkers: AST, LDL, Red Blood Cells, where the optimal direction is less clear or context-dependent.
    *   **Conclusion:** A higher average daily fat intake is significantly correlated with more biomarkers moving in the wrong direction, leading to a reduction in fat intake for the latest blood test.
*   **Detailed Diet Composition (for last blood test):**
    *   ~2400 calories.
    *   High fiber intake (86g/day), ~3x RDA.
    *   Controlled total fructose intake.
    *   Abundant carotenoids and high vitamin C, K, and selenium intake.
*   **Splurge Period:** Limited intake of less healthy foods (e.g., Nutella, peanut butter) to the days immediately before and after blood draws.

### Supplements and Cardiovascular Fitness

*   **Supplements:**
    *   Prescribed levothyroxine (hypothyroidism).
    *   Methyl B12 (1000 mcg every three days).
    *   Vitamin D (in winter).
    *   No NMN, rapamycin, or metformin.
*   **Cardiovascular Fitness Metrics:**
    *   **Body Weight:** 155 lbs (70 kg).
    *   **Resting Heart Rate:** 47 bpm.
        *   Expected resting heart rate for chronological age: ~56 bpm.
        *   Lower resting heart rate is associated with lower all-cause mortality risk (meta-analysis of 1.2M+ subjects).
        *   Note: Data suggests resting heart rate may increase with age up to ~50, then decrease.
    *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** ~50.3 ms (average daily).
        *   HRV declines significantly during aging.
        *   The personal HRV is higher than the median for chronological age and at the lower end of the range for a 25-year-old.
        *   **Interpretation:** Low resting heart rate in conjunction with high HRV suggests good cardiovascular fitness, indicative of youthfulness rather than age-related decline.
*   **Long-Term Fitness Tracking (since 2018):**
    *   **Resting Heart Rate:** Progressively reduced from ~51 bpm in 2018 to ~47 bpm in 2021, with statistically significant annual reductions. This resists age-related increases.
    *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** Progressively increased from ~47 ms in 2018 to ~58 ms in 2020, with a slight dip to ~52 ms in 2021. These increases are statistically significant compared to 2018.
    *   **Conclusion:** Improvements in cardiovascular fitness are evident since 2018, with resting heart rate declining and HRV increasing. The dip in 2021 indicates room for further optimization.

## Future Directions and Considerations

*   **Epigenetic Data Integration:** Collection of methylation data from multiple epigenetic clocks to correlate with blood biomarkers, diet, and other factors.
*   **Personalized Interventions:** Emphasis on using individual data to guide interventions rather than solely relying on population-level studies or anecdotal evidence.
*   **Development of Tools:** Potential for developing easier-to-use platforms or services for individuals to track and analyze their biological age and related biomarkers.
*   **Functional Measures:** Tracking physical function (strength, flexibility, mobility, balance) and cognitive function alongside biological age markers.
*   **Sleep Optimization:** Time-restricted eating (eating window ending by 3 PM) is primarily used to improve sleep quality by allowing adequate digestion time before bed.
*   **Openness to Interventions:** Willingness to consider interventions like metformin or rapamycin if data suggests a targeted need or if diet and exercise alone are insufficient, but with a strong emphasis on rigorous personal data analysis to assess efficacy and safety.
