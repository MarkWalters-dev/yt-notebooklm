# 2020-07-05 Vitamin K1 phylloquinone - How much is optimal for health

## Executive Summary
* Current adequate intake levels for Vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) in adults may not be optimal for health.
* Higher Vitamin K1 intake (e.g., 626 micrograms/day) is associated with approximately half the risk of all-cause mortality compared to lower intakes.
* Maximizing gamma-glutamyl carboxylase activity, indicated by reduced undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels, appears to require at least 1000 micrograms of Vitamin K1 per day.
* Supplementation or dietary intake of 1000 micrograms of Vitamin K1 per day has been linked to reduced age-related bone mineral density loss, improved insulin sensitivity, and reduced age-related decline in aortic elasticity.
* Raw fresh parsley is a highly efficient source of Vitamin K1, requiring only 61 grams to obtain 1000 micrograms.

## Introduction
This note explores data regarding the optimal daily intake of Vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) for adult health, moving beyond established adequate intake (AI) values.

## All-Cause Mortality Data
* **Current Adequate Intake (AI):**
    * Males (19+ years): 120 micrograms/day
    * Females (19+ years): 90 micrograms/day
* **Observational Findings on All-Cause Mortality Incidence:**
    * Consuming 171 micrograms/day was associated with the highest incidence of all-cause mortality.
    * Similar incidences of all-cause mortality were observed for intakes of 276 and 350 micrograms/day compared to 171 micrograms/day.
    * A separate study found no difference in all-cause mortality risk when comparing 88 micrograms/day with 251 micrograms/day.
    * Intakes significantly greater than 350 micrograms/day may be important for reducing all-cause mortality.
    * An intake of 626 micrograms/day was associated with approximately half the risk of death from all causes when compared with lesser intakes.

## Vitamin K1 and Gamma-Glutamyl Carboxylase Activity
Gamma-glutamyl carboxylase is a crucial enzyme that requires Vitamin K1 as a cofactor. Its function is to carboxylate proteins, converting undercarboxylated forms into their active, carboxylated counterparts.

**Process Visualization:**

Vitamin K1 + CO₂ + O₂ + Undercarboxylated Protein  ->  Gamma-Glutamyl Carboxylase  ->  Carboxylated Protein + H₂O

* **Impact of Vitamin K1 Sufficiency:**
    * Sufficient Vitamin K1 leads to maximal gamma-glutamyl carboxylase activity.
    * This results in increased levels of carboxylated proteins (e.g., carboxylated osteocalcin) and decreased levels of undercarboxylated proteins (e.g., undercarboxylated osteocalcin).

* **Effect of Vitamin K1 Intake on Undercarboxylated Osteocalcin (UCOC):**
    * **Placebo:** Approximately 7% UCOC.
    * **250 micrograms/day Vitamin K1:** No significant reduction in UCOC.
    * **500 micrograms/day Vitamin K1:** Reduced UCOC to approximately 2%.
    * **1000 micrograms/day Vitamin K1:** Maximally reduced UCOC levels.
    * **2000 micrograms/day Vitamin K1:** Also maximally reduced UCOC levels.

* **Optimal Intake for Maximizing Gamma-Glutamyl Carboxylase Activity:** Based on UCOC data, at least 1000 micrograms/day of Vitamin K1 may be optimal.

## Human Evidence Supporting Higher Vitamin K1 Intake
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) administering 1000 micrograms of Vitamin K1 per day have shown:
* Reduced levels of undercarboxylated osteocalcin.
* Reduced age-related loss of bone mineral density.
* Improved insulin sensitivity.
* Reduced age-related decline in aortic elasticity (in a study that did not directly measure UCOC levels).

## Dietary Sources of Vitamin K1 (Sorted by Efficiency for 1000 micrograms Intake)
* **Raw Fresh Parsley:** 61 grams (22 calories)
* *(Other sources are not detailed in the transcript beyond mentioning they exist)*

## Personal Vitamin K1 Intake Example
* The speaker's average daily intake over two years (July 2018 - July 2020) was 1486 micrograms/day.
* This intake is well above the 1000 micrograms/day threshold for maximizing gamma-glutamyl carboxylase activity and associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk.
