# 2024-09-25 Diet Supplements That Correspond To A 13y Younger Biological Age Blood Test 6 In 2024

## Executive Summary

*   The individual's biological age, as measured by the PhenoAge calculator, was 13 years younger than their chronological age for blood test #6.
*   Key dietary and supplement interventions were explored, including the reduction of fructose intake, supplementation with Vitamin D and Nicotinic Acid, and specific dietary compositions.
*   A significant reduction in fructose intake (from 57g to 48g per day) was implemented to test its correlation with 6 age-associated biomarkers.
*   The diet for this period was characterized by a high intake of whole foods, with 98% of total calories derived from clean sources.
*   Micronutrient intake was significantly higher than recommended daily allowances for several vitamins and minerals, including Vitamin K (20x RDA) and Niacin (5x RDA).

## Prescription Medications

*   **Levothyroxine:** 137.5 micrograms per day. This medication has been taken daily since the individual's early twenties for hypothyroidism.

## Supplements

The following supplements were taken during the 42-day period preceding blood test #6:

*   **Vitamin D:**
    *   1000 IU for 25 days.
    *   2000 IU for 3 days.
    *   *Rationale:* To address insufficient sun exposure in Boston for 8-9 months of the year and to test its inverse correlation with nighttime respiratory rate (a marker of immune activation).
*   **Nicotinic Acid (Niacin):**
    *   50-60 milligrams per day for 28 days.
    *   *Rationale:* To increase NAD levels. This was chosen over NMN due to its lower cost and comparable efficacy at lower doses.
*   **Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN):**
    *   800-1000 milligrams per day for 3 days.
    *   *Rationale:* Experimentation to subjectively assess differences compared to low-dose nicotinic acid. No subjective difference was noted, leading to a preference for nicotinic acid.

*Note: No other geroprotectors or senolytics were taken during this specific test period. Rapamycin was started after this test period and will be included in future analyses.*

## Diet

The 42-day period for this test corresponds to the time between July 26th and September 5th, 2024. All food intake was weighed daily.

### Diet Composition (Top Foods by Grams)

The following list is ranked in grams from highest to lowest, with exceptions for coffee, green tea, and pizza:

1.  **Sardines**
2.  **Strawberries**
3.  **Beets**
4.  **Oats (Steel Cut)**
5.  **Parsley**
6.  **Watermelon**
7.  **Almonds**
8.  **Tomatoes**
9.  **Coffee** (1 x 20oz black coffee per day)
10. **Green Tea** (20 oz per day, loose leaf organic Japanese)

*Excluded from ranking (ranked by calories):*
*   **Pizza** (1 slice of Costco pizza)

### Dietary Experiments and Changes

*   **Fructose Reduction:**
    *   *Previous intake:* 57 grams per day.
    *   *Current intake:* 48 grams per day (lowest recorded over 50+ tests).
    *   *Rationale:* To test the correlation between higher fructose intake and a negative direction of 6 key biomarkers related to aging and all-cause mortality risk.
    *   *Specific Food Reductions:*
        *   Strawberries: Reduced from ~500g to 320g per day.
        *   Beets: Reduced from ~300g to 127g per day.
        *   Watermelon: Reduced from ~210g to 170g per day.
*   **Parsley Reduction:**
    *   *Previous intake:* ~62g per day.
    *   *Current intake:* ~24g per day.
    *   *Rationale:* Reduced in conjunction with smoothie and beet intake, for its Apigenin content, aiming to inhibit CD38 and maintain NAD levels.
*   **Oats Increase:**
    *   *Previous intake:* ~1g per day.
    *   *Current intake:* 53g per day (steel cut oats).
    *   *Rationale:* To increase whole grain intake as an alternative to fruit due to the fructose experiment. Chosen over barley to avoid increasing nicotinamide.
*   **Mushroom Intake:** Kept relatively low to test the hypothesis that high nicotinamide from mushrooms might increase homocysteine. Homocysteine did increase slightly, suggesting nicotinamide may not be the sole factor.
*   **Brazil Nut Intake:** Reduced by half, as higher selenium intake did not impact free T3/free T4 ratio or other biomarkers.

### Cheat Meals / Days

*   **Pizza:** 1 slice of Costco pizza.
*   **Homemade Reese's Peanut Butter Cups:** Chocolate mixed with peanut butter (1 day).
*   **Peanut Butter and Jelly:** Peanut butter mixed with jelly (1 day).
*   **Total Junk Calories:** Approximately 1600 calories.
*   **Percentage of Total Calories:** 1.8% of total calories, indicating a 98% clean diet.

### Macronutrient Breakdown (Average Daily Intake)

*   **Total Calories:** 2145 kcal (close to the lowest intake since 2021).
*   **Protein:**
    *   100 grams per day.
    *   ~1.6 g/kg body weight (body weight ~64 kg / 141 lbs).
    *   ~19% of total calories.
*   **Fat:**
    *   82 grams per day.
    *   34% of total calories.
    *   *Saturated Fat Experiment:* Saturated fat intake from coconut butter was kept low for two tests to examine its correlation with older Horvath epigenetic age and shorter telomere length. Data for repeatability is pending.
    *   Omega-3 and Omega-6 levels were similar to the previous test.
    *   Monounsaturated fat was slightly higher (+2g) than the previous test.
*   **Carbohydrates:**
    *   Total Carbs: 291 grams per day.
    *   Fiber: 84 grams per day.
    *   Net Carbs: 207 grams per day (39% of total calories).
    *   *Fiber Fermentation:* ~8% of total calories (180 kcal) from short-chain fatty acids.
    *   **Net Macronutrient Breakdown:**
        *   Fat: ~43% (34% + 8% from fiber fermentation).
        *   Net Carbs: ~39%.
        *   Protein: ~19%.
*   **Fructose:** 48 grams per day (new record low over 50+ tests).

### Micronutrient Intake

*   The individual aimed to meet or exceed the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for all vitamins and minerals.
*   Intentional supplementation beyond RDA was based on correlations with biomarkers (data available on Patreon).
*   **Examples of High Micronutrient Intake:**
    *   **Vitamin K:** ~20x RDA.
    *   **Niacin:** ~5x RDA.
    *   **Carotenoids (Alpha and Beta Carotene, Beta Cryptoxanthin):** Significantly higher than recommended intake.

## Experiments

### Fructose Intake Reduction

*   **Objective:** To test the correlation between higher fructose intake and a negative direction of 6 key biomarkers related to aging and all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Method:** Reduced daily fructose intake from 57g to 48g by decreasing intake of strawberries, beets, and watermelon.
*   **Outcome:** While a 13-year younger biological age was observed, it was noted as the "worst data of the year," leading to speculation that the fructose reduction (or associated dietary changes like increased oats, decreased beets/parsley) may not have been optimal for all biomarkers. Fructose intake will be increased in subsequent tests to re-evaluate.

### Mushroom Intake and Homocysteine

*   **Hypothesis:** High nicotinamide intake from mushrooms could be increasing homocysteine levels.
*   **Method:** Kept mushroom intake low for this test period.
*   **Outcome:** Homocysteine levels increased slightly, suggesting that nicotinamide from mushrooms might not be the primary driver of elevated homocysteine. A higher protein intake is being considered as a potential factor.

### Saturated Fat from Coconut Butter

*   **Hypothesis:** Saturated fatty acids from coconut butter are significantly correlated with an older Horvath epigenetic age and shorter telomere length.
*   **Method:** Saturated fat intake from coconut butter was reduced for two consecutive tests.
*   **Outcome:** Data is still being gathered to determine repeatability and impact on Horvath and telomere length. Saturated fat intake will be increased for future tests to further investigate.

## Future Plans

*   **Test #7:** Increase protein intake by 10-15 grams per day, maintain total calorie intake around 2150 kcal, and increase fructose intake towards 57g or higher.
*   Continue to monitor the impact of Rapamycin on Candida antibody levels (results expected within a week and will be posted on Patreon).
*   Further investigation into the correlation between higher protein intake and homocysteine levels.
*   Re-evaluate the diet composition, potentially shifting back towards higher fat, more nuts/seeds, and less whole grains to aim for a 15-16 year biological age reduction.
