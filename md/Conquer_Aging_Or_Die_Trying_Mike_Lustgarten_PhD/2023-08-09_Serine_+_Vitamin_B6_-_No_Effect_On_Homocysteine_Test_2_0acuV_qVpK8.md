# 2023-08-09 Serine + Vitamin B6 - No Effect On Homocysteine Test 2

## Executive Summary

*   Serine and Vitamin B6 were hypothesized to reduce homocysteine by converting it into cystathionine and then cystine, a precursor to glutathione (GSH), which is linked to improved health outcomes and extended lifespan in mice.
*   Despite the speaker's personal supplementation with increasing doses of serine (from 2g to 4g per day) and Vitamin B6 (from 3mg to approximately 36mg per day) over several months, homocysteine levels did not decrease and instead returned to the baseline of 11.1 micromolar.
*   A study in young adults showed that 300mg of niacinamide (a form of Vitamin B3) significantly increased plasma homocysteine. Although not statistically significant, 300mg of nicotinic acid (the form supplemented by the speaker) also showed a trend towards higher homocysteine, which is relevant given the speaker's 600mg daily dose.
*   Metabolomic data from the speaker's personal tests suggested that some of the supplemented serine might have been converted to cysteine (showing an 80% increase in blood levels) without affecting homocysteine, rather than being primarily directed towards homocysteine reduction or conversion to glycine.
*   A further personal experiment is planned, involving 6g/day of serine, continued Vitamin B6, and complete cessation of nicotinic acid supplementation, to definitively assess the impact of high-dose serine and B6 on homocysteine.

## Background: Homocysteine Metabolism and Longevity

In the context of longevity, previous research suggested that serine plus Vitamin B6 could be an effective way to reduce homocysteine.

**Traditional Homocysteine Conversion Pathways:**
*   **Folic Acid Pathway:** Dietary folic acid is converted into serum folate. In combination with Vitamin B12, serum folate converts homocysteine into methionine.
*   **Betaine Pathway:** Dietary betaine (trimethylglycine) or choline (which is converted into betaine) also converts homocysteine into methionine.

*Note: Decreasing homocysteine to increase methionine might not be ideal for longevity, as methionine restriction has been shown to extend lifespan in animal models. Its effect in humans is currently unknown.*

**Serine + Vitamin B6 Pathway for Homocysteine Reduction:**
*   Adding serine plus Vitamin B6 can convert homocysteine into cystathionine.
*   In the presence of adequate B6, cystathionine is further converted into cystine.
*   Cystine can then be incorporated into glutathione (GSH).
*   Glutathione restoration in older adults has been linked to improved health outcomes and extended lifespan in mice.

## Personal Homocysteine Test Results

The speaker conducted a personal experiment to evaluate the effect of serine and Vitamin B6 supplementation on homocysteine levels over multiple blood tests in 2023.

**Supplementation Protocol and Results:**
*   **March (Test 2):**
    *   No serine supplementation.
    *   Normal dietary intake of Vitamin B6 (3 mg/day).
    *   **Homocysteine: 11.1 micromolar.**
*   **April (Test 3):**
    *   Serine supplementation: ~2 grams/day.
    *   Vitamin B6 intake (through supplementation): 8 mg/day (total 11 mg/day).
    *   **Homocysteine: Decreased (moved in the desired direction).**
*   **July (Test 4):**
    *   Serine supplementation: ~4 grams/day.
    *   Vitamin B6 intake (through supplementation): Tripled again (approximately 36 mg/day, 12x higher than March).
    *   **Homocysteine: Returned to ~11.1 micromolar.**

The results indicated that despite increasing serine and B6, homocysteine did not consistently reduce and reverted to baseline levels.

## Potential Impact of Niacin/Nicotinic Acid on Homocysteine

The speaker initiated niacin (nicotinic acid) supplementation nine days before the July test, which increased NAD levels. This raised the question of whether niacin could have counteracted the intended homocysteine reduction.

**Evidence from a Young Adult Study (N=30, ages 20-23):**
*   **Control (Water):** No increase in plasma homocysteine three hours after consumption.
*   **Niacinamide (300mg):**
    *   Plasma homocysteine significantly increased from approximately 11 to 16 micromolar after 1.5 hours.
    *   Further increased to about 18 micromolar three hours after supplementation.
*   **Nicotinic Acid (300mg):**
    *   Plasma homocysteine showed a non-significant trend towards higher levels after 1.5 hours, which plateaued up to three hours.
*   **Speaker's Personal Dose:** The speaker was taking approximately 600mg/day of nicotinic acid, double the dose used in the study, suggesting a potential for a more pronounced effect.

It is possible that the nicotinic acid supplementation, while raising NAD, may have pushed homocysteine levels higher, thereby negating the effects of serine and B6.

## Alternative Fates of Serine

Besides reacting with homocysteine, serine can be converted into other metabolites.

**Serine Metabolic Pathways (Independent of Homocysteine):**
*   **Serine -> Cysteine:**
    Serine -> (in presence of Acetyl CoA) -> O-acetylserine -> (in presence of H2S / thiosulfate) -> Cysteine
    *(This conversion does not directly affect homocysteine.)*
*   **Serine -> Glycine:**
    Serine -> (in presence of H4 Folate / tetrahydrofolate) -> Glycine
    *(This conversion also does not directly impact homocysteine.)*

## Metabolomic Data Analysis

The speaker reviewed metabolomic data (from iolo tests in April and May, coinciding with 2g and 4g serine supplementation respectively) to investigate the fate of supplemented serine.

**Metabolite Levels (April vs. May):**
*   **Serine:** Despite doubling serine intake from 2g to 4g, blood levels of serine dropped by 70 micromolar (from 170 to 100 micromolar). This suggests serine was being consumed or utilized elsewhere.
*   **Glycine:** Glycine levels remained relatively stable, from 313 to 301 micromolar. There was no expected increase in glycine if serine was significantly converted to it.
*   **Cysteine:** Cysteine levels showed an approximate 80% increase (an 8 micromolar increase from a lower baseline). This suggests that some of the supplemented serine may have been converted to cysteine, as depicted in the metabolic pathway above, without directly reducing homocysteine.

## Future Plan

The speaker plans to conduct one more test to determine if high-dose serine, without the confounding factor of nicotinic acid, can reduce homocysteine.

**Next Supplementation Protocol:**
*   Increase serine intake to 6 grams per day.
*   Continue Vitamin B6 supplementation.
*   Completely discontinue nicotinic acid supplementation.
*   Observe homocysteine levels on the subsequent blood test.

If no reduction in homocysteine is observed with this protocol, serine supplementation for homocysteine reduction will be discontinued from the speaker's approach.
