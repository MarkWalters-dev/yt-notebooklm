# 2022-05-08 Blood Test Analysis - Italian Centenarians

## Executive Summary
*   **Youthful Biomarkers:** Centenarians exhibited highly favorable (youthful) levels of Glucose (at the lowest all-cause mortality risk range) and HDL cholesterol.
*   **Mixed Results:** Triglycerides were relatively healthy (close to lowest mortality risk) and Platelets were at the lowest all-cause mortality risk range, despite being age-inappropriate for women.
*   **Unhealthy Markers (Mortality Risk):** Hemoglobin levels were detrimental for male centenarians (associated with increased mortality risk).
*   **Aged/Unhealthy Markers:** Uric Acid, Albumin, Globulin, Creatinine (low eGFR), and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) were all indicative of advanced age and/or associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.

## Biomarkers Associated with Youth and Low Mortality Risk (Good)

### Glucose
*   **Aging Trend:** Increases with age (youth $\approx 85 \text{ mg/dL}$; 100+ years $\approx 100+ \text{ mg/dL}$).
*   **Centenarian Value:** $84 \text{ mg/dL}$.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** Lowest risk is in the $80 \text{ to } 94 \text{ mg/dL}$ range (J-shaped curve).
*   **Conclusion:** Centenarian glucose levels are youthful and associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk.

### HDL Cholesterol
*   **Aging Trend:** Peaks in the early twenties ($\text{Men} \approx 56$; $\text{Women} \approx 65$) and declines steadily with age.
*   **Centenarian Value:** $57 \text{ mg/dL}$.
*   **Perspective:** For women, this level is expected for someone approaching 60. For men, this is higher than the peak youth value ($\approx 56$).
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** The centenarian value ($57 \text{ mg/dL}$) sits at the bottom of the mortality risk curve.
*   **Conclusion:** HDL levels are youthful and associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk.

### Triglycerides
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** Lowest risk is near $90 \text{ mg/dL}$ ($\approx 1 \text{ mmol/L}$). Risk increases significantly above $3.5 \text{ mmol/L}$.
*   **Centenarian Value:** $106 \text{ mg/dL}$.
*   **Longevity Hallmark:** 11 out of 13 studies on centenarians showed levels less than $110 \text{ mg/dL}$ ($\approx 1.2 \text{ mmol/L}$).
*   **Conclusion:** Levels are relatively healthy and close to the lowest all-cause mortality risk range; relatively low triglycerides may be a hallmark of longevity.

### Red Blood Cells (RBC)
*   **Aging Trend:** Declines with age ($\text{Youth} \approx 4.8 \text{ [Men]} / 4.3 \text{ [Women]} \rightarrow \approx 3.9$ at 95 years).
*   **Centenarian Value:** $4.24$.
*   **Conclusion:** RBC levels are youthful, suggesting an effective age $30 \text{ to } 80$ years younger than chronological age.

### Platelets
*   **Aging Trend:** Platelets decline across the lifespan (e.g., $\text{Women}: 260 \rightarrow 240$ by age 100).
*   **Centenarian Value:** $212$.
*   **Perspective:** This value suggests an age-equivalent platelet count that is 20 years younger than expected for men but older than expected for women.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** Lowest risk is observed in the $200 \text{ to } 300$ range.
*   **Conclusion:** Although chronologically aged, the platelet count is associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk.

## Biomarkers with Mixed or Questionable Results

### Hemoglobin (Hb)
*   **Men Perspective (Reference $14 \text{ to } 14.9$):**
    *   Centenarian Value: $12.53 \text{ g/dL}$.
    *   **Risk:** Levels below $13 \text{ g/dL}$ were significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Women Perspective (Reference $12 \text{ to } 12.9$):**
    *   Centenarian Value: $12.53 \text{ g/dL}$.
    *   **Risk:** Increased risk only occurred below $11 \text{ g/dL}$.
    *   **Conclusion:** Youthful and healthy levels for women (lowest mortality risk), but **unhealthy levels for men** (increased mortality risk).

### AST (Liver Enzyme)
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** A median reference of 20 resulted in $5\%$ reduced risk in the Q3 bracket.
*   **Centenarian Value:** $23.3$.
*   **Conclusion:** AST is considered a "good" finding in this context.

### ALT (Liver Enzyme)
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** The reference median was 15. However, higher quartiles ($18 \text{ to } 22$) were associated with **significantly reduced** risk.
*   **Centenarian Value:** $13.4$.
*   **Conclusion:** The centenarian ALT value suggests a **higher all-cause mortality risk** compared to the optimal range ($18 \text{ to } 22$).

### AST/ALT Ratio
*   **Centenarian Ratio:** $1.745$ (Calculated: $23.3 / 13.4$).
*   **Survival Data:** Low ratios ($\approx 1.02$) showed improved survival compared to high ratios ($\approx 1.83$).
*   **Conclusion:** The ratio (closer to the high range) is trending in the "wrong direction" despite one individual marker (AST) being good.

### Total Cholesterol (TC)
*   **Aging Trend:** Increases until the mid-fifties, then declines. Extrapolation suggests lower levels are expected in centenarians.
*   **Centenarian Value:** $189 \text{ mg/dL}$.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk (Age Group $75 \text{ to } 99$):** The lowest risk was $220 \text{ to } 229 \text{ mg/dL}$.
    *   **Men:** $189 \text{ mg/dL}$ was not significantly associated with increased risk.
    *   **Women:** $189 \text{ mg/dL}$ was associated with a $5\%$ increase in all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Conclusion:** Indeterminate for youthfulness; slightly detrimental for women regarding mortality risk.

### Leukocytes (White Blood Cells - WBC)
*   **Life Expectancy Data:** Longest life expectancy (37 years post-assessment) was in the $3.5 \text{ to } 6$ range. Shorter life spans were seen above 6.
*   **Centenarian Value:** $6.18$.
*   **Conclusion:** The value is just outside the optimal range ($3.5 \text{ to } 6$) but is close to the boundary. Lack of differential data (neutrophils, lymphocytes) limits full contextual assessment.

## Biomarkers Associated with Age or Increased Mortality Risk (Bad)

### Uric Acid (UA)
*   **Aging Trend (Longitudinal Data):** In men, UA increased with age groups cross-sectionally, but longitudinally, UA levels appeared higher in younger cohorts than older ones. In women, UA consistently increases with age after 40.
*   **Centenarian Value (Men/Women):** $333 \text{ micromolar}$ (Lower than most young cohorts).
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** Lowest risk is near $303 \text{ micromolar}$.
*   **Conclusion:** While the levels are indicative of advanced age (lower than young cohorts), they are very close to the lowest all-cause mortality risk point.

### Total Protein
*   **Aging Trend:** Declines with age ($\approx 7.4 \rightarrow 6.6 \text{ to } 6.8$).
*   **Centenarian Value:** $7.11 \text{ g/dL}$.
*   **Perspective:** This value is 35 to 45 years "younger" than expected chronologically. *However, this requires further breakdown.*

#### Albumin (Component of Total Protein)
*   **Aging Trend:** Declines with age (Peak youth $\approx 46 \rightarrow \text{declines}$).
*   **Centenarian Value:** $38.4 \text{ g/L}$.
*   **Perspective:** This is $\approx 8$ years younger than expected based on age decline alone.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** Lowest risk is $46 \text{ g/L}$.
*   **Conclusion:** The centenarian level of $38.4 \text{ g/L}$ shows a **significantly increased all-cause mortality risk**.

#### Globulin (Calculated Component: Total Protein - Albumin)
*   **Centenarian Value (Calculated):** $32.7 \text{ g/L}$ ($71.1 - 38.4$).
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** Lower levels ($< 3.2$) are associated with the longest life expectancy, while higher levels ($> 3.2$) shorten life expectancy.
*   **Conclusion:** The centenarian level ($32.7 \text{ g/L}$ - note: context suggests this might be $3.27 \text{ g/dL}$ or similar high unit based on the comparison graph) places them on the line associated with **increased all-cause mortality risk** compared to those with lower globulin/gamma gap.

### Creatinine and Kidney Function (eGFR)
*   **Aging Trend (Creatinine):** Increases with age.
*   **Centenarian Value (Creatinine):** $1.29$.
*   **Estimated GFR (eGFR):** Calculated eGFR is 37 (Men) / 49 (Women) for a 100-year-old.
*   **eGFR Aging Trend:** Declines from $\approx 125$ in youth to $\approx 50$ near 100 years.
*   **Conclusion:** Centenarians have age-appropriate creatinine levels and relatively low/age-expected levels of eGFR, indicating **declining kidney function**.

### Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)
*   **Aging Trend:** Increases significantly with age (Youth $\approx 11 \text{ to } 13 \rightarrow 100+\text{ years } > 20$).
*   **Centenarian Value:** $2 \text{ mg/dL}$ (This low value appears anomalous or is a typo in the source data, as the subsequent mortality analysis contradicts it heavily).
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk (Based on Mortality Plot):** Lowest risk is at $14.7 \text{ mg/dL}$. Risk increases sharply above this point, especially with increasing age.
*   **Perspective:** The plot suggests the centenarian value (if interpreted as typical for the cohort) would be **way off the chart** (highest shown is $39 \text{ mg/dL}$), leading to significant risk.
*   **Conclusion:** Based on typical aging trends and mortality data, BUN levels are likely **aged and unhealthy**.
