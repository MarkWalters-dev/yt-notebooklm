# 2024-02-14 RDW Is A Significant Predictor Of Biological Age - Which Factors May Optimize It

## Executive Summary

*   Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) is identified as the top contributing biomarker for predicting biological age using Dr. Morgan Levine's PhenoAge calculator.
*   RDW percentage generally increases with age and a higher RDW is associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   Based on a 3.2 million-person study, the optimal RDW percentage range associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk is 11.4% to 12.6%. Both values below 11.4% (rarely observed) and above 13.7% are linked to significantly increased mortality.
*   In one study, a higher Omega-3 Index (EPA and DHA in red blood cell membranes) was associated with a relatively lower RDW, though the reduction was modest and did not bring RDW into the optimal range.
*   Personal data analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between average daily calorie intake and RDW percentage (correlation coefficient +0.68). The inverse correlation between dietary omega-3 intake and RDW (correlation coefficient -0.41) disappeared after adjusting for calorie intake, suggesting calorie intake is a more significant driver of RDW in this individual's data.

## What is Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW)?

The Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) percentage is a measure of the standard deviation of red blood cell volume. It indicates the variability in the size of red blood cells.

**RDW Interpretation:**
*   **Low RDW:** Indicates that red blood cells are relatively uniform in volume.
*   **High RDW:** Indicates a heterogeneous population of red blood cells, with a wide variation in size (some very large, some very small).

## RDW, Aging, and Mortality Risk

RDW percentage typically increases with age, observable across individuals from 20 to 95 years old. This age-related increase is significant because higher RDW levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.

A large study involving 3.2 million people investigated the association between RDW percentage and all-cause mortality risk. Analyzing data adjusted for demographics, morbidities, and other lab values (the fully adjusted model), the findings revealed:

*   **Optimal Range:** The lowest all-cause mortality risk was associated with an RDW percentage between **11.4% and 12.6%**.
*   **Increased Risk (High RDW):** RDW values greater than **13.7%** were significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Increased Risk (Low RDW):** Very low RDW values, less than **11.4%**, were also significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk. However, such low values are exceedingly rare in the general population (occurring in 0.01% to 0.1% of individuals). Given the age-related increase in RDW, higher values are generally more common than extremely low ones.

The goal is to resist any age-related increase in RDW, aiming to maintain levels within the 11.4% to 12.6% optimal range.

## Factors Affecting RDW: Omega-3 Index

The Omega-3 Index measures the proportion of omega-3 fatty acids (specifically EPA and DHA) found in red blood cell membranes.

*   In at least one study, an inverse association was observed: as the Omega-3 Index increased (up to approximately 5%), the RDW percentage showed a slight decline (from ~13.8% to ~13.5%).
*   However, even at higher Omega-3 Indexes (above 9%), the RDW percentage remained around 13.5%, which is still above the optimal range for all-cause mortality (11.4% to 12.6%). This suggests that while omega-3s may have some influence, they might not be sufficient on their own to bring RDW into the ideal range.

## Personal Data: Dietary Omega-3 and Calorie Intake

The speaker conducted a personal analysis to investigate dietary factors correlated with RDW percentage.

### Personal Data Collection Methodology:

*   **Diet Tracking:** Since 2015, all food consumed was weighed using a food scale, logged into Cronometer, and then manually transferred to a spreadsheet.
*   **Blood Tests:** 46 blood tests were performed over this period, with each test corresponding to an average daily dietary intake calculated from the period between the previous and current blood test.
*   **Correlation Analysis:** This extensive dataset allows for the evaluation of correlations between dietary intake and various blood biomarkers, including RDW.

### Findings from Personal Data:

*   **Dietary Omega-3 Intake:** A significant inverse correlation (correlation coefficient: -0.41, p < 0.05) was found between average daily dietary omega-3 intake and RDW percentage. Higher omega-3 intake was associated with lower RDW, and lower omega-3 intake was associated with higher RDW.
*   **Calorie Intake:** A stronger significant positive correlation (correlation coefficient: +0.68, p < 0.05) was observed between average daily calorie intake and RDW percentage. Higher calorie intake was strongly associated with higher RDW, and lower calorie intake was strongly associated with lower RDW.
*   **Multivariate Analysis:** A multivariate linear regression model was used to assess the independent contribution of dietary omega-3 and calorie intake to RDW. After adjusting for calorie intake, the significant correlation between dietary omega-3 intake and RDW percentage was no longer present.

This personal data suggests that, at least for this individual, calorie intake is a more significant driver of RDW percentage than dietary omega-3 intake. Therefore, reducing calorie intake may be a beneficial strategy to optimize RDW.
