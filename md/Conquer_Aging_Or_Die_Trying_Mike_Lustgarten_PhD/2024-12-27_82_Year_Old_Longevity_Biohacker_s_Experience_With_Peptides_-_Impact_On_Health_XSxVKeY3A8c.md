# 2024-12-27 82 Year Old Longevity Biohacker s Experience With Peptides - Impact On Health

## Executive Summary

*   Peptides are chains of fewer than 50 amino acids, while larger chains are classified as proteins.
*   Dr. Vladimir Khavinson, from the Institute of Bioregulation and Gerontology in Saint Petersburg, Russia, developed a suite of short peptides (2-4 amino acids long) for bioregulation and gerontology.
*   Specific Khavinson peptides have demonstrated individual benefits; Bisolutin is associated with improved vision, and Sirlutin is reported to have a profound impact on brain function within days for some individuals.
*   The speaker participates in an ongoing trial to replicate results observed in Russia, following a protocol of taking 5-7 different Khavinson peptides monthly for 3.5 to 4 years.
*   Russian studies on Khavinson peptides indicated that a 3-5 year course of treatment could double or triple the survival rate within a peer group.

## Introduction to Peptides

Amino acids are fundamental to the body. When amino acids are linked together in chains:
*   Less than 50 amino acids: Typically called a **peptide**.
*   Larger numbers of amino acids: Typically called a **protein**.

## Khavinson Peptides for Bioregulation and Gerontology

Dr. Vladimir Khavinson, a research scientist and head of the Institute of Bioregulation and Gerontology in Saint Petersburg, Russia, developed a suite of peptides. These peptides are notably short, consisting of only two, three, or four amino acids.

Examples of Khavinson peptides:
*   **Bisolutin**: Targeted for eye health.
*   **Sirlutin**: Targeted for brain health.

## Personal Protocol and Observed Effects

The speaker is part of an ongoing trial to replicate results from studies conducted in Russia using Khavinson peptides.

**Peptide Intake Protocol:**
*   **Frequency:** A different mix of approximately 5-7 different Khavinson peptides is taken monthly.
*   **Duration per peptide:** Each specific peptide is typically taken for 10 days within the month.
*   **Dosage example (Bisolutin capsule):** Two capsules per day for 10 days.
*   **Current engagement:** The speaker has been following this protocol for about 3.5 to 4 years.
*   **Cost:** The speaker's monthly regimen, involving 5-7 peptides, costs approximately $350.

**Observed Effects:**
*   While difficult to quantify general impact, specific improvements are occasionally noted.
*   **Bisolutin (eye peptide):** When taken, it helps improve vision, allowing the speaker to read a newspaper with less struggle without reading glasses. Bisolutin is available in both capsule form and a sublingual spray.
*   **Sirlutin (brain peptide):** The speaker's wife experienced a profound impact on brain function within a day or two of taking Sirlutin for the first time.
*   **General physiology:** After taking these peptides for three to four years, the speaker believes they have contributed to general physiological improvements.

## Long-Term Survival Data from Russian Studies

Studies conducted in Russia regarding Khavinson peptides indicated a significant impact on longevity. These studies determined that individuals who followed the peptide program for approximately three to five years experienced a survival rate that was double or triple that of their peer group.
