# 2024-12-03 What Time Of Day Is Best For Red Light Therapy Glen Jeffery PhD

## Executive Summary

*   Red light therapy appears to be most effective when administered in the morning.
*   Mitochondrial function exhibits a morning peak, suggesting a greater responsiveness to red light at this time.
*   In the afternoon, mitochondria are engaged in different cellular processes (termed "housework") that are not enhanced by red light.
*   This morning chronobiology is consistent across various species, including flies, mice, bees, and humans.

## Morning Efficacy of Red Light Therapy

Red light therapy's effectiveness is significantly influenced by the time of day it is administered. The natural evolutionary history of organisms indicates a lack of light exposure in the evenings and at night. This inherent biological rhythm suggests that red light therapy is most beneficial when applied in the morning.

### Mitochondrial Function and Chronobiology

*   **Morning Peak:** In the morning, upon waking, blood sugar levels naturally peak, and hormones shift, preparing the body for activity. This period aligns with an increased readiness for energy utilization.
*   **Mitochondrial Activity:** Mitochondrial ATP production begins to rise just before light exposure in the morning. This indicates a pre-programmed shift in mitochondrial behavior in anticipation of the day's activities.
*   **Afternoon Ineffectiveness:** In the afternoon, attempts to improve mitochondrial function with red light are unsuccessful. This is because mitochondria are engaged in other cellular "housework" or repair processes during this time, making them less responsive to external stimulation by red light.

### Cross-Species Consistency

The principle of morning efficacy for red light therapy is observed across a wide range of species, including:

*   Flies
*   Mice (including Little (dwarf) mice)
*   Bees
*   Humans

This suggests a fundamental biological adaptation to diurnal light cycles that dictates optimal timing for interventions like red light therapy.

### Evolutionary Perspective

From an evolutionary standpoint, organisms near the equator, like early humans in Africa, would have experienced sunrise around 7:00 AM. This predictable cue signaled a shift in behavior for mitochondria, preparing them for the active period of the day. Modern lifestyles have disrupted these natural chronobiological rhythms.
