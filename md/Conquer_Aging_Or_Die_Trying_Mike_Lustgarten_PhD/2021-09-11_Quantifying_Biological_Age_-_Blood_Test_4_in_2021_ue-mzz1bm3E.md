# 2021-09-11 Quantifying Biological Age - Blood Test 4 in 2021

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age, calculated using Morgan Levine's phenotypic age calculator and aging.ai, was determined to be approximately 13 to 17 years younger than chronological age.
*   The diet is rich in carotenoids (e.g., carrots, spinach, red bell peppers), Fisetin (strawberries), and CD38 inhibitors (blackberries, parsley), components associated with younger epigenetic age and extended lifespan in research studies.
*   Daily dietary intake features high fiber (~87g/day) for gut microbiome optimization, and elevated levels of beta carotene (~58mg/day), Vitamin C (~600mg/day), Vitamin K (>1000mcg/day), and selenium (~182mcg/day), all linked to improved health biomarkers and reduced mortality risk.
*   Despite favorable improvements in resting heart rate (decreased 1.1 bpm) and heart rate variability (increased 5.5 ms), these changes did not significantly impact the calculated biological age metrics during this 43-day period.
*   Meticulous daily tracking of diet, fitness, and blood biomarkers (32 tests since 2015) is used to identify and optimize dietary components that collectively improve health and longevity markers.

## Biological Age Assessment

Based on the fourth blood test in 2021, biological age was assessed using two freely available calculators:

*   **Morgan Levine's Phenotypic Age Calculator:** Predicted biological age is approximately 13 years younger than chronological age.
*   **Aging.ai:** Predicted biological age is 31 years old, approximately 17 years younger than chronological age.

## Supplement Regimen

The following supplements were taken during the 43-day period between blood tests (July 21 - September 2):

*   **Levothyroxine:** Taken for approximately 20 years following a hypothyroidism diagnosis in the twenties.
*   **Methyl B12:** Taken to help limit homocysteine levels, which tend to increase with aging. (Note: This supplement will be removed for the next blood test to observe its effect on homocysteine levels).

## Fitness Metrics and Impact

During the 43-day dietary period:

*   **Body Weight:** Stable at approximately 156.7 lbs (a tenth heavier than the previous period).
*   **BMI:** Stable at 24.6 (previously 24.5).
*   **Resting Heart Rate (RHR):** Decreased by 1.1 beats per minute. This is considered a favorable change.
*   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** Increased by approximately 5.5 milliseconds. This is considered a favorable change.

**Impact on Biological Age:** The improvements in RHR and HRV did not significantly impact the biological age calculations for either the Levine or aging.ai tests during this period.

## Dietary Tracking Methodology

The following protocol is used for daily dietary tracking:

*   Weigh all food daily using a food scale.
*   Enter food amounts into the online software, Cronometer.
*   Transfer the output data (macro and micronutrients, individual food amounts) into a spreadsheet.
*   Analyze this data in conjunction with fitness metrics and 32 blood biomarkers collected since 2015 to investigate optimal approaches for health, disease risk reduction, and longevity.

## Key Dietary Components and Rationale

The average daily dietary intake for the 43-day period was meticulously tracked. The diet is characterized by specific food choices with evidence-based health benefits:

### Carotenoid-Rich Foods

Carrots are the top food by weight. Other prominent carotenoid-rich foods include spinach, red bell peppers, watermelon, avocado, and tomato.

**Rationale:** Studies involving approximately 2,300 people show that relatively higher blood levels of carotenoids are associated with a younger epigenetic age (DNA Grim Age). This correlation holds for total carotenoids and individual carotenoids such as lycopene, alpha and beta carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin, and beta cryptoxanthin.

**Dietary Coverage for Specific Carotenoids:**

*   **Lycopene:** Watermelon and tomatoes.
*   **Alpha and Beta Carotene:** Spinach and carrots.
*   **Lutein and Zeaxanthin:** Spinach.
*   **Beta Cryptoxanthin:** Red bell peppers.

### Fisetin Sources

Strawberries are the second most prominent food by weight.

**Rationale:** Fisetin, found in strawberries, has been shown to extend both average and maximum lifespan in mice.

### Dietary CD38 Inhibitors

Blackberries and fresh parsley (average 47 grams/day) are prominent in the diet.

**Rationale:** These foods contain CD38 inhibitors. Curaminin is found in blackberries, and apigenin is found in parsley. The biological process targeted is as follows:

NAD levels decline during aging
-> CD38 levels increase
-> CD38 acts as an NADase (NAD degrading protein)
-> CD38 inhibitors (Apigenin, Curaminin) inhibit CD38
-> Expected outcome: Increased NAD levels or slowed age-related NAD decline.

While NAD levels have not been directly measured, including these inhibitors is considered a prudent strategy to support NAD health.

### "Celebratory" Foods

Cheesecake and M&Ms were consumed as part of a single "celebratory meal" after a blood test, once during the 43-day period. This approach limits processed food intake to a maximum of once per dietary period.

## Diet Composition and Micronutrient Intake

The average daily intake for the 43-day period was approximately 2,500 calories.

**Macronutrient Composition:**

*   **Carbohydrates:** 41%
*   **Fats:** ~42%
*   **Protein:** 17%

**Key Micronutrient and Dietary Targets:**

*   **Fiber:** Approximately 87 grams per day. This high intake is purposely maintained to optimize the gut microbiome.
*   **Total Fructose:** Approximately 75 grams per day (including fructose from fruit and sucrose). While on the lower end of a personal range, intake is monitored due to observed correlations with lower LDL values (potentially below optimal levels for maximally reduced all-cause mortality risk, which is around 50 or higher).
*   **Omega-6 Intake:** Higher levels of dietary omega-6 (primarily from walnuts and pecans, not oils) have been correlated with higher homocysteine levels. The goal is to reduce intake to less than 10 grams per day (aiming for 7-8 grams/day) in the next dietary period, in conjunction with the removal of the Methyl B12 supplement, to observe its impact on homocysteine.
*   **Beta Carotene:** Approximately 58,000 micrograms (58 mg) per day. Relatively higher levels of beta carotene are associated with higher albumin, a marker of youth and reduced all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Vitamin C:** Approximately 600 mg per day, which is about six times the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA). A meta-analysis suggests a dose-response for higher blood levels of vitamin C with reduced all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Vitamin K:** Intake is approximately 19 times higher than the Adequate Intake (AI) of ~100-120 micrograms per day, exceeding 1,000 micrograms per day. This is sourced from green leafy vegetables like spinach, based on data suggesting optimal benefits at higher intakes.
*   **Selenium:** Approximately 182 micrograms per day. This falls within the potentially optimal range of up to 200 micrograms per day.

By tracking diet in conjunction with blood biomarkers, the aim is to identify the diet composition and macro/micronutrient amounts that best optimize the composite of blood biomarkers, thereby maximizing health and potentially longevity.
