# 2022-08-14 Fasting Without Calorie Restriction Extends Lifespan

**Executive Summary**
*   Daily single-meal feeding (intermittent fasting) in male mice significantly extended lifespan compared to ad libitum feeding, even when calorie intake was similar.
*   This lifespan extension was observed across two distinct diets: the National Institute of Aging (NIA) diet (lower sugar) and the Wisconsin (WIS) diet (high sugar).
*   On the NIA diet, single-meal feeding (with a mild ~6% calorie reduction and 9-hour fast) increased median lifespan by 18.5%.
*   On the WIS diet, single-meal feeding (with calorie intake indistinguishable from ad libitum and a 12-hour fast) increased median lifespan by 7%.
*   Combining single-meal feeding with 30% calorie restriction and longer daily fasting periods (19-23 hours) resulted in the greatest lifespan extension.

## Mouse Data: Fasting & Lifespan on NIA Diet

**Study Design:**
*   **Participants:** Male mice (N=45 per group).
*   **Diet:** National Institute of Aging (NIA) Diet, composed of 19% protein, 10% fat, and 12% sucrose.
*   **Feeding Regimens:**
    *   **Ad Libitum (Ad Lib):** Mice had free access to food all day and were not calorie restricted.
    *   **Single Meal Feeding (MF):** Mice were fed once daily and were not intended to be calorie restricted.
    *   **30% Calorie Restriction (30% CR):** Mice were fed once daily and subjected to a 30% calorie restriction.

**Lifespan Analysis (NIA Diet):**
*   **Ad Lib Group:** Had a median survival of approximately 104 weeks.
*   **Single Meal Feeding (MF) Group:**
    *   Showed an 18.5% increase in median lifespan when compared with the Ad Lib group. This was a statistically significant increase.
    *   Also demonstrated a significant increase in 75% survival (the point at which 75% of the colony had died).
*   **30% Calorie Restriction (CR) Group:**
    *   Exhibited a 35% increase in median survival compared to Ad Lib.
    *   Also showed a significant increase in 75% survival.

**Calorie Intake & Fasting (NIA Diet):**
*   **Ad Lib Group:** Consumed an average of 14 kilocalories (kcal) per day per mouse.
*   **Single Meal Feeding (MF) Group:**
    *   Consumed an average of 13.2 kcal per day per mouse, indicating a possible mild ~6% calorie restriction compared to Ad Lib intake.
    *   Ate all of their food within 15 hours, resulting in a 9-hour daily fast.
*   **30% Calorie Restriction (CR) Group:**
    *   Consumed 9.5 kcal per day per mouse, corresponding to a 32% calorie restriction.
    *   Ate all of their food within 5 hours, resulting in a 19-hour daily fast.

**Summary of NIA Diet Findings:**
For the majority of the lifespan, survival was increased for the single meal feeding group, even with only a minor caloric reduction and a 9-hour daily fast. Combining single meal feeding with 30% calorie restriction and a longer 19-hour fast resulted in a greater lifespan extension.

## Mouse Data: Fasting & Lifespan on Wisconsin (WIS) Diet

**Diet Composition Comparison (WIS vs. NIA):**
*   **Wisconsin (WIS) Diet:** Composed of 13% protein, 24% fat, and 46% simple sugars (sucrose).
*   **NIA Diet:** Composed of 19% protein, 10% fat, and 12% sucrose.
*   The WIS diet had a significantly higher sugar and fat content but lower protein compared to the NIA diet.

**Study Design (WIS Diet):**
*   **Participants:** Male mice (N > 140 total across three groups), making this a very large study.
*   **Feeding Regimens:**
    *   **Ad Libitum (Ad Lib):** Free access to food all day and not intended to be calorie restricted.
    *   **Single Meal Feeding (MF):** Fed once daily and not intended to be calorie restricted.
    *   **30% Calorie Restriction (30% CR):** Fed once daily and subjected to a 30% calorie restriction.

**Lifespan Analysis (WIS Diet):**
*   **Ad Lib Group:** Had a median survival of approximately 108 weeks.
*   **Single Meal Feeding (MF) Group:**
    *   Showed a 7% increased median lifespan when compared with Ad Lib.
    *   Demonstrated a significant increase in 75% survival.
*   **30% Calorie Restriction (CR) Group:**
    *   Exhibited a significantly increased median survival (about 137 weeks) compared to Ad Lib.
    *   Also showed a significant increase in 75% survival.

**Calorie Intake & Fasting (WIS Diet):**
*   **Ad Lib Group:** Consumed an average of 13.1 kcal per day per mouse.
*   **Single Meal Feeding (MF) Group:**
    *   Consumed an average of 12.9 kcal per day per mouse, which was considered indistinguishable from the Ad Lib group's intake.
    *   Ate all of their food within 12 hours, resulting in a 12-hour daily fast.
*   **30% Calorie Restriction (CR) Group:**
    *   Consumed 9.2 kcal per day per mouse, corresponding to a 29.8% calorie restriction.
    *   Ate all of their food within 1 hour, resulting in a 23-hour daily fast.

**Summary of WIS Diet Findings:**
On the high-sugar WIS diet, single meal feeding, with calorie intake similar to ad libitum and a 12-hour daily fast, still significantly extended lifespan. The greatest lifespan extension was observed with single meal feeding plus calorie restriction and a 23-hour fast.

## Pooled Data: Overall Impact of Fasting on Lifespan

**Combined Study Data:**
To visualize the overall impact, data from both the NIA and WIS diet studies were pooled and averaged. The three groups were:
*   **Ad Libitum (Ad Lib):** Combined control groups.
*   **Single Meal Feeding (MF):** Combined single meal feeding groups that were not intended to be calorie restricted.
*   **30% Calorie Restriction (30% CR):** Combined 30% calorie restricted groups with single meal feeding.

**Pooled Lifespan Analysis:**
*   **Single Meal Feeding (MF) Group:** The pooled data showed significant increases for both median (50%) and 75% survival compared to the Ad Lib group. The average fasting time for this group across both studies was approximately 11 hours per day. This suggests that prolonged fasting without calorie restriction extends lifespan.
*   **30% Calorie Restriction (CR) Group:** This group demonstrated the largest lifespan-extending effect, with significant increases in both median (50%) and 75% survival. This group maintained an even longer average fasting window of about 21 hours per day.

**Overall Conclusion:**
*   **Ad Libitum Feeding:** Mice with free access to food had the shortest lifespan.
*   **Single Meal Feeding (MF):** Mice that ate all their food within an average of 13 hours and fasted for 11 hours experienced a significant increase in lifespan compared to Ad Lib.
*   **Calorie Restriction (CR) + Single Meal Feeding:** Mice under 30% calorie restriction who ate all their food within an average of 3 hours and fasted for 21 hours achieved the longest lifespan extension.
