# 2025-09-28 Phosphatidylcholines Are Biomarkers Of The Omega-3 Index

## Executive Summary

*   Phosphatidylcholines (PCs), specifically PC 36:5 and PC 38:6, are significant plasma biomarkers that strongly correlate with the Omega-3 Index.
*   Plasma levels of PC 36:5 and PC 38:6 exceeding 60 micromolar are associated with an Omega-3 Index greater than 8%, indicating a lower risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes.
*   While sardine intake is a primary source of EPA and DHA, personal data suggests it is not significantly correlated with PC 36:5 and PC 38:6 levels.
*   Intake of cloves, corn, and bananas showed a positive correlation with higher levels of PC 36:5 and PC 38:6, while tomato and egg intake showed a negative correlation.
*   Personal data indicates a downward trend in PC 36:5 and PC 38:6 levels over three years, despite consistently remaining above the optimal 60 micromolar threshold.

## Introduction to the Omega-3 Index and Biomarkers

The Omega-3 Index measures the percentage of EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) in red blood cell membranes. It is associated with cardiovascular disease outcomes:

*   **< 4% Omega-3 Index:** High risk for CVD-related outcomes.
*   **> 8% Omega-3 Index:** Lower risk for CVD-related outcomes.

This note focuses on **biomarkers** of the Omega-3 Index, specifically phosphatidylcholines, which can be measured in plasma to evaluate Omega-3 Index status without directly measuring red blood cell membranes.

## Phosphatidylcholines: Structure and Composition

Phosphatidylcholines (PCs) are structurally similar to di- and triglycerides, featuring a glycerol backbone.

*   **Glycerol Backbone:**
    *   Two fatty acids attached at two positions.
    *   A phosphocholine head group attached at the third position.

**Specific Phosphatidylcholines as Biomarkers:**

*   **PC 36:5:**
    *   Glycerol backbone.
    *   Fatty acid in the first position: 16:0 (palmitate, saturated).
    *   Fatty acid in the second position: 20:5 (EPA).
    *   Phosphocholine head group.
    *   *Contains EPA.*

*   **PC 38:6:**
    *   Glycerol backbone.
    *   Fatty acid in the first position: 16:0 (palmitate, saturated).
    *   Fatty acid in the second position: 22:6 (DHA).
    *   Phosphocholine head group.
    *   *Contains DHA.*

## Correlation Between Phosphatidylcholines and Omega-3 Index

A study demonstrated a strong and significant correlation (correlation coefficient > 0.7, P < 0.05) between the sum of plasma levels of PC 36:5 and PC 38:6 and the Omega-3 Index.

## Optimal Levels for Phosphatidylcholines and Cardiovascular Health

Based on data extrapolation, a sum of PC 36:5 and PC 38:6 levels **greater than 60 micromolar** in plasma is correlated with an Omega-3 Index greater than 8%. This level is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease outcomes.

## Personal Metabolomic Data: Trends and Correlations

Personal metabolomic data tracked over approximately three years (19 tests) reveals the following trends:

*   **Average PC 36:5 + PC 38:6 Levels:**
    *   2023 (first 5 tests): 98 micromolar
    *   2024 (9 tests): 89 micromolar
    *   2025 (first 5 tests): 80 micromolar

While these levels consistently remained above the optimal 60 micromolar threshold, a downward trend was observed.

### Correlation with Sardine Intake

A positive, but not statistically significant (P > 0.05), correlation was found between average daily sardine intake and the sum of PC 36:5 and PC 38:6 levels. This is noteworthy as sardines are the primary source of fish oil fatty acids in the diet.

### Correlation with Other Foods

Analysis of correlations between 53 foods and the sum of PC 36:5 and PC 38:6 revealed:

*   **Positively Correlated Foods (Higher intake associated with higher PC levels):**
    *   Cloves
    *   Corn
    *   Bananas
    *   *Sardines ranked lower than these statistically significant foods.*

*   **Negatively Correlated Foods (Higher intake associated with lower PC levels):**
    *   Tomato
    *   Eggs

## Personal Strategy Based on Correlations

Based on the observed correlations, a personalized strategy was implemented for the most recent test:

*   **Aiming for Higher Intake:** Cloves and corn were consumed at higher levels.
*   **Reducing Intake:** Eggs were consumed at lower levels.
*   **Not Following Correlation:**
    *   Banana intake was reduced due to concerns about fructose and RDW.
    *   Sardine intake was on the lower side of the normal range.
    *   Tomato intake was not reduced, as tomatoes correlate positively with many other biomarkers.

The impact of these dietary adjustments on future metabolomic test results will be monitored.
