# 2024-08-07 17.6y Younger Biological Age Blood Test 5 In 2024

### Executive Summary
*   Biological age calculated using the phenotypic age calculator is 33.9 years, which is 17.6 years younger than chronological age, aligning with the lowest average biological age achieved in 2024.
*   Significant improvements in key biomarkers include HDL cholesterol reaching optimal levels (>50 mg/dL for 10 consecutive tests) and consistently low high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) at <0.3 mg/L for 18 consecutive tests.
*   Kidney function (eGFR) at 106 mL/min/1.73m² is indicative of a biological age approximately 20 years younger than chronological age.
*   Areas identified for improvement include liver enzymes (AST/ALT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and lymphocyte count, which remains lower than optimal youth-associated levels.
*   An experimental increase in daily selenium intake (404 mg/day for 59 days) was conducted to improve the conversion of free T4 to free T3, but further adjustments are needed to optimize thyroid hormone levels.

## The Mortality Risk Curve
The death rate is high from birth to one year old, then declines, reaching its lowest point between 10 to 14 years old for all causes. After this period, the death rate increases close to linearly with age. The goal is to flatten this age-related increase in mortality risk by optimizing health and lifespan. This involves tracking and optimizing biomarkers towards youthful levels and those associated with the lowest risk of death from all causes, utilizing approaches such as exercise, diet, and supplementation.

## Biological Age Results (PhenoAge)
This blood test (the 5th in 2024 and 53rd since 2015) yielded a biological age of 33.9 years using Dr. Morgan Levine's phenotypic age calculator, which is 17.6 years younger than chronological age.

**Biological Age Trends Since 2018 (34 tests):**
*   **2018-2019 (3 tests):** Average biological age of 36.1 years.
*   **2020-2021 (12 tests):** Average biological age of 35.6 years.
*   **2022 (7 tests):** Best year to date, average biological age of 33.8 years.
*   **2023:** Increased slightly to 34.7 years, but still better than 2020-2021.
*   **2024 (first 5 tests):** Back to the best average of 33.8 years.

These trends suggest a potential slowing of biological aging. The aim is to maintain as many biomarkers as possible near youthful levels associated with the lowest risk of death for the remainder of life.

## Blood Test Logistics
Blood was drawn at 7:16 AM and results for the standard chemistry panel and CBC were available within 24 hours. This expedited process was achieved by ordering tests through Ultalabtest.com and utilizing Quest Diagnostics for blood draws. Some specialized tests, such as Candida antibodies and homocysteine, took longer to process.

## Key Biomarker Highlights

*   **HDL Cholesterol:** 54 mg/dL, now in the optimal range (50-60 mg/dL). This marks 10 consecutive tests with HDL greater than 50 mg/dL, averaging 55 mg/dL over this period. This is a significant improvement compared to the average of 44.7 mg/dL over the 43 tests prior to this improvement trend.
*   **High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP):** Less than 0.3 mg/L, which is below the limit of detection. This is the 18th consecutive test where hs-CRP has been below 0.3 mg/L. Quest has reduced its limit of detection to 0.2 mg/L, setting a new target.
*   **Glucose:** 88 mg/dL, a return to the average level after a high reading of 98 mg/dL in the previous test. This improvement is potentially attributed to:
    *   Removal of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation (5 grams/day).
    *   Reduction in average fat intake from 93 to 83 grams/day.
    *   A correlation between higher protein (including BCAAs) and fat intake with higher glucose levels has been observed in personal data.
*   **eGFR (Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate):** 106 mL/min/1.73m², a measure of kidney function derived from creatinine levels. An eGFR of 106 is typically the average for someone around 30 years old, indicating a kidney function approximately 20 years better than expected for a chronological age of 51 years, where the average eGFR is around 70. Creatinine levels are proportional to muscle mass, and no significant changes in muscle mass or workout performance were observed.
*   **Albumin:** 5 g/dL, on the high side of the normal range. Higher albumin levels are favorable, as albumin typically declines with aging, and lower levels are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.

## Areas for Improvement & Current Experiments

*   **Liver Enzymes (AST and ALT):** Both at 26 U/L. While not terrible, the lowest risk of death for these enzymes is associated with values closer to the low twenties, indicating room for improvement.
*   **Thyroid Hormones (Free T4 and Free T3):** The goal is to increase free T3 and reduce free T4, thereby improving the conversion of T4 to T3, which tends to worsen with aging.
    *   **Experiment Protocol for this test:**
        *   Averaged 404 mg of selenium per day for the 59 days between blood tests.
        *   Selenium intake was primarily increased through Brazil nut consumption.
    *   **Outcome:** A different approach is needed as this experiment did not yield the desired improvement in T4 to T3 conversion based on the current results.
    *   **Biological Pathway for T4-T3 Conversion:**
        Thyroxine (T4) -> Deiodinase enzymes (require Selenium as cofactor) -> Triiodothyronine (T3)
*   **MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume):** 94.2 fL, which measures average red blood cell volume. This value is on the high side of personal data over 50+ tests and is trending in the wrong direction, as MCV tends to increase with aging.
*   **Lymphocytes:** 1547 cells/µL. This is an improvement over the previous two tests but remains relatively low. The average for the last three tests is 1443 cells/µL, compared to an average of 1902 cells/µL for the 47 tests prior to this recent decline. Lymphocyte values around 2000 cells/µL are typical for individuals in their early twenties and are associated with the lowest risk of death from all causes. Work is needed to understand the cause of this decline and to increase lymphocyte counts closer to the 1900-2000 range.
