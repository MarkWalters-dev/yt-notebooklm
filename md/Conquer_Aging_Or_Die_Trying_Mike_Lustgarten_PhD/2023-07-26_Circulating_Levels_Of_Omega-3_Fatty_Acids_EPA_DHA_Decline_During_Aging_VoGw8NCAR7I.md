# 2023-07-26 Circulating Levels Of Omega-3 Fatty Acids EPA DHA Decline During Aging

## Executive Summary

*   Omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA decline during aging, with centenarians exhibiting significantly lower circulating levels compared to younger individuals.
*   Centenarians had 23% lower EPA and 15% lower DHA levels than their 67-year-old offspring (p-value and FDR < 0.05).
*   A meta-analysis of 17 studies (over 42,000 people) found that relatively low circulating levels of EPA and DHA are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   For EPA, very low levels increased mortality risk, while higher (but not the absolute highest) levels decreased risk.
*   For DHA and combined EPA+DHA, intermediate to relatively high circulating levels were consistently associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk.

## Decline of EPA and DHA with Aging

Omega-3 fatty acids, Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA), are known to positively impact various health conditions. They have been shown to reduce inflammation, decrease insulin resistance, and positively influence aspects of aging. In a study conducted in rats, EPA and DHA increased neurogenesis.

However, circulating levels of EPA and DHA decline during aging, a trend particularly notable in centenarians. Data comparing centenarians (around 97 years old) with their 67-year-old offspring showed that the younger age group had significantly higher levels of EPA and DHA. Specifically, centenarians had 23% lower levels of EPA and 15% lower levels of DHA. These differences were statistically significant (p-value and False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 0.05).

## Impact of EPA and DHA Levels on All-Cause Mortality

Given the decline in EPA and DHA in centenarians, the health implications of these lower levels were investigated. A meta-analysis of 17 studies, encompassing over 42,000 individuals, examined the relationship between circulating EPA and DHA levels and all-cause mortality risk.

### EPA and All-Cause Mortality

For EPA, a significant association was observed:
*   Very low circulating levels of EPA (e.g., at the 10th percentile) were associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   As circulating levels of EPA increased beyond the 10th percentile, all-cause mortality risk decreased.
*   However, extremely high levels of EPA (e.g., greater than the 90th percentile) did not show a continued significant reduction in risk, with the association becoming non-significant.
*   Overall, relatively low circulating levels of EPA were associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk, while relatively higher levels (but not necessarily the very highest) were associated with a decreased risk.

### DHA and All-Cause Mortality

For DHA:
*   Once circulating levels of DHA reached approximately the 50th percentile, higher levels were associated with a significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk.
*   Intermediate and relatively high circulating levels of DHA were consistently associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk.

### Combined EPA and DHA and All-Cause Mortality

When EPA and DHA were combined, the trend was somewhat similar to EPA, with very low levels associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk. However, for combined levels higher than the 10th percentile, there was a near-linear trend where relatively higher levels were associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk.

This meta-analysis indicates that relatively high circulating levels of both EPA and DHA are associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk, suggesting that the lower levels observed in centenarians may not be beneficial for health.

## Personal Metabolomic Data

Metabolomic testing can provide insight into circulating levels of various compounds, including EPA and DHA. The kit used for personal testing provides data for 500 metabolites, including key components of metabolic pathways relevant to longevity.

One example is the de novo NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) synthesis pathway, which includes kynurenine and tryptophan. This pathway can be visualized as:

Tryptophan -> Kynurenine -> NAD

Other metabolites measured include taurine and polyamines, which have been linked to lifespan extension, and metabolite ratios as indicators of oxidative stress.

Personal data from two tests (April and May) showed circulating levels of EPA at 2.6 micromolar and DHA at 6.7 micromolar. While defining an optimal precise reference range from untargeted metabolomic studies can be challenging, a reasonable goal is to aim for levels that avoid the age-related decline observed in EPA and DHA, especially given the association between relatively low levels and increased all-cause mortality risk. Maintaining levels that help mitigate this age-related decline is considered a beneficial strategy.
