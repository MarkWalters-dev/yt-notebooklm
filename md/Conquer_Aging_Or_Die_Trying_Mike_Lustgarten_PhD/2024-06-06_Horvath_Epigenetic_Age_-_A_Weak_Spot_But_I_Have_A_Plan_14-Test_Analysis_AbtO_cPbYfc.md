# 2024-06-06 Horvath Epigenetic Age - A Weak Spot But I Have A Plan 14-Test Analysis

**Executive Summary:**
*   The Horvath clock demonstrates a strong linear correlation (r=0.94, p<0.05) with chronological age, indicating its accuracy as an epigenetic age predictor.
*   The individual's Horvath epigenetic age has consistently been older than their chronological age, with the most recent test (chronological age 51) showing an epigenetic age of 58 years.
*   Analysis of 14 blood tests revealed statistically significant positive correlations (p<0.05) between Horvath epigenetic age and higher intakes of protein, total fat, saturated fat, and coconut butter.
*   Conversely, higher intakes of salt (1700-1800 mg/day range) and cloves were inversely correlated with Horvath epigenetic age, suggesting an association with a younger epigenetic age.
*   The plan to reduce intake of protein, total fat, saturated fat, and coconut butter is supported by their net negative correlative scores with a panel of 25 other biomarkers, suggesting a potential for broad health improvements.

## Horvath Epigenetic Clock Overview
The Horvath clock is identified as the most effective epigenetic clock for predicting chronological age, utilizing DNA methylation (DNAmh) data. A strong linear relationship exists between DNAmh age (epigenetic age) and chronological age, with a correlation coefficient of 0.94 and a p-value significantly below 0.05. This indicates a near-perfect positive correlation, as 1.0 represents perfect linearity. The clock is effective across multiple cell types and tissues.

## Personal Horvath Epigenetic Age Data

**Recent Test (April 29, 2024):**
*   **Chronological Age:** Slightly older than 51 years.
*   **Intrinsic/Horvath Epigenetic Age:** 58 years.
*   This represents an epigenetic age 7 years older than chronological age.

**Historical Trends (14 tests, 2022-2024):**
*   **2022 (3 tests):** Average Horvath epigenetic age was 55 years, averaging 6 years older than chronological age.
*   **2023 (8 tests):** Average Horvath epigenetic age improved to 52.8 years, a 2.2-year reduction from the 2022 average.
*   **2024 (3 tests, including recent data point):** Current average is 54.2 years.
*   Overall, over a two-and-a-half-year period, there has been minimal change in the average Horvath epigenetic age, which consistently remains older than chronological age.
*   At least one test during this period showed a Horvath epigenetic age younger than chronological age.

## Methodology for Dietary Correlation Analysis

To identify dietary correlations with biomarkers, the following step-by-step approach is used:

*   **Step 1: Food Weighing:** Since 2015, all food intake is precisely weighed using a food scale.
*   **Step 2: Dietary Tracking:** Food amounts are entered into the dietary tracking application Cronometer.
*   **Step 3: Data Transfer:** Data from Cronometer (including food intake, macronutrients, and micronutrients) is manually entered into a spreadsheet.
*   **Step 4: Blood Test Correlation:** Each blood test is linked to a corresponding average dietary intake. For instance, if a 50-day period exists between blood tests, the average dietary intake over those 50 days is associated with the later blood test.
*   **Step 5: Correlation Calculation:** Once sufficient data from multiple blood tests (typically three or more) is accumulated, correlations between dietary intake and biomarker levels are calculated. This ongoing process helps to refine understanding of optimal intakes over time.

## Dietary Correlations with Horvath Epigenetic Age

An analysis of 105 dietary comparisons (foods, macronutrients, micronutrients) with Horvath epigenetic age across 14 tests revealed six statistically significant correlations (p < 0.05).

**Positive Correlations (Higher Intake -> Older Epigenetic Age):**
*   Protein
*   Total Fat
*   Saturated Fat
*   Coconut Butter
    *   *Interpretation:* Higher relative intakes of these items were associated with less favorable Horvath epigenetic age data compared to periods of lower intake.

**Inverse Correlations (Higher Intake -> Younger Epigenetic Age):**
*   **Salt:** Higher intake, specifically in the 1700-1800 mg/day range, was significantly correlated with a younger Horvath epigenetic age.
*   **Cloves:** Cloves were historically removed from the diet for a period and have since been reintroduced to further test this correlation.

## Future Action Plan and Multi-Biomarker Impact

For an upcoming test (Test #16), the strategy is to adjust dietary intake based on the observed correlations:

*   **Targeting Lower Intake for Positive Correlates:**
    *   **Protein:** Aim for approximately 95 grams per day.
    *   **Total Fat:** Aim for approximately 80 grams per day.
    *   **Saturated Fat:** Aim for 18 grams or less per day.
    *   **Coconut Butter:** Aim for 8 grams or less per day.
    *   *Rationale:* Reducing intake of these items (protein, total fat, saturated fat, coconut butter) is hypothesized to improve Horvath epigenetic age, aligning with the observed positive correlations.

*   **Monitoring Correlation Persistence:** The strength of these correlations will be re-evaluated after subsequent tests. If the correlations weaken, it suggests they may not be causally linked, and new top correlations will be pursued.

**Cross-Biomarker Analysis:**
The goal is to optimize Horvath epigenetic age without negatively impacting other biomarkers. An analysis of the net correlative score for protein, total fat, saturated fat, and coconut butter with 25 other biomarkers provides insights:

*   **Protein:** Net correlative score of -5.
*   **Total Fat:** Net negative correlation.
*   **Saturated Fat:** Net negative correlation.
*   **Coconut Butter:** Net negative correlation.
    *   *Interpretation:* A negative net correlative score indicates that higher intakes of these nutrients are associated with a net detrimental effect on a panel of 25 other biomarkers relevant to aging and all-cause mortality risk.
    *   *Conclusion:* Reducing the intake of protein, total fat, saturated fat, and coconut butter is expected to not only potentially improve Horvath epigenetic age but also beneficially influence a broad range of other biomarkers across multiple organ systems. The validity of this hypothesis will be assessed in future tests.
