# 2023-04-30 AnthropoAge - Biological Age Prediction Without Blood Testing

## Executive Summary

*   **AnthropoAge Performance:** AnthropoAge demonstrates an association with all-cause mortality risk comparable to PhenoAge, a well-established biological age predictor that relies on blood test data.
*   **Broad Mortality Association:** Both simplified (s-AnthropoAge) and full AnthropoAge measures are significantly associated with all-cause mortality and a range of cause-specific mortality outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke, cancer, and kidney-related issues.
*   **No Blood Required:** A key advantage of AnthropoAge is its ability to estimate biological age using only anthropometric measures, eliminating the need for blood tests.
*   **Anthropometric Measures:** The calculation of AnthropoAge involves standard measurements like chronological age, height, weight, waist circumference, and sex/race/ethnicity for the simplified version, with the full version additionally incorporating thigh and upper arm circumference, and skinfold thickness for women.
*   **Mortality Risk Insight:** AnthropoAge acceleration (or deceleration) provides an indication of an individual's estimated ten-year mortality risk relative to their chronological age.

## Introduction to AnthropoAge

AnthropoAge is a novel approach to estimating biological age that integrates body composition measures, aiming to provide an assessment without the requirement of blood tests. This contrasts with existing biological age calculators like PhenoAge and aging.ai.

## AnthropoAge vs. PhenoAge for Mortality Risk

Data generated from the NHANES three and four studies, involving over 17,000 participants, were used to compare the predictive power of AnthropoAge and PhenoAge for mortality risk.

### All-Cause Mortality Association

Both simplified (s-AnthropoAge) and full AnthropoAge measures were evaluated against PhenoAge for their association with all-cause mortality risk.

*   The hazard ratios for both AnthropoAge measures were significantly above one, indicating a significant association with all-cause mortality risk.
*   The 95% confidence intervals for these hazard ratios were also above one, further supporting the statistical significance.
*   PhenoAge also showed a significant association with all-cause mortality risk, with its hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval above one.
*   **Conclusion:** AnthropoAge is as effective as PhenoAge in its association with all-cause mortality risk.

### Cause-Specific Mortality Association

AnthropoAge was also compared with PhenoAge for its associations with cause-specific mortality. The investigated causes included:

*   Cardiovascular disease
*   Diabetes
*   Stroke
*   Cancer
*   Influenza or pneumonia
*   Kidney-related issues (nephritis or nephrosis)
*   Deaths related to Alzheimer's disease
*   Chronic lower respiratory disease

For each of these outcomes:

*   AnthropoAge showed a significant association, with hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals consistently above one.
*   PhenoAge also demonstrated significant associations with these cause-specific mortality outcomes, with its hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals above one.
*   **Conclusion:** AnthropoAge is as effective as PhenoAge for associations with cause-specific mortality.

## Measures Included in AnthropoAge

The calculation of biological age using AnthropoAge varies depending on whether the simplified (s-AnthropoAge) or the full version is used.

### Simplified AnthropoAge (s-AnthropoAge) Calculation Protocol

1.  **Enter Chronological Age:** Input your current age.
2.  **Enter Height:** Measure your height using a tape measure.
3.  **Enter Weight:** Measure your weight using a body weight scale.
4.  **Enter Waist Circumference:** Measure your waist circumference using a tape measure.
5.  **Enter Sex, Race, or Ethnicity:** Provide demographic information.
6.  **Toggle s-AnthropoAge Estimate:** Ensure the option to "only estimate s-AnthropoAge" is toggled to the right.
7.  **Submit:** Click the submit button to receive your predicted s-AnthropoAge.

**Output:** The calculator provides a predicted s-AnthropoAge and calculates AnthropoAge acceleration by subtracting this from your chronological age. A negative value indicates that your ten-year mortality risk is lower than expected for your chronological age.

### Full AnthropoAge Calculation Protocol

1.  **Enter Chronological Age:** Input your current age.
2.  **Enter Height:** Measure your height using a tape measure.
3.  **Enter Weight:** Measure your weight using a body weight scale.
4.  **Enter Waist Circumference:** Measure your waist circumference using a tape measure.
5.  **Enter Thigh Circumference:** Measure the circumference of your thigh at its midpoint using a tape measure.
6.  **Enter Upper Arm Circumference:** Measure the circumference of your upper arm at its midpoint using a tape measure.
7.  **For Women:**
    *   **Triceps Skinfold Thickness:** Use skinfold calipers to measure the skinfold thickness on the back of the upper arm (behind the triceps).
    *   **Subscapular Skinfold Thickness:** Measure the skinfold thickness just below the scapula on the back.
8.  **Enter Sex, Race, or Ethnicity:** Provide demographic information.
9.  **Toggle s-AnthropoAge Estimate:** Ensure the option to "only estimate s-AnthropoAge" is toggled **off** to enable the full AnthropoAge estimation.
10. **Submit:** Click the submit button to receive your predicted full AnthropoAge.

**Output:** The calculator provides a predicted full AnthropoAge. Similar to the simplified version, AnthropoAge acceleration is calculated by subtracting this from your chronological age. A value less than your chronological age indicates non-accelerated aging, suggesting a lower than expected ten-year mortality risk.
