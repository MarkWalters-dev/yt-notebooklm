# 2025-04-06 Dietary AGE Products Impact Insulin Resistance And Inflammation - Jaime Uribarri M.D.

## Executive Summary

*   Dietary Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs), formed during high-heat cooking and food processing, significantly contribute to the body's total AGE pool.
*   High dietary AGE intake drives inflammation, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance, playing a role in the development of chronic non-transmissible diseases like type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.
*   Implementing a low AGE diet, primarily through modified cooking techniques (lower heat, increased moisture, shorter duration), reduces circulating AGE levels and improves markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and insulin sensitivity in individuals with diabetes and metabolic syndrome.
*   AGEs interact with the gut microbiota, and unabsorbed dietary AGEs in the colon can influence disease processes beyond direct absorption.
*   Ultra-processed foods, which constitute a large portion of caloric intake in Western diets, are major sources of dietary AGEs due to thermal processing, suggesting AGEs are a significant contributor to the adverse health outcomes associated with these foods.

## Introduction to Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs)

Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs) are a diverse group of compounds resulting from the spontaneous, non-enzymatic reaction between a carbonyl group of a reducing sugar and free amino groups in proteins. This process is also known as the Maillard or browning reaction. While historically associated with glucose, AGEs can form from various reactions, even in the absence of glucose.

**AGE Formation Pathway:**

Reducing Sugar + Free Amino Group (in protein) -> Series of Reactions -> AGEs

Common AGEs include carboxymethyl lysine (CML) and pentosidine.

## Pathogenic Mechanisms of AGEs

AGEs are intrinsically linked to chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, which are underlying causes of tissue damage in chronic non-transmissible diseases such. As diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.

AGEs exert their effects through two main mechanisms:

1.  **Protein Cross-linking:** AGEs can directly cross-link proteins, altering their structure and function. For example, collagen cross-linking can lead to tissue stiffening and dysfunction.
2.  **Receptor Interaction:** AGEs interact with specific cellular receptors, primarily the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products (RAGE).

**Cellular Signaling via RAGE and R1:**

High AGEs:
AGEs -> RAGE Receptor Activation (on cell surface) -> Increased Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Production + NF-κB Pathway Stimulation -> Increased Inflammatory Cytokines

Protective Mechanism:
AGEs -> R1 Receptor Activation -> R1 catabolizes and degrades AGEs via endocytosis
R1 Activation -> Stimulates SIRT1 -> Opposes RAGE-mediated NF-κB activation

Therefore, high R1 activity is beneficial, while high RAGE activity is detrimental.

## Dietary AGEs in Humans

While AGEs are endogenously generated, particularly in hyperglycemic conditions (e.g., diabetes), a significant source comes from diet. AGEs are naturally present in all foods, but their levels are greatly amplified by processing and cooking food under high heat.

**Factors Influencing Food AGE Content:**

*   **Temperature:** Higher temperatures lead to more AGE formation.
*   **Duration of Heating:** Longer cooking times increase AGE production.
*   **pH:** Higher pH promotes AGE formation.
*   **Moisture Content:** More water/moisture reduces AGE formation.
*   **Presence of Heavy Metals:** Can influence AGE formation.
*   **Food Composition:** Foods rich in protein and fat contain the highest levels of AGEs.

**Cooking Methods and AGE Generation (Example: Chicken):**

*   **Boiled Chicken:** Lower AGEs (e.g., 1000 kU/g)
*   **Broiled Chicken (same duration):** Significantly higher AGEs (e.g., 8000 kU/g)

Broiling and frying generally result in the highest AGE levels, followed by roasting and grilling. Western diets, characterized by processed meats, sweet snacks, and refined grains, are typically high in AGEs. The increased palatability of these foods is partly due to AGE generation during cooking.

**Low AGE Diet Principles:**

A low AGE diet is achieved primarily through culinary technique modification rather than food restriction:

*   **Temperature:** Use lower cooking temperatures.
*   **Duration:** Cook for shorter periods.
*   **Moisture:** Increase moisture content (e.g., boiling, stewing, steaming).
*   **pH:** Adjust pH where feasible (though cooking technique is primary).
*   **Cooking Surface:** Avoid excessive browning.
*   **Herbs, Spices, and Condiments:** Incorporate these, as many possess anti-glycation and antioxidant properties.
*   **Food Processing:** Minimize consumption of highly processed foods.

## Intervention Studies: Low AGE Diets

Multiple human intervention studies have demonstrated the clinical relevance of dietary AGEs.

### Study 1: Diabetic Patients (Crossover Design, 2002)

**Methodology:**

*   Diabetic patients participated in a crossover study.
*   **Group A:** High AGE diet -> 1-week washout -> Low AGE diet
*   **Group B:** Low AGE diet -> 1-week washout -> High AGE diet
*   All meals were prepared at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine Clinical Research Center.

**Findings:**

*   **High AGE Diet:** Increased markers of AGEs (e.g., CML, methylglyoxal-derived AGEs, AGE-LDL) and markers of disease (e.g., C-reactive protein, TNF-α, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 - VCAM-1).
*   **Low AGE Diet:** Decreased markers of AGEs and reduced markers of disease.

This study showed that dietary AGEs directly influence circulating AGE levels and inflammatory/disease biomarkers, even with consistent glucose levels.

### Study 2: Diabetic Patients with Insulin Resistance (Outpatient, 4 months, 2011)

**Methodology:**

*   Diabetic patients with insulin resistance, consuming a habitual high AGE diet, were randomized.
*   **Group 1:** Continued habitual high AGE diet for 4 months.
*   **Group 2:** Switched to a low AGE diet for 4 months, achieved by modifying cooking methods at home.
*   Dietitians regularly monitored patient adherence.

**Findings (Low AGE Diet Group):**

*   **Reduced AGE Markers:** CML levels decreased.
*   **Reduced Inflammation:** TNF-α and RAGE receptor levels decreased.
*   **Reduced Oxidative Stress:** 8-isoprostane levels decreased.
*   **Improved Insulin Sensitivity:** Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) decreased, indicating reduced insulin resistance.
*   **Increased Protective Receptors:** R1 receptor and SIRT1 levels increased.

### Study 3: Patients with Metabolic Syndrome (Outpatient, 12 months, 2016)

**Methodology:**

*   Similar to Study 2, but extended the intervention to 12 months in patients with metabolic syndrome.
*   Patients prepared meals at home with regular dietitian contact.

**Findings:**

*   Results were consistently similar to the 4-month diabetes study.
*   The low AGE diet reduced AGE markers (CML), inflammation (TNF-α, RAGE), oxidative stress (8-isoprostane), and improved HOMA-IR, while increasing R1 and SIRT1.

### Mouse Data

Feeding Little (dwarf) mice a high AGE diet has been shown to induce various diseases, including type 1 and type 2 diabetes, vascular disease, kidney disease, and insulin resistance. Conversely, randomly assigning these mice to a low AGE diet prevents disease development. Studies have also shown that a high AGE diet can negate the lifespan-extending effects of calorie restriction in mice.

### In Vitro Evidence

In vitro studies demonstrate that AGEs contribute to insulin resistance by:

*   Reducing insulin's affinity for its receptor through glycation of the insulin molecule.
*   Decreasing insulin-dependent phosphorylation and GLUT4 expression in skeletal muscle cells, impairing glucose uptake.

## AGEs and the Microbiota

A small percentage of ingested AGEs are directly absorbed into circulation and primarily excreted by the kidneys. However, the majority of unabsorbed AGEs reach the colon. In the colon, AGEs interact with the gut microbiota.

**AGE-Microbiota Interaction:**

High Dietary AGEs -> Unabsorbed AGEs reach Colon -> React with Microbiota -> May be catabolized or Induce Formation of New Products -> Stimulate RAGE in Colonic Wall -> Contributes to Disease

This suggests that the impact of high AGE foods extends beyond direct absorption, affecting gut health and potentially systemic disease through microbiota-mediated mechanisms. The high AGE diet has been shown to alter the microbiota composition in human subjects.

## The AGE Hypothesis

The proposed AGE hypothesis integrates both endogenous and exogenous sources of AGEs in disease progression.

**The AGE Hypothesis Flowchart:**

**Endogenous Sources**
Hyperglycemia (e.g., in Diabetes)
-> Contributes to Body AGE Pool

**Exogenous Sources**
Dietary AGEs (from high-heat cooking, processed foods)
Tobacco
Intraluminal Fructose-derived AGEs (from high fructose diet, particularly with malabsorption or impaired protein digestion)
-> Contributes to Body AGE Pool

**Combined Body AGE Pool**
-> Protein Cross-linking
-> Oxidative Stress
-> Inflammation

**Long-term Effects**
-> Chronic Non-infectious Diseases (Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome, Cardiovascular Disease, Chronic Kidney Disease)

Interruption of this cycle by affecting dietary AGE intake is hypothesized to prevent or mitigate these chronic diseases.

## Ultra-Processed Foods and AGEs

The NOVA classification categorizes foods by their degree of processing, with Group 4 being ultra-processed foods. In countries like the United States, ultra-processed foods account for approximately 60% of caloric intake. Epidemiological studies link high ultra-processed food intake to an increased incidence of diabetes and other chronic conditions.

Thermal ultra-processing of food generates AGEs, making them a major factor in the negative health outcomes associated with these foods. The industrial machinery used in food processing frequently employs thermal application, analogous to high-heat home cooking but on a larger, more controlled scale.

**Arguments for Dietary AGEs as a Major Contributor to Disease:**

*   AGEs and other reaction products are generated during thermal food processing.
*   Food-derived AGEs are structurally and physiologically identical to endogenously formed AGEs.
*   AGEs (e.g., CML) cause tissue injury in various cell systems and tissues.
*   Oral administration of labeled AGEs in humans shows absorption into circulation, partial excretion, and retention in circulation/tissues.
*   High AGE diets in mouse models induce insulin resistance, which is preventable by low AGE diets.
*   Healthy humans on AGE-rich diets show increased markers of inflammation and insulin resistance.
*   Patients with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes on low AGE diets show reversal of inflammation markers and improved insulin resistance.

## Challenges and Future Directions

The field of dietary AGE research faces several challenges:

*   **Diversity of AGEs:** Numerous types of AGEs exist, making it difficult to pinpoint the most significant ones for research and clinical targeting.
*   **Measurement Methods:** Variability in measurement techniques (fluorescence, ELISA, mass spectrometry) leads to inconsistent data and a lack of universal agreement on the best methods.
*   **Confounders in Intervention Trials:** Factors like caloric intake, weight changes, and the destruction of beneficial compounds (e.g., vitamins, polyphenols) during cooking can confound results, though efforts are made to control for them.
*   **Lack of Collaboration:** Disagreements among food scientists, biochemists, and clinicians hinder progress.
*   **Conflicting Epidemiological Data:** Studies on plasma CML and health outcomes show mixed results, with some reporting no association or even inverse associations (e.g., lower CML in obesity, higher in some vegetarian diets, or lower mortality risk). These discrepancies may arise from different measurement methods (e.g., ELISA vs. mass spectrometry), unmeasured AGEs, or the complexity of dietary patterns.

**Future Research Directions:**

*   Refine the understanding of mechanisms linking high dietary AGEs to disease using advanced techniques.
*   Further explore the interaction between AGEs and the microbiome.
*   Establish agreement on the most representative AGEs and best measurement methods to develop clinical recommendations and guidelines.
*   Investigate the effect of prolonged low AGE diets on the progression and complications of chronic kidney disease, aiming to prevent end-stage renal disease.
*   Advocate for medical societies, governments, and institutions to acknowledge and act upon data regarding dietary AGEs.

**Conclusion:**

The proposed strategy for improved healthspan is simple: integrate low AGE cooking techniques into any healthy dietary pattern (e.g., Mediterranean, DASH, plant-based). This involves cooking foods with less heat, more moisture, and shorter durations to minimize AGE formation.

## Notes on Fructose and Glycation

*   Both glucose and fructose can raise endogenous AGE formation if consumed in excess.
*   Fructose is primarily metabolized by the liver, so circulating levels are typically low, but high intake can still contribute to AGEs.
*   High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) can lead to relative fructose malabsorption if the fructose-to-glucose ratio is unfavorable, causing fructose to remain in the intestinal lumen.
*   In the intestinal lumen, fructose can react with free amino acids at intestinal pH, forming fructose-derived AGEs that are then absorbed.
*   In vitro, fructose glycates faster than glucose.
*   Minimizing excessive intake of both fructose and protein may reduce the amount of unabsorbed compounds reaching the colon, thus limiting intraluminal AGE formation.
*   Biomarkers like glycated albumin (fructosamine) could be used to monitor changes in glycation more rapidly than HbA1c, which reflects longer-term glucose control.
