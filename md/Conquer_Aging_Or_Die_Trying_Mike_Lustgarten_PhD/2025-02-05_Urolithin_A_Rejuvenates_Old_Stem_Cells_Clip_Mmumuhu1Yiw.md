# 2025-02-05 Urolithin A Rejuvenates Old Stem Cells Clip

*   Urolithin A, a mitophagy-activating compound, has been shown to rejuvenate old hematopoietic stem cells.
*   Nicotinamide Riboside improved dysfunctional and aged immune cells in mice.
*   These "gerit therapeutics" function by enhancing the function of existing cells, rather than eliminating pathogenic cells like senolytics.
*   Urolithin A is derived from precursors found in pomegranates, converted by gut microbiota.

## Mitophagy-Activating Compounds

The field of mitophagy and mitophagy-activating compounds is actively researched for its potential in cellular rejuvenation.

## Specific Findings

*   **Urolithin A:** Research by Nicola Venini's group demonstrated that Urolithin A was sufficient to rejuvenate old hematopoietic stem cells.
*   **Nicotinamide Riboside:** Studies in mice have shown that Nicotinamide Riboside benefited dysfunctional and aged immune cells.

## Mechanism of Action

These compounds, considered "gerit therapeutics," appear to improve the function of existing cells. This mechanism distinguishes them from senolytics, which primarily work by eliminating pathogenic (senescent) cells. The focus is on enhancing existing cellular performance rather than removal.

## Source and Delivery Considerations

Urolithin A is a postbiotic metabolite derived from ellagitannins, compounds found in foods like pomegranates. These ellagitannins are converted into Urolithin A by specific gut bacteria. While dietary intake of precursors exists, supplementation provides a measurable and guaranteed dose, potentially avoiding high glucose intake from fruit and ensuring therapeutic levels.
