# 2022-08-28 Epigenetic Tests 1 and 2 - Horvath Hannum DunedinPACE

*   Personal Horvath Intrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration (IEAA) was consistently 4-6 years older than chronological age, potentially indicating a lack of longevity genes.
*   Personal Hannum Extrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration (EEAA) was consistently 12 years younger than chronological age, suggesting youthful immune system aging.
*   DunedinPACE, a measure of the pace of epigenetic aging, indicated a relatively slow personal aging rate (0.8-0.82) compared to the slowest observed (0.6).
*   DunedinPACE uniquely detected a younger biological age in calorie-restricted individuals (12% CR over 2 years) compared to ad libitum controls, a finding not observed with Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, or GrimAge clocks.
*   While Horvath (correlation 0.94-0.85) and Hannum (correlation 0.68) show strong correlations with chronological age, their association with all-cause mortality risk is weaker (hazard ratio ~1.014-1.029) compared to DunedinPACE, PhenoAge, and GrimAge.

## Introduction to Epigenetic Age Testing

This study note examines biological age using epigenetic testing, focusing on Horvath's Intrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration (IEAA), Hannum's Extrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration (EEAA), and DunedinPACE. These tests assess different aspects of aging and their correlations with chronological age and all-cause mortality risk. Personal epigenetic data from two time points (May 26, 2022, and July 11, 2022) are presented for each clock.

## Horvath's Epigenetic Test (IEAA)

Horvath's epigenetic test, specifically Intrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration (IEAA), measures cell-intrinsic aging.

*   **Correlation with Chronological Age:**
    *   Horvath's epigenetic clock demonstrates a strong correlation with chronological age.
    *   Correlation coefficients for two iterations of the Horvath clock are 0.94 and 0.85.
    *   These correlations are highly statistically significant (p-values < 1 x 10^-200).
    *   The clock is multi-cell and multi-tissue, with data from various cell types including breast, buccal (cheek), brain, cerebellum, colon, cord blood, and dermis (skin).

*   **Association with All-Cause Mortality Risk:**
    *   IEAA is significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Methodology:** A meta-analysis of 13 studies, including over 13,000 individuals.
    *   **Finding:** A relatively higher IEAA (older Horvath epigenetic age) is significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Hazard Ratio (HR):** The meta-analysis found a small hazard ratio of 1.014, meaning an increase in Horvath epigenetic age increases all-cause mortality risk by 1.4%.

*   **Personal Horvath Epigenetic Age:**
    *   **Test 1 (May 26, 2022):** 54.99 years, which was 6 years older than the chronological age of 49.3 years.
    *   **Test 2 (July 11, 2022):** 53.52 years, which was 4 years older than chronological age.
    *   **Observation:** Both tests indicated an older Horvath epigenetic age relative to chronological age.
    *   **Context:** Centenarian offspring (children of individuals living beyond 100 years) typically exhibit a lower IEAA compared to age-matched controls, suggesting a genetic component to this measure.

## Hannum's Epigenetic Test (EEAA)

Hannum's epigenetic test, known as Extrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration (EEAA), is a marker of immune system aging.

*   **Correlation with Chronological Age:**
    *   Hannum's epigenetic clock is significantly correlated with chronological age.
    *   The correlation coefficient is 0.68, which is statistically significant (p-value < 1 x 10^-200).
    *   This correlation, while significant, is not as strong as that observed for the Horvath test.

*   **Association with All-Cause Mortality Risk:**
    *   A relatively higher EEAA (older Hannum epigenetic age) is significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Methodology:** The same meta-analysis of 13 studies used for Horvath's test.
    *   **Finding:** A higher EEAA is significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Hazard Ratio (HR):** The hazard ratio is 1.029, indicating a 2.9% increase in all-cause mortality risk for a relatively older Hannum epigenetic age. This is slightly stronger than the association for the Horvath test.

*   **Immune System Parameters:** EEAA incorporates various immune cell proportions and amounts:
    *   B cells
    *   CD4 T cells
    *   CD8 T cells
    *   CD4/CD8 T cell ratio
    *   Natural Killer (NK) cells
    *   Total lymphocytes
    *   Neutrophils
    *   Monocytes
    *   Eosinophils

*   **Personal Hannum Epigenetic Age:**
    *   **Test 1 (May 26, 2022):** 36.87 years, which was 12 years younger than chronological age.
    *   **Test 2 (July 11, 2022):** 37.47 years, also 12 years younger than chronological age.
    *   **Observation:** Both tests consistently showed a Hannum epigenetic age 12 years younger than chronological age, suggesting youthful immune system aging.

## Dunedin PACE

Dunedin PACE, which stands for "Pace of Aging Calculated from the Epigenome," is derived from the Dunedin Study in New Zealand. It measures the rate of epigenetic aging.

*   **Correlation with Chronological Age:**
    *   Dunedin PACE is significantly correlated with chronological age.
    *   The correlation coefficient is 0.32 for both men and women.
    *   This correlation is weaker than those observed for Horvath (0.94, 0.85) and Hannum (0.68) epigenetic tests.

*   **Association with All-Cause Mortality Risk:**
    *   Dunedin PACE demonstrates an association with all-cause mortality risk comparable to leading epigenetic clocks like PhenoAge and GrimAge.
    *   **Study 1: Normative Aging Study (men only)**
        *   Horvath and Hannum tests: Not significantly associated with all-cause mortality (confidence intervals overlapped 1).
        *   Dunedin PACE (including Dunedin POAM), PhenoAge, and GrimAge: Each significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Study 2: Framingham Offspring Study (men and women)**
        *   Horvath test: Not significantly associated with all-cause mortality.
        *   Hannum, PhenoAge, GrimAge, and Dunedin PACE (including Dunedin POAM): Each significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality risk. GrimAge exhibited the largest hazard ratio.

*   **Detection of Biological Age Reduction by Calorie Restriction (CR):**
    *   Dunedin PACE uniquely identifies a younger biological age in individuals undergoing calorie restriction, a finding not replicated by other major epigenetic clocks.
    *   **Methodology:** A 2-year randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving calorie restriction, with an average 12% calorie reduction over the period.
    *   **Baseline:** No significant differences in epigenetic age between calorie-restricted and ad libitum groups at the start.
    *   **Findings on CR:**
        *   **Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, GrimAge, and Dunedin POAM:** Showed no significant differences in epigenetic aging changes between the calorie-restricted and ad libitum groups over the 2-year period.
        *   **Dunedin PACE:** Significantly detected a younger epigenetic age (or reduced change in epigenetic age) in the calorie-restricted group at both the 12-month and 24-month time points, compared to the ad libitum controls.

*   **Personal Dunedin PACE Data:**
    *   **Test 1 (May 26, 2022):** Dunedin PACE value of 0.8.
    *   **Test 2 (July 11, 2022):** Dunedin PACE value of 0.82.
    *   **Interpretation:** A Dunedin PACE value of 0.8 means that for every 1 year of chronological age, epigenetic age increases by 0.8 years.
        *   The slowest observed epigenetic aging rate is 0.6.
        *   The fastest observed epigenetic aging rate is 1.4.
    *   **Observation:** The personal Dunedin PACE values (0.8 and 0.82) indicate a relatively slow epigenetic aging rate, suggesting positive progress, with some room for further improvement towards the slowest rate of 0.6.

## Summary of Personal Epigenetic Results

Based on the epigenetic tests:

*   **Horvath (IEAA):** Consistently measured 4-6 years older than chronological age, indicating a relatively older cell-intrinsic aging profile. This may be partly explained by the absence of documented longevity genes within the immediate family (longest-lived relative 95 years).
*   **Hannum (EEAA):** Consistently measured 12 years younger than chronological age, suggesting youthful immune system aging.
*   **Dunedin PACE:** Consistently measured a relatively slow epigenetic aging rate (0.8-0.82), which is favorable, though there is potential for further reduction towards the slowest observed rate of 0.6.
