# 2025-04-29 Dave Pascoe Presents His Blood Test Results - PSA Testosterone SHBG

## Executive Summary

*   **PSA Trend:** Total PSA has doubled over the past five years, indicating a concerning upward trend that warrants attention.
*   **Free PSA Decline:** The percentage of free PSA is declining, which, when below 15-10%, is associated with increased prostate cancer risk.
*   **Testosterone Resistance to Aging:** Despite no significant weight loss, total testosterone levels are increasing, potentially due to lifestyle factors like exercise or genetic predisposition, resisting age-related decline.
*   **High SHBG Impact on Free Testosterone:** Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is elevated, leading to low free testosterone levels. This is a complex marker with conflicting associations regarding longevity and disease risk.
*   **DHT Direction:** Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is trending towards a more optimal range, which is viewed positively for hair health.

## Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)

*   **Total PSA Trend:**
    *   The trend line indicates approximately a doubling of total PSA over the past five years.
    *   The current total PSA is about double what it was five years ago based on the trend.
    *   Optimal PSA levels in youth can be as low as 0.3.
    *   A five-year doubling time for PSA is a significant concern, as healthy doubling times are estimated to be much longer (30-50 years).
*   **Free PSA Percentage:**
    *   The percentage of free PSA is declining, moving in the wrong direction.
    *   A free PSA percentage less than 15% or less than 10% is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer.
    *   Current free PSA percentage is outside the optimal range, though it is higher than the risk threshold.

## Testosterone

*   **Total Testosterone:**
    *   Total testosterone has been increasing, resisting the typical age-related decline.
    *   This increase has occurred despite no significant changes in body composition (not getting leaner).
    *   **Factors influencing testosterone:**
        *   Leaner BMI is generally associated with higher testosterone.
        *   Increased BMI tends to lead to lower testosterone.
        *   The increase suggests that lifestyle interventions or genetic factors may be contributing.
    *   **Potential interventions:**
        *   Regular physical activity and running have been observed to increase testosterone levels.
        *   Avoiding prolonged sitting is important, as it can lower testosterone.
*   **Free Testosterone:**
    *   Free testosterone levels are noted as being "quite low."
    *   This is directly linked to high levels of Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG).
    *   There are published studies linking low free testosterone to increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   Conversely, studies on calorie restriction (CR) by Luigi Fontana suggest that lower androgen levels (including free testosterone) in CR individuals may be associated with anti-cancer effects. The translation of this to humans is uncertain.

## Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG)

*   **Elevated SHBG:**
    *   SHBG levels are high, contributing to low free testosterone.
    *   **Factors influencing SHBG:**
        *   Calorie restriction (CR) dramatically increases SHBG.
        *   Exercise increases SHBG, though to a lesser extent than CR.
        *   SHBG naturally increases with aging in the general population.
    *   **Conflicting associations:**
        *   Elevated SHBG is associated with increased incidence of Alzheimer's disease and metabolic syndrome.
        *   However, SHBG is also a component of biological age clocks, suggesting a role in longevity.
    *   **Interpretation:** The high SHBG is likely a result of vigorous exercise and potentially other factors like CR or aging. The interpretation of its health impact is complex due to these opposing associations.
    *   **Alternative perspective:** It has been suggested that low free testosterone due to high SHBG might indicate increased uptake by cells, which could be a positive sign, though this is difficult to measure directly.

## Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)

*   **DHT Trend:**
    *   DHT is moving towards a more optimal range, which is considered a positive development.
    *   This trend is being actively managed to maintain hair thickness.

## Estrogen and Precursors

*   **Estradiol and Total Estrogens:**
    *   Estradiol and total estrogens have been high at times.
    *   This is attributed to supplementation with pregnenolone and DHEA, which are upstream precursors to both testosterone and estrogen.
    *   It is noted that achieving higher testosterone often results in higher estrogen concurrently.
*   **Estrogen Metabolism Support:**
    *   Supplementation with calcium d-glucarate and DIM is being used to bind and aid in the elimination of estrogens.
    *   It's acknowledged that these agents bind to all estrogens, not selectively to specific types.
    *   17β-estradiol is considered beneficial for men.

## Other Markers

*   **Pregnenolone:** Mentioned as being present in the results.
*   **DHEA:** Mentioned as being supplemented and upstream of testosterone and estrogen.

## Future Actions and Considerations

*   Further research is needed to understand the specific risk associated with PSA doubling time and optimal target values for free PSA.
*   Investigate the potential genetic factors that may influence testosterone levels.
*   Explore the "longevitytools.com" biological age clock that incorporates SHBG.
*   Consider the complex implications of high SHBG and its potential benefits and risks.
