# 2023-12-31 Telomere Length Test 7 in 2023 - My Best Data Yet

## Executive Summary

*   The speaker's latest telomere length measurement (November 27, 2023) was 7.19 kilobases, representing the longest recorded length over 10 tests.
*   Telomere length significantly increased in 2023, averaging 7.14 kilobases over seven tests, compared to an average of 7.04 kilobases over three tests in 2022 (p < 0.05).
*   Telomere length naturally declines with age, dropping from approximately 7.75 kilobases in youth to around 5 kilobases in centenarians.
*   Calorie intake is significantly inversely correlated with telomere length, meaning higher calorie intake is associated with shorter telomeres.
*   Parmesan cheese intake also shows a significant inverse correlation with telomere length, even after adjusting for total calorie intake. Other dietary correlations (selenium, Vitamin B1, Brazil nuts, cacao beans, black pepper) observed in unadjusted analyses became non-significant after adjusting for calorie intake.

## Introduction to Telomeres and Aging

Telomere shortening is a hallmark of aging and negatively impacts other aspects of aging, including genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, and stem cell exhaustion. Telomere length decreases with age; leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in kilobases is approximately 7.75 kilobases in youth and declines to about 5 kilobases in centenarians.

## My Telomere Length Data (2022-2023)

The most recent telomere length measurement, from a test conducted on November 27, 2023, reported 7.19 kilobases (after correcting a minor rounding discrepancy from an initial 7.1 kilobases). This is the longest telomere length recorded over 10 tests, though it remains below youthful levels (7.75 kilobases).

Comparing telomere length between 2022 and 2023 reveals an improvement:
*   **2022:** Average telomere length was 7.04 kilobases over three tests.
*   **2023:** Average telomere length increased to 7.14 kilobases over seven tests.

A two-sample t-test confirmed this increase as statistically significant (p < 0.05), indicating a successful reversal of the age-related decline observed in the general population.

## Methodology for Dietary and Lifestyle Correlations

To identify factors impacting telomere length, detailed dietary intake was correlated with telomere length measurements.

**Dietary Tracking and Correlation Protocol:**
*   All food intake is tracked using a food scale.
*   Data is entered into Cronometer.
*   Data is then transferred to a spreadsheet for analysis.
*   Average dietary intake (including specific foods, macronutrients, and micronutrients) is calculated for the period between blood tests (e.g., 60 days).
*   This average dietary intake is correlated with the telomere length result of the *subsequent* blood test.
*   This process has been applied over 10 blood tests, allowing for 87 different dietary comparisons.

## Unadjusted Dietary Correlations with Telomere Length

Initial correlations between various dietary factors and telomere length (unadjusted for calorie intake) identified several significant associations (p < 0.05):

*   **Inverse Correlations:**
    *   **Parmesan cheese:** Higher intake correlated with shorter telomere length.
    *   **Cacao beans:** Higher intake correlated with shorter telomere length.
*   **Positive Correlations:**
    *   **Selenium:** Higher intake correlated with longer telomere length (majority sourced from Brazil nuts).
    *   **Vitamin B1:** Higher intake correlated with longer telomere length.
    *   **Ground black pepper:** Higher intake correlated with longer telomere length.

## Calorie Intake and Telomere Length

Calorie intake shows a significant inverse correlation with telomere length. A higher calorie intake is significantly associated with a shorter telomere length, and conversely, a lower calorie intake is significantly associated with a longer telomere length.

Extrapolating from current data, consistently reducing calorie intake from approximately 2,100 calories per day to around 2,050 calories per day may lead to consistently achieving telomere lengths closer to 7.2 kilobases in 2024. However, there is a lower limit to calorie reduction to avoid negatively impacting other biomarkers like muscle mass.

## Calorie-Adjusted Dietary Correlations

To determine if the observed dietary correlations were independent of calorie intake, adjustments were made:

*   **Parmesan Cheese:** Remained significantly inversely correlated with telomere length even after adjusting for calorie intake, suggesting an independent effect where higher intake is associated with shorter telomeres.
*   **Selenium, Vitamin B1, Brazil nuts, Cacao beans, Black pepper:** These dietary factors, which showed significant correlations in unadjusted analyses, became non-significant once adjusted for calorie intake. This indicates that their initial correlation was likely influenced by or mediated through overall calorie intake.

## Future Strategies for Telomere Length Optimization

Based on these findings, the plan for future telomere length optimization includes:
*   Further reducing Parmesan cheese intake.
*   Experimentally maintaining Brazil nut intake towards the higher end of the personal range.
*   Increasing black pepper intake (doubling from 1 gram to 2 grams) to test its direct impact.

These adjustments will be monitored with subsequent blood tests to evaluate their effect on telomere length.
