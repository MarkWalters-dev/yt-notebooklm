# 2025-01-12 Immunosenescence Inflammaging And Immune Resilience - Matt Yousefzadeh PhD

### Executive Summary

*   **Systemic Impact of Immune Cell Senescence:** Senescent immune cells, particularly those with DNA repair deficiency or mitochondrial dysfunction, can induce senescence in other solid organs, leading to premature aging phenotypes and systemic organ dysfunction (e.g., liver, kidney, intervertebral disc).
*   **Inflammaging Mechanism:** Cellular senescence leads to a Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) characterized by inflammatory factors (interleukins, chemokines). These factors contribute to "inflammaging," a low-grade chronic sterile inflammation that drives age-related diseases and can exacerbate responses to infection.
*   **Immune Resilience Interventions:** Lifestyle interventions like caloric restriction (even 12-14% reduction) and progressive resistance exercise improve thymic function, reduce epigenetic aging, decrease circulating SASP factors, and improve physical function in humans.
*   **Rapamycin as a Gerotherapeutic:** Rapamycin significantly rejuvenates old hematopoietic stem cells in mice, increases resistance to influenza, and improves annual influenza vaccine antibody titers by 20% in elderly humans, while reducing immune dysfunction markers (PD-1) on T-cells.
*   **Biomarker Panel for Immune Health:** A robust panel for monitoring immune aging could include systemic GDF-15, basic immune cell ratios (CD4:CD8, naive T-cells), epigenetic clocks (e.g., Dunedin Pace), and functional assays like vaccination titer levels.

## Introduction to Immune Aging

The immune system is crucial for healthy aging. As individuals age, their bodies respond less efficiently to vaccinations, become more prone to infections (e.g., influenza, sepsis), and experience a general decline in immune function. The immune system circulates throughout the body, making it sensitive to systemic changes and a valuable readout for overall health, underpinning the basis of epigenetic clocks.

The immune system comprises two main branches:
*   **Innate Immune System:** Rapidly responding, non-specific defense against infections (bacterial/viral). It relies on phagocytosis (eating foreign substances) by antigen-presenting cells (APCs).
*   **Adaptive Immune System:** Highly specific, slower-acting response. APCs present antigens to T-cells, leading to B-cell antibody production.

Both systems are affected by aging, leading to a process known as immunosenescence.

## Immunosenescence and Inflammaging

Immunosenescence is the progressive, age-related decline in immune function. Hallmarks include:
*   Lymphoidal atrophy and thymic involution
*   Decreased antigen responses
*   Mitochondrial dysfunction
*   Myeloid skewing (imbalance in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation)
*   Loss of naive immune cells
*   Increased inflammation

All immune cell types—hematopoietic stem cells, innate immune cells, and adaptive immune cells—are affected by aging. These changes are often linked to molecular pathways involved in the broader aging process, particularly cellular senescence.

## Cellular Senescence and SASP (Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype)

Cellular senescence is a state where damaged or stressed cells undergo a stable cell cycle arrest, preventing proliferation. While this can prevent cancer, senescent cells remain metabolically active and acquire a **Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP)**.

**Process of Cellular Senescence and SASP:**
Healthy, young individual (under stress) -> Damaged/stressed cell -> Cell fate decision:
1.  Apoptosis (programmed cell death)
2.  Transformation (becomes cancer cell)
3.  Cellular Senescence (stable cell cycle arrest, no proliferation) -> Releases SASP factors (interleukins, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases) -> Damages adjacent tissues, induces secondary senescence, acts systemically (endocrine-like).

Senescent cells exhibit heterogeneous features including morphological changes, metabolic alterations, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, resistance to apoptosis, and epigenetic alterations. The SASP contributes significantly to "inflammaging"—a low-grade, chronic, sterile inflammation that increases with age. This chronic inflammation drives age-related diseases and can lead to cytokine storms in response to challenges like infection.

Other factors influencing immune aging include:
*   **Gut Dysbiosis:** Age-related changes in gut flora and increased gut leakiness can lead to the systemic presence of commensal bacteria and their metabolites, profoundly impacting immune cells.
*   **Social Determinants of Health:** Chronic stress, social stress, income, and housing levels are linked to immune changes.
*   **Sex-Based Differences:** Significant differences exist between males and females in vaccination efficacy and immune responses, sometimes overshadowing age-related changes.

## Systemic Impact of Immune Cell Senescence (Mouse Data)

Senescent cells accumulate with age due to increased production and decreased clearance by the immune system. Immune cells themselves can become senescent.

**Mechanism of Systemic Aging from Immune Cells:**
Normal Immune Cell (e.g., T-cell) -> DNA repair deficiency OR mitochondrial maintenance protein removal OR natural aging -> Senescent Immune Cell -> Secretory Phenotype (SASP) -> Secondary Senescence (in other immune cells, epithelial cells, solid organs) -> Systemic Age.

This creates a vicious cycle where senescent immune cells contribute to systemic "trash" buildup while simultaneously losing their ability to clear it.

### Mouse Model: DNA Repair Deficiency in Immune Cells
To study the impact of immune cell senescence, researchers created a mouse model:
*   **Methodology:**
    1.  A DNA repair gene (ERCC1) was selectively removed from hematopoietic (immune) cells of mice.
    2.  A functional ERCC1 copy was maintained in the rest of the mouse.
    3.  Control mice had normal ERCC1.
*   **Findings:**
    *   Mutant mice showed a gradual loss of white blood cells (lymphopenia) over time, indicating a degenerative rather than developmental phenotype.
    *   At an early age (3 months), no increase in senescence was observed in immune organs (spleen, bone marrow).
    *   At 8 months, spleens of mutant mice showed increased expression of senescence-related genes (p16, p21) and SASP factors (MCP1, IL-6), comparable to naturally aged 2-year-old mice.
    *   **Immune Dysfunction:** At 5 months, mutant mice exhibited:
        *   Significantly decreased footpad swelling in response to antigen challenge (like a TB test).
        *   Reduced antibody production against the antigen.
        *   Impaired natural killer (NK) cell killing of target cells (NK cells are important for clearing senescent cells).
    *   **Solid Organ Senescence and Dysfunction:** After the onset of immune senescence, solid organs also developed senescence and dysfunction.
        *   Increased senescent cells (p16 marker) were found in liver, kidney, and intervertebral discs.
        *   Liver damage markers (ALT, AST) increased.
        *   Proteinuria (protein in urine), indicative of kidney dysfunction, increased.
        *   Reduction in glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in intervertebral discs, leading to disc thinning.
        *   Impaired muscle regeneration after cardiotoxin challenge, with altered macrophage ratios.

### Mouse Model: Mitochondrial Dysfunction in T-cells
Another study showed that deleting the mitochondrial protein Tfam (a transcription factor vital for mitochondrial DNA structure) specifically in T-cells caused similar premature aging:
*   **Findings:** T-cells exhibited immune dysfunction features, increased exhausted T-cell transcription factors, and elevated p21 and senescence markers in various tissues, ultimately leading to shortened lifespan. This highlighted that mitochondrial dysfunction in T-cells alone is sufficient to drive a strong premature aging phenotype in solid organs.

## Measuring Immune Resilience

Immune resilience refers to the ability to restore immune function, promote disease resistance, and control inflammation during stress (e.g., infection).

**Methods for Measuring Immune Resilience:**
*   **Immune Cell Population Surveys:** Analyze T-cells, B-cells, naive T-cells, etc.
*   **Transcriptional Profiling (e.g., RNA-seq):** Provides detailed molecular changes but may be too complex for large-scale studies (e.g., David Furman's Thousand Immunomes Project). This can generate "immune health grades."
*   **Functional Assays:**
    *   *In vitro* stimulation of T-cells to assess response.
    *   Measurement of NK cell cytotoxicity.
    *   Macrophage phagocytosis assays.
*   **Vaccination Responses:** Monitor antibody titer levels after annual influenza vaccination. This is a practical and robust measure of immune function and memory.

## Strategies to Rejuvenate the Immune System

### Lifestyle Interventions
*   **Caloric Restriction (CR):**
    *   **Mouse Data:** CR consistently extends lifespan and improves health in animal models.
    *   **Human Data (CALERIE Study):** Healthy, non-obese individuals underwent ~12-14% caloric restriction for two years.
        *   Improved thymic function.
        *   Reduced epigenetic clock (slower biological aging).
        *   Decreased circulating SASP factors.
*   **Exercise:** Progressive resistance training in healthy elderly individuals improved physical function, reduced circulating SASP, and decreased p16 expression in peripheral blood T-cells.
*   **Fiber Supplementation:** Soluble fiber may improve gut function, alleviate gut leakiness, and potentially enhance immune responses (e.g., improved survival after influenza infection in animal models).

### Pharmacological Interventions
*   **Metformin:** May reduce some forms of immunosenescence, particularly in mouse models, with some human data.
*   **Rapamycin:** A gold-standard gerotherapeutic.
    *   **Mouse Data:**
        *   Increases lifespan by inhibiting mTOR.
        *   Late-life intervention is effective.
        *   Reduces systemic inflammation and cardiac pathology.
        *   Rejuvenates old hematopoietic stem cells.
        *   Increases resistance to influenza challenge and survival in old mice.
    *   **Human Data (Novartis Study):** Short-course rapamycin in elderly individuals:
        *   Increased annual influenza antibody titers by 20%.
        *   Reduced PD-1 (an immune dysfunction marker) on CD4 and CD8 T-cells.
    *   **Immunosenescence Model (Mouse):** Treatment of DNA repair-deficient mice with rapamycin improved immune function (e.g., footpad swelling deficit).
    *   **Ongoing Research:** Single-nuclei RNA-seq studies are investigating which immune cell types are rejuvenated by rapamycin (e.g., shifting aged populations back to a younger profile, reducing exhausted T-cells).
*   **NAD+ Supplementation:** In mice, this has benefited dysfunctional and aged immune cells.
*   **Mitophagy Activators (e.g., Urolithin A):** Shown to rejuvenate old hematopoietic stem cells in mice.
*   **SGLT2 Inhibitors (e.g., Canagliflozin):** May increase immune surveillance.

### Biological and Cell-Based Interventions
*   **PD-1 Inhibitors:** Used in cancer treatment, also shown to have immune benefits in mice.
*   **Targeting Myeloid-Biased Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs):** With age, HSCs can shift from producing lymphocytes (lymphopoiesis) to more granulocytes (myeloid skewing), contributing to inflammation. Targeting these biased HSCs is beneficial in mice.
*   **Stem Cell Transplantation / Thymic Progenitors.**
*   **CAR T-cells:** Programmed to target senescent cells expressing uPAR (urokinase plasminogen activator receptor).
    *   **Mouse Data (Karina Moore & Scott Lowe's lab):** Senolytic CAR T-cells effectively improve health in mice with a durable effect from a single infusion, potentially even rejuvenating the gut.

## Biomarkers of Immune Aging

Identifying robust biomarkers is crucial for monitoring immune health and the efficacy of interventions.

**Potential Biomarkers:**
*   **CBC with Differentials:** While basic, increased granularity beyond total white blood cell counts is needed.
*   **Flow Cytometry Panels:**
    *   Ratios of lymphocytes (CD4, CD8 T-cells, B-cells) and naive T-cells.
    *   Expression of p16 in peripheral blood T-cells (a surrogate biomarker for biological aging). This has been shown to predict frailty and hospital stay length in liver transplant patients.
    *   PD-1 expression on T-cells (marker of immune dysfunction).
*   **SASP Factors:**
    *   **Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and TNF-alpha:** Clinically available, but highly sensitive to acute inflammation (e.g., a common cold).
    *   **Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF-15):** A systemic marker, increasing with biological aging and disease. In healthy individuals with few chronic diseases, it predicts risk of death. (Currently research use only, not commercially available).
*   **Immunoglobulins (IgG):** Levels increase with age. High IgG may indicate microbial burden or loss of immune tolerance, potentially contributing to autoimmune conditions.
*   **Epigenetic Clocks:** While functional relevance is still being studied, clocks like Dunedin Pace provide a "speedometer" for aging.
*   **Functional Assays:** Ex vivo stimulation of immune cells with novel antigens.
*   **Vaccination Titer Levels:** Response to annual influenza vaccination.

**Challenges and Future Directions for Biomarkers:**
*   Need for more specific compounds that selectively target immune cells.
*   Developing better, more granular biomarkers that are both informative and accessible/affordable.
*   Comprehensive, integrated studies of multiple hallmarks of aging simultaneously (e.g., senescence, autophagy, DNA damage) within the immune system longitudinally.
*   Studying outliers (progeria patients, centenarians) to understand the extremes of immune aging.
*   Moving towards "precision immunotherapeutics" by identifying specific root causes of immune dysfunction (e.g., viral infections, gut dysbiosis, specific senescent cell types) and tailoring interventions.
*   Further research into the precise mechanisms by which widely beneficial interventions (e.g., calorie restriction, rapamycin) impact the immune system, distinguishing direct immune effects from systemic benefits that secondarily improve immune function.
