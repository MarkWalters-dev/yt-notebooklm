# 2025-09-07 Diet Supplements Of A Longevity Scientist Blood Test 5 In 2025

## Executive Summary
*   Biological age is 16.5 years younger than chronological age, as measured by the PhenoAge calculator.
*   Optimal free T3 levels (3.3-4.2 pg/mL) are associated with the best survival rates, prompting adjustments to thyroid hormone medication to achieve these levels.
*   Supplementation with NMN was stopped at least a month prior to the blood test due to its potential impact on NAD levels, which were observed to be at a three-year low.
*   Increased riboflavin intake (6.6 mg/day, 6x RDA) is being explored for its role as a cofactor in the folate cycle, potentially improving MTHFR activity and homocysteine reduction.
*   Avocado intake shows a significant inverse correlation with lipoprotein A levels, suggesting its potential benefit in managing this cardiovascular risk marker.

## Prescription Medications
*   **Hypothyroidism Treatment:**
    *   Levothyroxine: 75 micrograms per day
    *   Cytomel: 20 micrograms per day
    *   **Goal:** Achieve free T3 (FT3) levels greater than or equal to 3.3 pg/mL.
*   **FT3 and Survival:**
    *   Optimal survival rates are associated with FT3 levels between 3.3 and 4.2 pg/mL.
    *   Lower FT3 levels (2.3-2.8 pg/mL) are associated with the worst survival.
    *   Recent medication adjustments have aimed to bring FT3 levels into the optimal range.

## Supplements
*   **Vitamin D:**
    *   Previously supplemented with 2,000 IU per day.
    *   Supplementation was paused for approximately half of the 56-day period preceding this test.
    *   The pause was due to increased full-body sun exposure (20 minutes daily) after relocating to Austin, Texas.
    *   Circulating vitamin D levels will be monitored in subsequent tests to assess the impact of sun exposure.
*   **Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN):**
    *   Dosage: 2,000-2,100 mg per day.
    *   **Purpose:** To test subjective improvements and sleep quality.
    *   **Note:** NMN was taken only from June 5th to June 10th, at least a month prior to the July 22nd test, with no other NAD precursors taken for 51 of the 56 days.
    *   **Associated Observation:** Intracellular NAD levels were at a three-year low (14.8 µmol/L) on the test day, suggesting NAD precursors may be essential.
    *   **Nicotinic Acid:** Removed from supplementation due to correlation with lower lymphocyte counts.
*   **B Vitamins (for Homocysteine):**
    *   **Stack:** Methyl B12 (1,000 µg), Methylfolate (400 µg), Vitamin B6 (1.5 mg).
    *   **Duration:** Taken for 54 of the 56 days.
    *   **Impact:** Minor impact on homocysteine levels, historically correlated with a ~10% reduction.
*   **Riboflavin (Vitamin B2):**
    *   **Current Intake:** 6.6 mg per day (6x RDA).
    *   **Goal:** Gradually increase intake towards 30 mg per day, potentially splitting doses to reach 60 mg per day.
    *   **Rationale:** Riboflavin is a required cofactor for MTHFR protein activity in the folate cycle, which is involved in homocysteine reduction. Suboptimal riboflavin can impair MTHFR activity.
    *   **Additional Rationale:** Published data suggests cells with higher rejuvenation capacity have higher riboflavin levels, suggesting potential long-term benefits even if homocysteine reduction is not directly observed.
*   **Zinc:**
    *   **Current Intake:** 15 mg per day (zinc glycinate).
    *   **Rationale:** Zinc is a cofactor for betaine methyltransferase, an enzyme involved in homocysteine reduction. Optimal zinc status is considered important for this pathway.
    *   **Optimal Range Consideration:** The Linus Pauling Institute recommends up to 40 mg per day.
    *   **Potential Long-Term Benefit:** May be retained for its role in immunity, inflammation reduction in aged animals, and potential impact on other biomarkers, even if direct homocysteine reduction is not achieved.
*   **Betaine (Trimethylglycine):**
    *   **Supplementation:** Approximately 1.5 g per day (for test #6).
    *   **Previous Intake:** Up to 4 g per day without significant impact on homocysteine.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Previous lack of response may have been due to suboptimal zinc status, affecting betaine methyltransferase activity. This will be re-evaluated with concurrent zinc supplementation.
*   **Brazil Nuts:**
    *   **Increased Intake:** From 7 to 11 grams per day.
    *   **Rationale:** Significant correlation with lower Candida IgG in personal data. High Candida IgG suggests the immune system is working harder to control systemic Candida.
    *   **Selenium:** Brazil nuts are a primary source of selenium, which is being increased in correlation with Candida IgG.
*   **Olives:**
    *   **Increased Intake:** From 36 to 44 grams per day (currently averaging 75 g/day for test #6).
    *   **Rationale:** Exploring the hypothesis of whole food (olives) versus processed food (olive oil) for optimal health. Monitoring biomarker changes with increased olive intake.
*   **Nutmeg:**
    *   **Inclusion:** Small amounts consumed in the days prior to testing.
    *   **Rationale:** Contains nectandrin B, a metabolite shown in studies to significantly extend maximal lifespan in fruit flies (Drosophila) and prevent cellular senescence in fibroblasts.
    *   **Consideration:** Further research is needed to determine optimal dosage, but inclusion is based on potential longevity benefits observed in model organisms.

## Diet
*   **Average Daily Dietary Intake (May 27th - July 21st, 2025):**
    *   54 different foods consumed.
    *   Food weighing and tracking via Chronometer app.
*   **Ranking Exceptions:**
    *   Green Tea: Ranked in ounces (daily staple).
    *   Ice Cream and Cookies: Ranked in calories per day (consumed on only two specific days within the 56-day period).
*   **Experiments for Optimizing Biomarkers:**
    *   **Homocysteine:** Added beets and amaranth back into the diet. These are rich in betaine, but the dietary contribution (approx. 200 mg) was insufficient for a major impact.
    *   **Cystatin C:** Added broccoli back into the diet.
        *   **Observation:** Cystatin C levels have increased from 0.72 mg/L to 0.87 mg/L, moving in the wrong direction.
        *   **Hypothesis:** The correlation of higher cystatin C with saturated fat intake may be a contributing factor, requiring further investigation.
    *   **Lipoprotein A:** Increased avocado intake.
        *   **Observation:** A significant inverse correlation exists between average daily avocado intake and lipoprotein A levels. Higher avocado intake is correlated with lower lipoprotein A.
        *   **Current Status:** Lipoprotein A remains on the higher side (91 nmol/L), and further strategies to lower it are being explored, despite low hs-CRP and apo B.
    *   **Indoxyl Sulfate & DHEA Sulfate:** Doubled coconut butter intake.
        *   **Hypothesis:** Intended to reduce indoxyl sulfate (gut bacteria metabolite) and potentially increase DHEA sulfate, based on inverse correlations.
        *   **Outcome:** The hypothesis did not materialize, and coconut butter intake has since been reduced.
*   **Cheat Meals:**
    *   Implemented for up to two days immediately following blood testing.
    *   **Purpose:** To prevent long-term restriction leading to binge eating.
    *   **Foods Consumed:** Klondike Reese's ice cream bars, double chocolate cookie ice cream sandwich, Loft's Gram Cookies, chocolate chips mixed with peanut butter, sugar added to homemade chocolate mix.
    *   **Total Junk Calories:** Approximately 2,500 calories over three days, representing ~1.9% of total calories for the 56-day period.
*   **Top 10 Foods by Average Daily Calorie Intake:**
    1.  Sardines
    2.  Walnuts
    3.  Avocado
    4.  Blueberries

    *   **Protein:** 96 g (17% of total calories)
    *   **Fat:** 99 g (39% of total calories)

        *   Total Fructose Intake: 62 g per day (progress from previous higher intake).
*   **Micronutrients:**
    *   **Vitamins:** Full RDA coverage for all vitamins. Many vitamins are intentionally higher than RDA based on correlations with ~30 biomarkers (e.g., Vitamin K at 23x RDA, Vitamin C at 873 mg). Riboflavin intake is lower than in previous tests to approach physiological levels. Vitamin D intake was halved due to increased sun exposure.
    *   **Minerals:**
        *   Selenium: Increased due to Brazil nut intake.
        *   Sodium: Increased intake initiated (current test data showing higher direction, ~2,500 mg/day for test #6).
        *   Zinc: Supplementation with 15 mg/day initiated.
