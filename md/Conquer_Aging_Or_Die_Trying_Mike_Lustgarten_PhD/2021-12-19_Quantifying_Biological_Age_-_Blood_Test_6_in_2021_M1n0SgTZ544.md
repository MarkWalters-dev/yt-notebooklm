# 2021-12-19 Quantifying Biological Age - Blood Test 6 in 2021

## Executive Summary
*   The author's biological age, measured by the Levine phenotypic age calculator, is 36.9 years, which is 12 years younger than their chronological age.
*   Across six blood tests in 2021 using the Levine calculator, the average biological age was 35.6 years, which is statistically similar to the average of 35.6 years from six tests in 2020.
*   Using the aging.ai 3.0 model with 19 blood biomarkers, the author's biological age is 29 years, nearly 20 years younger than their chronological age.
*   Since implementing diet tracking and regular interventions in 2016, the author's average aging.ai age has been 29.9 years, generally ranging between 28 and 31 years old.
*   The author notes that aging.ai does not include chronological age in its model, potentially allowing for greater reductions in biological age compared to models that do.

## Biological Age Metrics and Results

### Levine Phenotypic Age Calculator

*   **Most Recent Test (2021-12-19):** Biological age of 36.9 years.
*   **2021 Data (Six Tests):**
    *   Lowest: 32.7 years
    *   Highest: 37.1 years
    *   Average: 35.6 years
*   **2020 Data (Six Tests):**
    *   Lowest: 33.5 years
    *   Highest: 39.8 years
    *   Average: 35.6 years
*   **Comparison (2020 vs. 2021):** A two-sample t-test indicated no statistically significant difference between the two years' data, suggesting biological age stability at an average of 35.6 years over 12 tests.
*   **2018-2019 Data (Three Tests):** Average biological age of 36.1 years.

**Note:** The Levine model automatically increases biological age by 0.9 years for every 1-year increase in chronological age, even if all biomarkers remain constant.

### Aging.ai 3.0

*   **Current Test (2021):** Biological age of 29 years (19.9 years younger than chronological age).
*   **Data Collection Start:** 2009.
*   **Diet Tracking and Intervention Implementation:** 2015 onwards.
*   **Aging.ai Data (Since 2016, with Diet Tracking and Interventions):**
    *   **2016 (2 tests):** Average age of 28 years.
    *   **2017 (4 tests):** Average age of 29.3 years.
    *   **2018 (6 tests):** Average age of 29.5 years.
    *   **2019 (3 tests):** Average age of 30.3 years.
    *   **2020 (6 tests):** Average age of 31.3 years.
    *   **2021 (6 tests):** Average age of 29.8 years.
*   **Overall Average (Since 2016):** 29.9 years.
*   **Range (Since 2016):** Generally maintained between 28 and 31 years old.
*   **Pre-Diet Tracking Data (2009-2013, 3 tests):** Average age of 32 years.

**Note:** C-reactive protein (CRP) is a biomarker required for some aging.ai calculations but is not part of a standard yearly physical. The author began measuring CRP in 2018. Aging.ai 3.0 does not require CRP.

## Methodology and Observations

*   The author regularly undergoes blood testing to track and optimize well-established biomarkers of organ and systemic health, with the goal of slowing aging and disease risk.
*   Interventions are based on correlations found between diet and blood biomarkers.
*   The author trusts data from a larger number of blood tests (12) over a smaller number (3) for biological age assessment.
