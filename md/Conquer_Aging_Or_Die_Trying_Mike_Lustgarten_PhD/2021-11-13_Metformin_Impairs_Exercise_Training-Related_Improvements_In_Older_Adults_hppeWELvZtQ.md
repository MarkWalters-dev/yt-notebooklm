# 2021-11-13 Metformin Impairs Exercise Training-Related Improvements In Older Adults

## Executive Summary

*   Metformin significantly increases myostatin gene expression (up to 150-fold) and protein levels in C2C12 muscle cells, a known inhibitor of muscle growth.
*   In young C57BL/6J mice, metformin treatment for four weeks increased myostatin gene expression by 50%, decreased average muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and reduced grip strength.
*   In older adults undergoing 14 weeks of progressive resistance training, metformin (1700 mg/day) blunted improvements in whole-body lean mass and thigh muscle mass, and showed trends for less improvement in knee extension strength and power compared to placebo.
*   In older obese older adults undergoing 12 weeks of aerobic exercise training, metformin (up to 2000 mg/day) impaired whole-body insulin sensitivity improvements and showed a trend for lesser VO2 max gains compared to placebo.
*   Metformin did not provide additional improvements in fasting glucose or insulin sensitivity in strength-trained older adults compared to placebo, despite its known glucose-lowering effects.

## Cellular Data

Metformin's impact on muscle cells was investigated using in vitro assays with C2C12 muscle cells.

*   **Myostatin Gene Expression:** In the presence of metformin, myostatin gene (mRNA) expression dramatically increased by almost 150-fold compared to its absence.
*   **Myostatin Protein Levels:** As metformin concentrations were increased up to two millimolar, myostatin protein levels correspondingly increased.

These data suggest that metformin may negatively affect muscle health, partly by increasing myostatin levels. Myostatin is a crucial regulator of muscle mass; animals without myostatin exhibit dramatically increased muscle mass in both the upper arm and leg.

**Myostatin Pathway:**
Metformin -> Increased Myostatin Gene Expression -> Increased Myostatin Protein -> Decreased Muscle Mass

## Mouse Data

To further investigate metformin's effects, a study was conducted on young mice.

*   **Protocol:**
    *   Seven-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (equivalent to approximately five human years) were used.
    *   Mice were injected with metformin or saline (control) three times a week for four weeks.

*   **Myostatin Expression:** Metformin treatment significantly increased myostatin gene expression by approximately 50% in the supplemented animals compared to controls.
*   **Muscle Mass:** Metformin-treated mice exhibited a significantly smaller muscle fiber cross-sectional area compared to controls.
*   **Muscle Function:** At the end of the four-week study, metformin-injected mice showed significantly reduced grip strength compared to saline-injected controls.

**Summary of Mouse Data:** Metformin induces myostatin gene expression, decreases muscle cross-sectional area, and reduces grip strength in young mice.

## Human Evidence: Resistance Training

A randomized controlled trial investigated metformin supplementation in older adults undergoing a 14-week strength training program.

*   **Subject Population:**
    *   94 total subjects.
    *   Overweight (average BMI > 25 kg/m²).
    *   Average age: 69 years old.
    *   At risk for mobility disability.
*   **Metformin Dose:** 1700 milligrams per day.

*   **Lean Mass:**
    *   The placebo group showed significant increases in whole-body lean mass (measured by DEXA).
    *   The metformin group showed less improvement in whole-body lean mass.
    *   The improvement in whole-body lean mass was significantly greater for the placebo group compared to the metformin-supplemented group (p=0.03).
    *   When specifically looking at thigh muscle mass (percentage), the placebo-supplemented older adults had a far greater improvement compared to metformin-supplemented older adults (statistically significant difference).

*   **Muscle Function (Strength and Power):**
    *   Strength was assessed using three measures of knee extension: one-repetition maximum (1RM), maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), and knee extension power.
    *   **Knee Extension 1RM:** The metformin group improved approximately 8% less than the placebo group (p=0.055, very close to statistical significance).
    *   **Knee Extension MVIC:** The metformin group improved approximately 5% less than the placebo group (p=0.08, close to statistical significance).
    *   **Knee Extension Power:** The metformin group improved about half as much as the placebo-treated group (p=0.064, close to statistical significance).
    *   **Caveat:** Baseline strength and power measurements in the metformin-treated group were significantly higher than in the placebo group, which might have influenced the observed differences in improvements.

*   **Glucose and Insulin Sensitivity:**
    *   Both groups improved their fasting glucose levels and insulin sensitivity index (derived from an oral glucose tolerance test) as a result of the strength training program.
    *   However, the metformin-treated group did not show any further improvement in fasting glucose levels or insulin sensitivity compared to the placebo group.

## Human Evidence: Aerobic Training

A second randomized controlled trial involved obese older adults undergoing 12 weeks of aerobic exercise training.

*   **Subject Population:**
    *   53 subjects.
    *   Obese (average BMI > 30 kg/m²).
    *   Average age: 62-63 years old.
*   **Metformin Dosing Protocol:**
    *   **Week 1:** 500 mg/day
    *   **Week 2:** 1000 mg/day
    *   **Week 3:** 1500 mg/day
    *   **Week 4 and onwards (until 12 weeks):** 2000 mg/day (or 1500 mg/day for individuals weighing less than 75 kg).

*   **Whole-Body Insulin Sensitivity:** The placebo group significantly improved their whole-body insulin sensitivity more than the metformin-treated group. This suggests that metformin impairs aerobic exercise-induced improvements in insulin sensitivity.
*   **VO2 Max:** A statistically significant trend was observed where the metformin group improved their VO2 max less than the placebo-treated group as a result of the aerobic exercise training (p=0.08).

## Conclusion

Considering both randomized controlled trials in older adults:

*   **At best,** metformin does not provide additional benefits in improving insulin sensitivity or physical function in exercise-trained older adults.
*   **At worst,** metformin impairs insulin sensitivity and reduces gains in muscle mass and physical function (strength, power, and VO2 max) in exercise-trained older adults.
