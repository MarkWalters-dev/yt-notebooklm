# 2025-11-09 Diet Composition That Corresponds To A 17y Younger Biological Age Test 6 In 2025 Deep Dive

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age was measured as 17 years younger than chronological age (Fage clock) for blood test #6 in September 2025.
*   Reduction of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) from coconut butter and cacao beans correlated with a decrease in Cystatin C, a biomarker for kidney function and epigenetic aging.
*   Lowering fructose intake (from strawberries and blueberries) was associated with a reduction in RDW, a blood marker that had been trending upwards.
*   High dietary intake of various carotenoids (alpha/beta carotene, beta cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein, zeaxanthin) is consistently associated with a younger biological age according to Fage.
*   An intervention to lower total fat and increase net carbohydrates (primarily corn, chickpeas, oats) did not result in a reduction of HbA1c, which remained at 5.4%.

## Diet Tracking Methodology

For the 56-day period between blood test #5 (July 22nd) and blood test #6 (September 15th), all dietary intake was meticulously tracked.
*   All foods were weighed using a food scale.
*   Data was entered into Chronometer for analysis.
*   Dietary intake was primarily ranked by grams, with two exceptions:
    *   Cheesecake intake was tracked in calories, representing one day's consumption over the 56-day period.
    *   Green tea was measured in ounces.

## Interventions and Biomarker Optimization

For blood test #6, three main interventions were implemented to optimize specific biomarkers.

### 1. Cystatin C Reduction

Cystatin C is a biomarker for kidney function and a significant contributor to epigenetic aging (specifically for GrimAge). Optimal levels are considered less than 0.7 mg/L, and it typically increases with age. The participant's Cystatin C had increased over the five preceding tests, showing a strong linear correlation with chronological age (R = 0.94, P < 0.05).

**Intervention Goal:** Reduce Cystatin C.

**Action:**
*   **Reduced Saturated Fatty Acid (SFA) containing foods:**
    *   Coconut butter: Cut from an average of 26 g/day to ~3 g/day.
    *   Cacao beans: Cut from an average of 10 g/day to ~1 g/day.

**Correlations Supporting Intervention (prior to Test #6):**
*   **Macros/Micros:** Calories, lycopene, and saturated fatty acids were all positively and significantly correlated with higher Cystatin C. Body weight was significantly correlated with lower Cystatin C.
*   **Foods:** While not statistically significant (P < 0.05), cacao beans and coconut butter showed positive correlations with Cystatin C. Watermelon and tomatoes (major sources of lycopene) also showed positive correlations, though not statistically significant.

**Impact on Cystatin C:**
*   Following the reduction in SFAs, Cystatin C decreased, reaching 0.75 mg/L, which was close to the best previous reading and lower than the preceding five tests.
*   This outcome suggests a potential causative link, though natural variability cannot be ruled out.

**Evolution of Correlations (after Test #6):**
*   **Saturated Fatty Acids:** Correlation strengthened from R=0.82 to R=0.84, suggesting a real correlation.
*   **Lycopene:** Correlation weakened from R=0.89 to R=0.78, suggesting it may not be a primary factor in Cystatin C changes.
*   **Calorie Intake:** Correlation weakened dramatically from R=0.91 to R=0.63, suggesting it may not be a major factor for Cystatin C.
*   **Cacao Beans:** Correlation remained strong (R=0.72 to R=0.74).
*   **Coconut Butter:** Correlation strengthened (R=0.61 to R=0.67).
*   **Bananas:** Correlation weakened significantly (R=-0.9 to R=-0.68), suggesting less relevance to Cystatin C.

**Future Interventions for Cystatin C:**
*   Lower blueberry intake (due to positive correlation with higher Cystatin C).
*   Increase cinnamon intake (due to significant inverse correlation with Cystatin C).

### 2. RDW (Red Cell Distribution Width) Reduction

RDW had consistently increased over five consecutive tests.

**Intervention Goal:** Lower RDW.

**Action:**
*   **Reduced Fructose Intake:**
    *   Identified fructose intake (correlation coefficient R=0.74, P < 0.05) as a strong positive correlate for higher RDW.
    *   Reduced strawberry intake.
    *   Reduced blueberry intake.

**Impact on RDW:**
*   RDW decreased from 12.3 (after July test) to 12.1 (after September test).
*   This suggests a possible link between fructose reduction and lower RDW, though natural variability is acknowledged.

**Future Interventions for RDW:**
*   Further cut fructose intake by approximately 7 g/day to around 50 g/day for the next test to observe further impact on RDW.

### 3. HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c) Optimization

HbA1c had consistently been 5.3-5.4% for five consecutive tests, with a goal to keep it closer to 5.0%.

**Intervention Goal:** Lower HbA1c.

**Action:**
*   **Reduced Total Fat Intake:**
    *   Identified total fat (correlation coefficient R=0.61, P < 0.05) as a positive correlate for higher total glucose.
    *   Cut total fat from an average of 99 g/day to 84 g/day.
    *   Specific fat reductions included: coconut butter, cacao beans, and walnuts (from ~10 g/day to ~3 g/day).
*   **Increased Net Carbohydrate Intake (to remain eucaloric):**
    *   Increased corn.
    *   Increased chickpeas.
    *   Increased oats (smaller increase).

**Impact on HbA1c:**
*   HbA1c remained unchanged at 5.4%. The intervention did not achieve the desired effect.

**Future Interventions for HbA1c:**
*   Investigate the impact of cinnamon, which also shows correlations with HbA1c.

## Diet Composition Details

The average daily dietary intake spanned 56 days between blood tests.

### Cheat Meal Strategy

*   The participant's strategy involves consuming "junk" foods immediately after a blood test to prevent binging and maintain motivation for a nutrient-dense diet.
*   **Post-Test #5 Cheat Meals:**
    *   Day 1: Cheesecake (~1,300 calories).
    *   Day 2: Peanut butter mixed with chocolate (~550 calories).
    *   No other "junk" for the remaining 54 days.
*   **Total "Junk" Calories:** ~1,900 calories over 56 days, representing 1.5% of total calories (98.5% "clean" diet).

### Top 10 Foods by Average Daily Calorie Intake

For this 56-day period, the top 10 foods contributing to daily calorie intake included:
1.  Strawberries (primary calorie source, chosen for ficetin content and positive biomarker correlations).
2.  Corn (new to top 10).
3.  Green Olives (increased intake to ~70 g/day as an experimental variable for biomarker correlations; diet contains no oils).
4.  Non- or Low-Fat Yogurt (new to top 10).
5.  *Seven of the top 10 foods remained consistent with Test #5.*

*Foods that left the top 10 but were still consumed:* Coconut butter, avocado, blueberries.

### Macronutrient Profile (Average Daily Intake)

*   **Total Calories:** 2,274 kcal/day (similar to Test #5 at ~2,300 kcal/day).
*   **Protein:** 113 g/day (20% of total calories, an increase of ~3% from Test #5's 16.7%).
*   **Fat:** 84 g/day (33% of total calories, a purposeful reduction from 99 g/day in Test #5).
    *   Majority from saturated fat (coconut butter, cacao beans) and omega-6 (walnuts).
    *   Includes monounsaturated and omega-3 fats.
*   **Carbohydrates:**
    *   Total Carbs: 312 g/day.
    *   Fiber: 87 g/day.
    *   Net Carbs: 225 g/day (40% of total calories).

**Fiber's Caloric Contribution:**
Soluble fiber (approximately 20% of total fiber) is fermented by gut bacteria into short-chain fatty acids, contributing calories.
Fiber -> Gut Bacteria Fermentation -> Short-Chain Fatty Acids
Chronometer estimated ~164 calories from fiber fermentation, or 7% of total diet.

**Adjusted Net Macronutrient Profile:**
*   **Total Fat:** ~41% (including calories from fiber fermentation)
*   **Net Carbs:** ~40%
*   **Protein:** ~20%

**Fructose Intake:**
*   Total fructose: 57 g/day (a ~5 g/day reduction from Test #5, potentially contributing to lower RDW).
*   This is significantly lower than the highest recorded fructose intake of 122 g/day. A further reduction to ~50 g/day is planned for the next test.

### Micronutrient Profile

**General Vitamin Coverage:**
*   Full RDA coverage was achieved for almost all vitamins.
*   **Choline:** Appears lower than the 500 mg/day RDA due to Chronometer's data limitations for the specific sardine brand used, but actual intake is likely sufficient.
*   Many micronutrients exceeded RDA targets, guided by their correlations with biomarkers.

**Key Highlighted Vitamins:**
*   **Riboflavin:** 12 mg/day (~12x RDA). Intake is being optimized to test effects on homocysteine metabolism and regenerative capacity. Maximal absorption is around 30 mg/day.
*   **Niacin:** ~500 mg/day (~15-16x RDA), primarily from nicotinamide supplementation.

**Carotenoids (Alpha/Beta Carotene, Beta Cryptoxanthin, Lutein, Zeaxanthin, Lycopene):**
*   High dietary carotenoid intake is maintained due to strong associations with a younger biological age (Fage clock).
*   Studies indicate that relatively low intakes of total carotenes are significantly associated with an older Fage, while high intakes are associated with a younger Fage.
*   Beta cryptoxanthin may have a "sweet spot," where very high intakes might lose significance for a younger biological age compared to moderate-high intakes. The participant's intake aligns with these findings.

**Minerals:**
*   **Sodium:** Increased from ~1,800 mg/day (previous test) to ~2,500 mg/day (Test #6), with plans for ~2,700 mg/day for the next test.
*   This increase is an experiment to optimize heart rate variability (HRV), resting heart rate, and potentially hair graying, while carefully monitoring blood pressure.
