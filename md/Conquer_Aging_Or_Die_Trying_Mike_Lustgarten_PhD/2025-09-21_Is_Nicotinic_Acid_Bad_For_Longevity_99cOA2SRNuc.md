# 2025-09-21 Is Nicotinic Acid Bad For Longevity

## Executive Summary

*   Five longevity interventions in mice (rapamycin, acarbose, 17 alpha estradiol, canigliflozin, and caloric restriction) all show a downregulation of specific triglycerides: TG 48-3 and TG 53.
*   Higher levels of these specific triglycerides (TG 48-3 and TG 53) in humans are associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and a decreased likelihood of reaching 85 years of age.
*   Standard total triglyceride measurements from blood tests are not significantly correlated with plasma levels of TG 48-3 or TG 53.
*   Personal data suggests that Niacin (nicotinic acid) intake is correlated with higher levels of TG 48-3 and TG 53, even at doses of 100 milligrams per day.

## Mouse Data

Five longevity-extending interventions in mice (rapamycin, acarbose, 17 alpha estradiol, canigliflozin, and caloric restriction) were analyzed for common metabolomic signatures. All five interventions demonstrated a significant reduction in the levels of two specific triglycerides:

*   **Triglyceride 48-3 (TG 48-3):** Consists of 48 carbons and three double bonds, typically including fatty acids like maristic acid (14-0), palmitoleic acid (16-1), and linoleic acid (18-2).
*   **Triglyceride 53 (TG 53):** Consists of 50 carbons and three double bonds, typically including fatty acids like palmitate (16-0), palmitoleic acid (16-1), and linoleic acid (18-2).

In all five interventions, the levels of TG 48-3 and TG 53 were significantly reduced compared to control groups.

## Human Evidence

A study investigating metabolite groups and their association with all-cause mortality risk and longevity found that triglycerides with less than or equal to 56 carbons and less than or equal to three double bonds were associated with increased all-cause mortality risk and a decreased odds of reaching 85 years of age. TG 48-3 and TG 53 fall into this category.

Further analysis of individual metabolites revealed significant associations:

*   **TG 48-3:** Higher levels were associated with a 5% higher risk of death from all causes.
*   **TG 53:** Higher levels were associated with an 8% higher risk of death from all causes.

## Biomarker Tracking: Total Triglycerides vs. Specific Triglycerides

An investigation into whether tracking total triglycerides could serve as a proxy for TG 48-3 and TG 53 levels yielded the following:

*   Total triglycerides, as measured by standard blood tests, were not significantly correlated with plasma levels of TG 48-3.
*   Similar results were observed for TG 53, with P values far from the significance threshold of P < 0.05.

This suggests that maintaining generally low total triglyceride levels may not necessarily translate to lower levels of these specific triglycerides associated with longevity.

## Niacin (Nicotinic Acid) Intake and Triglyceride Levels

Analysis of personal dietary data and blood tests explored factors that could influence TG 48-3 and TG 53 levels. Niacin intake was found to be significantly correlated with higher levels of both TG 48-3 and TG 53.

*   **Initial Analysis (including potential outliers):**
    *   TG 48-3: A positive trend was observed, indicating higher Niacin intake correlated with higher TG 48-3 levels, although it was just outside statistical significance (P = 0.07).
    *   TG 53: Also showed a positive trend, but was farther from statistical significance (P = 0.17).
*   **Analysis (excluding a potential outlier):**
    *   TG 48-3: The correlation remained positive, with a P value of 0.07.
    *   TG 53: The correlation remained positive, with a P value of 0.17.

The data suggests that Niacin intake, even at doses around 100 milligrams per day, may be associated with elevated levels of TG 48-3 and TG 53, which are in turn linked with longevity mechanisms in mice and increased all-cause mortality risk in humans. This indicates that supplemental Niacin could potentially be detrimental to these specific longevity-related biomarkers.
