# 2022-08-21 Glycine + N-Acetyl Cysteine Supplementation Increases Lifespan

**Executive Summary:**
*   Glutathione levels, and its precursor amino acids Glycine and Cysteine, significantly decline with age across multiple human studies.
*   Supplementation with Glycine and N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) in older adults restores glutathione levels and improves various health markers, including reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, enhanced mitochondrial function, improved body composition, increased muscle strength, and better cognition.
*   This Glycine + NAC supplementation also extended the median lifespan of C57Black/6J mice by 24%, accompanied by glutathione restoration in key tissues (heart, liver, kidney).
*   Centenarians exhibit significantly higher blood glutathione levels and elevated precursor amino acid levels (Glycine, Cysteine, Glutamate) compared to younger individuals, suggesting a strong association between sustained glutathione levels and human longevity.

## Age-Related Decline in Glutathione

Glutathione (GSH) levels decline significantly during aging.
*   **Study 1:** A 50% glutathione reduction was observed when comparing individuals aged 21 with those older than 61.
*   **Study 2:** Blood glutathione concentrations showed a 15% reduction from newborns up to approximately 70 years of age.
*   **Study 3:** A 33% glutathione reduction was noted when comparing individuals aged 20-29 with those older than 60.

Glutathione is a tripeptide composed of three amino acids: Cysteine, Glutamic Acid, and Glycine. Research indicates that levels of Glycine and Cysteine also decline during aging.

**Glutathione Synthesis Pathway:**
Cysteine + Glutamic Acid + Glycine -> Glutathione (GSH)

Reduced Glutathione (GSH) is the form that combats oxidative stress. When glutathione is oxidized (GSSG form), it does not contribute to reducing oxidative stress.

## Restoring Glutathione with Glycine + N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) in Humans

Strategies aimed at replenishing Glycine and Cysteine (specifically N-Acetyl Cysteine as a source of Cysteine) may restore glutathione levels and improve health-related outcomes in older adults.

**Human Study 1 (Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial):**
*   **Participants:** 16 older adults (71-80 years old) with glutathione deficiency. Eight received supplementation, and eight younger adults served as a control group.
*   **Duration:** 24 weeks.
*   **Intervention:** High-dose Glycine plus N-Acetyl Cysteine supplementation.
*   **Key Findings:** Glycine + N-Acetyl Cysteine supplementation improved:
    *   Glutathione deficiency
    *   Reduced oxidative stress
    *   Reduced genomic damage (oxidative damage to DNA)
    *   Reduced markers of inflammation
    *   Reduced insulin resistance
    *   Improved mitochondrial function
    *   Reduced markers of endothelial dysfunction
    *   Improved body composition (reduced fat mass)
    *   Improved muscle strength
    *   Increased exercise capacity
    *   Improved cognition

**Human Study 2 (Expanded Randomized Controlled Trial):**
*   **Participants:** 23 people, including 11 older adults (61-80 years old) and 12 younger subjects. Only data for older adults showed significant changes.
*   **Duration:** 16 weeks.
*   **Intervention:** High-dose Glycine plus N-Acetyl Cysteine supplementation.
    *   **Dose:** 100 mg of each (Glycine and N-Acetyl Cysteine) per kilogram of body weight. For a 70 kg person, this equates to 7 grams of each per day.
*   **Key Findings:** Supplementation impacted many of the same health markers as the first study, with additional improvements in:
    *   Markers of cellular senescence
    *   Markers related to stem cells
    *   Mitophagy
    *   Reduced blood pressure

These two randomized controlled trials suggest that glutathione restoration is a promising approach for improving aging-related outcomes in older adults with age-related or other conditions leading to reduced glutathione levels.

## Glycine + N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) Supplementation Extends Mouse Lifespan

Glycine + N-Acetyl Cysteine supplementation extends lifespan in mice.
*   **Animal Model:** C57Black/6J mice.
*   **Groups:**
    *   **Control Group:** 16 mice (8 males, 8 females) fed a regular diet.
    *   **Supplemented Group:** 16 mice (8 males, 8 females) fed a regular diet plus Glycine and N-Acetyl Cysteine.
*   **Supplementation Protocol:**
    *   Started at 65 weeks of age.
    *   Dose: 1.6 mg of each (Glycine and N-Acetyl Cysteine) per gram of food, a dose similar to human studies.
*   **Results:** The median lifespan of the Glycine + N-Acetyl Cysteine supplemented group increased by 24% (129 weeks compared to 104 weeks for controls).
*   **Limitations:** The study had a relatively small sample size (16 mice per group). Food consumption and body weights were not reported, making it unclear if a mild calorie restriction, which can extend lifespan, contributed to the observed effects.
*   **Strengths:** The study demonstrated glutathione restoration in multiple tissues.
    *   Levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) were significantly lower in old animals compared to young animals in the heart, liver, and kidney.
    *   Supplementation of old animals with Glycine + N-Acetyl Cysteine restored glutathione levels to near-young levels in these tissues.
    *   This indicates that the lifespan-extending effect of Glycine + N-Acetyl Cysteine supplementation is associated with glutathione restoration in multiple tissues.

## Glutathione Levels and Longevity in Centenarians

Centenarians exhibit relatively higher levels of glutathione.
*   **Study Participants:**
    *   **Centenarian-proximal group:** 116 subjects with an average age of 97 years.
    *   **Younger offspring group:** 232 subjects with an average age of 67 years.
*   **Findings:** The centenarian-proximal group had significantly higher average blood glutathione levels compared to the younger group, showing approximately a 50% relatively higher level of glutathione. This data was statistically significant.
*   **Conclusion:** Maintaining relatively high glutathione levels may be important for longevity.
*   **Further Findings:** The component amino acids of glutathione (Cysteine, Glycine, and Glutamate) were also significantly higher in the centenarian-proximal group compared to the younger group, potentially explaining the elevated glutathione levels.
