# 2025-03-23 Cortisol Increases During Aging - A Sign Of Low NAD

## Executive Summary
*   Cortisol levels increase with age, potentially reaching levels associated with Cushing syndrome.
*   Cortisone levels decline with age, peaking in youth.
*   Cortisol is converted to cortisone with the requirement of NAD.
*   Lower NAD levels are significantly correlated with a higher cortisol to cortisone ratio.
*   Increasing NAD may weaken the correlation between low NAD and a high cortisol to cortisone ratio.

## Age-Related Hormone Changes
### Cortisol
*   Plasma cortisol levels increase from birth through 80 years of age in both men and women.
*   The age-related increase in cortisol can potentially reach levels similar to those observed in Cushing syndrome (e.g., 470 nanomolar).
*   Excessively high cortisol, as seen in Cushing syndrome, negatively impacts multiple organ systems, with some overlaps with age-related changes, including visceral obesity, osteoporosis, and heart disease.

### Cortisone
*   Plasma cortisone levels peak in youth and decline with age in both men and women.
*   Cortisone can act as a local anti-inflammatory agent, as seen in its use for sore arms in baseball pitchers.

## Cortisol to Cortisone Conversion and NAD
The conversion of cortisol to cortisone is a key metabolic process influenced by NAD:

Cortisol  ->  Cortisone
(in the presence of Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase)
**Requires NAD**

*   NAD is a necessary cofactor for the conversion of cortisol into cortisone.
*   If NAD levels are low, the conversion of cortisol to cortisone will be reduced.
*   NAD levels decline during aging.

This leads to the hypothesis that low NAD is associated with a high cortisol to cortisone ratio. When NAD is low, cortisol cannot be efficiently converted to cortisone, resulting in a higher ratio of cortisol to cortisone.

## Personal Metabolomics Data Analysis
### Study Methodology
*   At-home metabolomics kits (e.g., IOLO's kit) were used to track cortisol and cortisone levels.
*   Blood samples were concurrently sent to Ginfinity for NAD analysis.

### Initial Findings (First 9 Tests)
*   A significant inverse correlation was observed between the cortisol to cortisone ratio and NAD levels.
*   The p-value was less than 0.05, and the correlation coefficient (r) was less than -0.7, indicating a strong correlation.
*   These results support the hypothesis that lower NAD is significantly correlated with a higher cortisol to cortisone ratio.

### Intervention and Subsequent Findings (Test 10)
*   An intervention was implemented to increase NAD levels: 200 mg/day of nicotinic acid was used, resulting in an NAD level of 48 micromolar.
*   In test 10, the inverse correlation between the cortisol to cortisone ratio and NAD persisted but weakened significantly.
*   The p-value became non-significant (greater than 0.05).
*   The correlation coefficient weakened from -0.86 to -0.42, approximately halved.

### Interpretation and Future Directions
*   While the totality of 10 tests suggests that low NAD is no longer significantly correlated with the cortisol to cortisone ratio, one data point (test 10) heavily influenced this outcome.
*   Further data points are needed, particularly in the NAD range of 33-48 micromolar, to fully explore the correlation.
*   Test number 11 is scheduled for March 18, including NAD analysis, metabolomics, and clinical chemistry biomarkers to gather more data.
