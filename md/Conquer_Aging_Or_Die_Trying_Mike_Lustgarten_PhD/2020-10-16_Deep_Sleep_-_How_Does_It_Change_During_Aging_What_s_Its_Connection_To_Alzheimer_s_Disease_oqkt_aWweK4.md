# 2020-10-16 Deep Sleep - How Does It Change During Aging What s Its Connection To Alzheimer s Disease

**Executive Summary:**

*   Slow-wave sleep (SWS), or deep sleep, significantly declines with aging, showing a roughly three-fold reduction between 20 and 80 years old.
*   Higher SWS activity is correlated with a reduced four-year accumulation of brain amyloid-beta (Aβ) in older adults, a key indicator for Alzheimer's disease.
*   Amyloid-beta at neuronal synapses induces hyperactivation, which leads to neurodegeneration.
*   Strategies like maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and abstaining from food/drink at least three hours before bedtime are suggested for optimizing SWS.
*   While increased daily calorie intake correlates positively with total sleep time and SWS, it can negatively affect resting heart rate and heart rate variability, highlighting the need to find an optimal balance.

**Introduction to Sleep Stages**

Sleep stages are measured against hours of sleep. When falling asleep, individuals progress through various sleep stages:
*   **Light sleep:** N1 and N2 stages.
*   **Deep sleep:** N3 stage, also known as slow-wave sleep (SWS).

A typical sleep cycle involves progressing through N2, then to N3 (deep sleep), then back to N2, and finally to REM sleep for a few minutes. This process repeats throughout the night. Most deep sleep accumulates within the first four hours of sleep, then diminishes. Conversely, REM sleep starts low and accumulates throughout the night, becoming more prevalent towards waking.

## Deep Sleep Changes During Aging

Total sleep time declines with aging. A meta-analysis of 65 studies indicates:
*   **20-year-olds:** Sleep approximately 450 minutes per night.
*   **80-year-olds:** Sleep approximately 350 minutes per night.

The percentage of slow-wave sleep (SWS) relative to total sleep time also declines during aging:
*   **20-year-olds:** About 20% of total sleep time is SWS. With 450 minutes of total sleep, this equates to approximately 90 minutes of deep sleep per night.
*   **80-year-olds:** About 9% of total sleep time is SWS. With 350 minutes of total sleep, this equates to approximately 32 minutes of deep sleep per night.
    *   This represents about a three-fold reduction in SWS for older adults compared to younger individuals.

## Connection to Alzheimer's Disease

Reduced sleep, particularly slow-wave sleep, is linked with Alzheimer's disease and amyloid-beta (Aβ) production.

A longitudinal study of 76-year-old subjects found that a higher baseline proportion of slow-wave activity during sleep correlated with a reduced four-year accumulation of brain amyloid-beta. Individuals with higher brain slow-wave activity during sleep had lower levels of Aβ accumulation over a four-year period. Conversely, subjects with a lower proportion of slow-wave sleep had a higher rate of Aβ accumulation in their brains.

**Biological Mechanism of Amyloid-Beta's Impact:**
Amyloid-beta affects synapses, the points where neurons communicate.

*   **Normal Synapse (No Aβ present)** -> Normal neuronal activity -> Normal interneuronal communication
*   **Synapse (High Aβ present)** -> Induces neuronal hyperactivation -> Leads to neurodegeneration

Therefore, achieving sufficient deep sleep to minimize Aβ accumulation is crucial.

## Methods for Sleep Tracking

The speaker tracks slow-wave sleep using a fitness tracker (WHOOP). WHOOP's performance has been compared against polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard for measuring sleep stages in overnight sleep studies.

**WHOOP vs. PSG Comparison for Sleep Stage Detection:**
*   **Total Sleep Time (TST):** WHOOP was as accurate as PSG.
*   **Wakefulness:** No statistical difference from PSG.
*   **Light Sleep:** No statistical difference from PSG.
*   **Slow-Wave Sleep (SWS):** WHOOP was as accurate as PSG, with no statistically significant difference between the two methods.
*   **REM Sleep:** WHOOP overestimated REM sleep by about 15 minutes.

Based on this small study, WHOOP appears to be as good as PSG for detecting total sleep time and slow-wave sleep.

## Personal Sleep Data and Optimization Strategies

The speaker's slow-wave sleep data over 526 days (May 2019 - October 2020) indicates an average of 93 minutes of SWS per day, an amount considered relatively youthful. Optimizing slow-wave sleep may potentially reduce the accumulation of brain amyloid-beta.

**Strategies for SWS Optimization:**
*   **Maintain a consistent sleep schedule:** Aim to go to sleep between 9 PM and 10 PM every night, or even earlier. The principle is to align sleep with darkness.
*   **Stop eating or drinking at least three hours before bedtime:** This practice often extends to six to seven hours before bedtime for a longer overnight fast.

## Factors Affecting Slow-Wave Sleep and Total Sleep Time

### Impact of Total Sleep Time on SWS
The speaker's personal data shows a moderate, significant correlation between slow-wave sleep and total sleep time.
*   **Correlation:** More total sleep time correlates with more slow-wave sleep.
*   **Target:** To achieve 90 minutes of SWS (comparable to youth), approximately seven hours of total sleep per night is needed.

### Dietary Factors and Sleep
The strongest correlation identified between total sleep time and dietary variables was daily calorie intake.
*   **Correlation with Total Sleep Time:** A moderate correlation (r=0.35) exists between higher daily calorie intake and longer total sleep time.
*   **Correlation with Slow-Wave Sleep:** A weak but statistically significant correlation (r=0.13, p=0.003) exists between higher daily calorie intake and more slow-wave sleep.

### Effects of Increased Calorie Intake on Other Health Metrics
Increasing calorie intake to boost total sleep time and slow-wave sleep might negatively affect other physiological metrics:

**Impact on Cardiovascular Metrics:**
*   **Resting Heart Rate (RHR):** Higher calorie intake correlates with a higher resting heart rate. An average intake of 2500-2600 calories per day correlates to an RHR of about 48 beats per minute. Values closer to 45 bpm are associated with maximally reduced all-cause mortality risk. Increasing calorie intake further would increase RHR, moving it away from this optimal range.
*   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** Higher calorie intake correlates with reduced heart rate variability. For an intake of 2500-2600 calories per day, HRV is about 60 milliseconds. Youthful values are closer to 70 milliseconds. Increasing calorie intake would reduce HRV, which is undesirable.

**Conclusion:** It is essential to identify a calorie intake that maximizes slow-wave sleep and total sleep time without negatively affecting crucial cardiovascular metrics like resting heart rate and heart rate variability. Finding this "sweet spot" is key.
