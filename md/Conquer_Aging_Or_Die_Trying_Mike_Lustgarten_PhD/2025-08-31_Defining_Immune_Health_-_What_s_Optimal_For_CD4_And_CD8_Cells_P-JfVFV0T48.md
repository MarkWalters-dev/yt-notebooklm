# 2025-08-31 Defining Immune Health - What s Optimal For CD4 And CD8 Cells

## Executive Summary

*   Immune health is defined by a balance between CD4 and CD8 cells, using four distinct grades (Grade 1 being optimal), rather than solely relying on the CD4:CD8 ratio.
*   A key benchmark for optimal CD4 count in HIV-negative individuals is 800 cells/µL, significantly higher than typical commercial lab 'normal' ranges.
*   Population averages for immune markers (e.g., CD4 decline with age) are misleading; individual immune health can vary widely, with some older adults maintaining optimal profiles while some younger individuals exhibit degraded states.
*   Immune health degradation is sexually dimorphic, with males showing a greater propensity for decline across age than females.
*   The immune system, a pervasive network throughout the body, is the largest organ system, yet its health is often inadequately measured and staged clinically.

## Immune Health Grades: Definition and Metrics

Immune health grades measure the balance between CD8 and CD4 cells, rather than solely the CD4:CD8 ratio. Transcriptomic metrics, specifically Survival Associated Signature 1 (SAS1) and Mortality Associated Signature 1, are also used to assess immunocompetence and inflammation-associated genes.

A 2010 study published in the *New England Journal of Medicine*, involving the screening of 11,000-14,000 HIV-negative individuals, established a median CD4 count of 800 cells/µL as a lower benchmark for optimal immune health. This 800 CD4 count serves as a crucial benchmark, contrasting with broader commercial lab 'normal' ranges (e.g., 340-1500 cells/µL), which are considered too wide to indicate true immune health.

The CD4:CD8 ratio is used as an indirect proxy for the relative levels of CD8 cells compared to CD4 cells, emphasizing the balance rather than the ratio itself. Based on this balance and CD4 counts, four immune health grades are defined:

*   **Grade 1 (Optimal Immune Health):**
    *   CD4:CD8 ratio > 1 (indicating preserved lower CD8s relative to CD4s)
    *   AND CD4 count >= 800 cells/µL
*   **Grade 2 (Compromised CD4, but preserved CD4:CD8 balance):**
    *   CD4:CD8 ratio > 1 (indicating restrained CD8s relative to CD4s)
    *   BUT lower CD4 counts (< 800 cells/µL)
*   **Grade 3 (Expanded CD8s, with lower CD4s):**
    *   CD4:CD8 ratio < 1 (indicating expanded CD8s relative to CD4s)
    *   Associated with high CD8s and lower CD4s
*   **Grade 4 (Severely Compromised Immune Health):**
    *   CD4:CD8 ratio < 1 (indicating expanded CD8s relative to CD4s)
    *   Associated with high CD8s and low CD4s

## The Limitations of Averages and Importance of Individual Staging

Younger adults and children typically exhibit higher CD4 cell counts, and the general CD4:CD8 ratio is often around 2:1 across ages. With aging, CD4 counts generally decline while CD8 counts tend to increase, often resulting in a lower CD4:CD8 ratio in older populations.

However, relying on population averages can be misleading. While average trends show immune decline with age, individuals display significant heterogeneity. For instance, an 80-year-old person can preserve optimal immune health (Grade 1), similar to a younger individual, while some younger individuals may present immune profiles characteristic of an 80-year-old (Grade 4).

The goal is to move beyond averages and metricize individual immune health, allowing for clinical staging and personalized monitoring. A CD4 count of 351 cells/µL, though within some 'normal' lab ranges, would be a concern regardless of a person's age. Categorizing individuals into immune health grades allows for tracking personal shifts in response to events like infections. For example, an individual might transition from Grade 2a to Grade 4 during a COVID infection, then recover to Grade 2, but not fully return to their original Grade 1. This individual monitoring offers more actionable insights than population-based averages.

This approach parallels the staging of cancer, providing a structured way to assess and track the progression of immune health, which is currently lacking in many clinical practices for infectious diseases or gerontology.

## The Immune System: A Pervasive and Under-Measured Organ System

The immune system is the largest organ system in the body, pervasive throughout every organ and tissue. It includes:

*   Microglia and glial cells in the brain
*   Neurons
*   The brain-gut axis and brain-immune axis
*   The extensive microbial system from mouth to anus
*   Immune cells embedded within the kidney, liver, spleen, and other organs

Despite its vastness and critical role, physicians often inadequately measure or monitor immune health. Developing accessible and effective measures for immune health is crucial to address this overlooked component of overall well-being.

## Cohort Analysis: Age, Sex, and Phenotype Extremes

In a large cohort of 3,000 individuals, Grade 1 (optimal immune health) is the most common, followed by Grade 2, with fewer individuals in Grades 3 and 4 in a generally healthy population.

Visual inspection of individual CD4 and CD8 counts alone is insufficient to intuit an individual's immune health grade. For example, CD4 counts might appear relatively normal across different grades, but CD8 counts can vary significantly. Grade 3 individuals might have twice the CD8s of Grade 1 for similar CD4 levels, and Grade 4 individuals might have twice the CD8s of Grade 2 for similar low CD4 levels.

Analysis of the cohort from age 15 to over 90 years indicates that the capacity to preserve Grade 1 decreases with age, alongside an expansion of individuals in other grades. However, studying the extremes of phenotype provides critical insights; among individuals aged 90 and above, approximately 25% maintain optimal immune health (Grade 1). Understanding the factors contributing to this resistance to immune degradation is highly informative, just as understanding early mortality in otherwise healthy young individuals provides paradoxes for study.

Younger individuals in Grade 4, for example, exhibit reduced responsiveness to flu vaccines, similar to older individuals. This suggests that certain immune traits are consistent within specific immune health grades, irrespective of age. Traditional studies comparing older and younger populations often conflate heterogeneous groups, leading to confounding results.

Immune health degradation also exhibits sexual dimorphism across age. Males show a greater propensity for the degradation of Grade 1 immune health compared to females, even in post-menopausal stages, suggesting factors beyond solely hormones.

**Key Findings:**

*   Some older individuals demonstrate resistance to immune degradation.
*   This resistance is more pronounced in females compared to males across all ages.
*   Immune traits are influenced by two primary factors: age and the assigned immune health grade.
