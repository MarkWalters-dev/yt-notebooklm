    *   Current Result: 0.45
    *   Optimal Range: 0.2 to 0.6.
    *   Analysis: Within the optimal range.

### Inflammation and Cardiovascular Markers

*   **HSCRP (High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein):**
    *   Current Result: <0.2 mg/L
    *   Trend: Undetectable (<0.3 mg/L for 23 tests, <0.2 mg/L for the last 6 tests).
    *   Analysis: Remains at the detection limit, indicating very low inflammation.
*   **Homocysteine:**
    *   Current Result: 11.1 mg/dL
    *   Historical Data: Values close to half of this were observed approximately 20 years ago.
    *   Potential Intervention: Combination supplement of Methyl B12, Methylfolate, and low-dose B6.
    *   Analysis: Identified as a weak spot. Reintroduction of a combination supplement is planned, with re-testing in 3-4 weeks.

### Kidney Function Markers

*   **Creatinine:**
    *   Current Result: 0.76 mg/dL
    *   Historical Average (59 tests since 2015): 0.94 mg/dL.
    *   Analysis: On the lower side of the individual's historical range, which is positive as creatinine levels increase with age.
*   **Cystatin C:**
    *   Current Result: 0.79 mg/L
    *   Optimal Range for Lowest All-Cause Mortality Risk: <0.7 mg/L.
    *   Analysis: Not in the optimal range for lowest risk. Identified as an area for improvement, as it is a component of the GrimAge epigenetic clock.

### Liver Function Markers

*   **AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) & ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase):**
    *   Analysis: Both values moved slightly away from the optimal range (high teens, low twenties) compared to the last test.
*   **GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase):**
    *   Previous Result: 12 (considered good and associated with low all-cause mortality risk).
    *   Analysis: Reintroduction planned due to the slight upward trend in AST and ALT.
*   **Albumin:**
    *   Current Result: 5.4 g/dL (flagged as high by the lab).
    *   Trend: Albumin levels decline during aging. Relatively higher levels are associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk, even in centenarians.
    *   Analysis: Considered good news, as higher levels are protective and unlikely to be due to dehydration given other biomarker stability.
*   **Alkaline Phosphatase:**
    *   Current Result: 41 U/L
    *   Trend: Consistently on the lower side across many tests.
    *   Analysis: Supports the assessment of good liver health and function.

### Glucose Metabolism

*   **Glucose:**
    *   Current Result: 91 mg/dL
    *   Historical Average (approx. 60 tests since 2015): 90 mg/dL.
    *   Optimal Range: 80-94 mg/dL.
    *   Analysis: Relatively good and within the optimal range.
*   **Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c):**
    *   Current Result: 5.3%
    *   Historical Data: Lower values observed since 2015, but measured infrequently.
    *   Target: 5.0-5.1%.
    *   Analysis: Identified as a weak spot. Planning to measure at every test going forward to track and aim for the target range.

### Thyroid Hormones

*   **Free T4 (fT4) & Free T3 (fT3) Ratio:**
    *   Current Ratio: -0.18
    *   Trend: The ratio of fT3 to fT4 declines with age due to reduced conversion of fT4 to fT3.
    *   Analysis: This ratio is significantly worse than expected for chronological age and even older than expected. This indicates a poor conversion of T4 to the active fT3 form, a known weakness.
    *   Intervention: Thyroid medication adjusted to include a small amount of T3. Future tests will assess the impact.

### Other Biomarkers

*   **IGG (Immunoglobulin G):**
    *   Current Result: 1100 mg/dL
    *   Trend: IGG levels increase with aging. Interventions that reduce it are associated with increased lifespan.
    *   Analysis: Optimal levels are difficult to define due to a lack of large-scale epidemiological data. Future analysis will focus on correlations with other biomarkers over time.
*   **White Blood Cells (WBC):**
    *   Current Result: 3.2 x 10^3 / µL (flagged as low by the lab).
    *   Analysis: Low WBC count is a concern, with potential implications for all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Hemoglobin:**
    *   Current Result: 15.2 g/dL
    *   Historical Average (55 tests since 2015): 15 g/dL.
    *   Trend: Hemoglobin levels decline during aging.
    *   Analysis: Maintaining levels at 15.2 g/dL is positive and suggests malleability to keep levels relatively high, avoiding age-related decline.
*   **MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume):**
    *   Current Result: Closer to the lower end of the individual's range (91 units).
    *   Trend: MCV increases during aging; recent tests trended higher towards 93 units.
    *   Analysis: A positive trend back towards the lower end of the range.
*   **RDW (Red Cell Distribution Width):**
    *   Current Result: 11.8%
    *   Trend: RDW increases during aging and is a major predictor in biological age tests.
    *   Analysis: A relatively low and good RDW.
*   **Neutrophils:**
    *   Current Result: Below the optimal range.
    *   Optimal Range: 2,000 to 3,000 cells/µL.
    *   Analysis: Below the optimal range, which is associated with increased all-cause mortality risk. Neutrophils increase with age, so being on the lower side is preferred.
*   **Lymphocytes:**
    *   Current Result: The lowest reading since 2015.
    *   Trend: Lymphocytes decline during aging.
    *   Analysis: Identified as a weak spot and a concern. This decline aligns with published data.
    *   Correlation with HDL: A significant inverse correlation exists between lymphocytes and HDL in the individual's data, mirroring published findings.
    *   Plan: Reduce HDL to the mid-to-lower fifties to potentially increase lymphocyte levels closer to optimal.
*   **DHEA Sulfate (Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate):**
    *   Current Result: 136 µg/dL
    *   Trend: DHEA sulfate declines during aging.
    *   Historical Data: Two values around 300 were observed 20 years ago, but supplementation status is unknown.
    *   Average over 20 tests (past 3 years): 126 µg/dL.
    *   Analysis: Maintaining levels on the higher end of the individual's range (136 µg/dL in this test) is positive and helps resist age-related decline.
*   **Candida IGG:**
    *   Current Result: 1.2 (arbitrary units)
    *   Trend: One of the highest values observed.
    *   Analysis: Indicates the immune system is working harder to manage Candida levels. Dietary changes prior to this test did not show a difference. Continued efforts to reduce these levels are planned.

## Future Plans

*   Re-test homocysteine after 3-4 weeks of a new supplement regimen.
*   Monitor thyroid hormone conversion after medication adjustment.
*   Continue tracking IGG to analyze correlations with other biomarkers.
*   Implement strategies to reduce HDL to optimize both HDL and lymphocyte levels.
*   Continue efforts to lower Candida IGG.
*   Detailed analysis of diet and supplements corresponding to the biological age results will be released in a future video.
