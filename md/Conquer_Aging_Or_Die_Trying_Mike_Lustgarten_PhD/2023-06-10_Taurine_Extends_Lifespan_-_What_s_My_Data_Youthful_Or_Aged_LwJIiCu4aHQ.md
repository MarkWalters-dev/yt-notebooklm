# 2023-06-10 Taurine Extends Lifespan - What's My Data Youthful Or Aged

## Executive Summary

*   Serum taurine levels decline with age in both mice and humans.
*   Taurine supplementation significantly extends lifespan in both female and male mice.
*   Home metabolomics data suggests the speaker's current taurine levels are relatively youthful.
*   Monitoring taurine levels over time is recommended to inform potential future supplementation or dietary changes.

## Mouse Data

### Taurine Levels Decline with Age

Serum taurine levels were plotted against age in weeks for mice. The data shows a significant age-related decline in serum taurine levels.

### Taurine Supplementation Extends Lifespan

*   Survival data was analyzed for female and male mice.
*   Median survival, defined as the time when half the colony has died, was evaluated.
*   Taurine supplemented mice showed a rightward shift in their survival curves.
*   Conclusion: Taurine extends lifespan in both female and male mice.

## Human Evidence

### Taurine Levels Decline with Age in Humans

*   Serum taurine levels were plotted against age, up to approximately 60 years old.
*   Similar to mice, an age-related decline in serum taurine levels was observed in humans.

## Personal Data and Recommendations

### At-Home Metabolomics for Taurine Measurement

*   The speaker utilized at-home metabolomics with iolo for personal data collection.
*   In April 2023, the speaker's circulating taurine level was 173.1.
*   Based on this measurement, the speaker's taurine level is considered relatively youthful.

### Future Monitoring and Potential Intervention

*   The speaker does not currently believe taurine supplementation is necessary.
*   Future blood tests will be used to monitor taurine levels.
*   If an age-related decline in taurine is observed, dietary changes and/or supplementation will be considered.
