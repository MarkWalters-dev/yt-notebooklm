# 2022-12-04 Methionine Restriction Extends Lifespan - Roles For SCFAs And FGF21 But Not Calorie Restriction

**Executive Summary:**
*   Methionine restriction (MR) significantly extends both median and maximal lifespan in male and female mice.
*   MR is not a form of calorie restriction; methionine-restricted mice consume more food but exhibit reduced body weight.
*   MR leads to significantly increased fecal and plasma levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetate, propionate, and butyrate.
*   SCFAs are also increased by Acarbose, a known lifespan-extending drug, suggesting that elevated SCFAs may be a mechanism by which MR extends lifespan.
*   MR significantly increases plasma levels of Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF21), a hormone that has been shown to extend lifespan in transgenic mice overexpressing FGF21.

## Methionine Restriction Extends Lifespan

Methionine restriction (MR) significantly extends lifespan in mice.

*   **Male Mice Study:**
    *   **Control Group:** Fed a diet of 0.43% methionine.
    *   **Methionine Restricted Group:** Fed a diet of 0.15% methionine (a 65% reduction in dietary methionine).
    *   **Results:** Significant increases were observed in both median survival (time when 50% of the colony had died) and maximal survival (time when 90% of the colony had died) in methionine-restricted male mice.

*   **Female Mice Study:**
    *   **Control Group:** Fed a diet of 0.43% methionine.
    *   **Methionine Restricted Group:** Fed a diet of 0.15% methionine.
    *   **Results:** Significant increases were also observed in both median and maximal survival in methionine-restricted female mice.

## Methionine Restriction Is Not Calorie Restriction

A key question is whether methionine restriction (MR) acts as a form of calorie restriction. This was investigated in a 60-day study using eight-week-old male mice.

*   **Study Groups:**
    *   **Low Methionine (LM):** 0.17% methionine
    *   **Normal Methionine (NM):** 0.86% methionine
    *   **High Methionine (HM):** 2.58% methionine

*   **Body Weight:** The LM group exhibited a significantly reduced body weight compared to both the NM and HM groups.

*   **Food Intake:** Contrary to calorie restriction, the LM group consumed significantly *more* food per mouse per day compared to the higher methionine intake groups (NM and HM).

**Conclusion:** Methionine-restricted mice are not calorie restricted, as they eat more food despite having lower body weight. This indicates that MR extends lifespan through mechanisms other than calorie restriction.

## Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) Are Increased By Methionine Restriction

Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) may explain the extended lifespan in methionine-restricted mice. The most abundant SCFAs are acetate, propionate, and butyrate. SCFAs are known to be increased by a high soluble fiber diet or exercise training.

*   **Fecal SCFAs:** Methionine-restricted mice (low methionine intake group) exhibited significantly higher fecal levels of acetate, propionate, and butyrate compared to groups with higher methionine intakes.

*   **Plasma SCFAs:** Similarly, methionine restriction led to significantly higher plasma levels of acetate, propionate, and butyrate when compared to higher methionine intake groups.

**Conclusion:** Methionine restriction significantly increases both fecal and plasma levels of short chain fatty acids.

## SCFAs and Lifespan Extension: The Acarbose Connection

To understand how SCFAs relate to lifespan extension, data from Acarbose studies are relevant. Acarbose is a drug known to extend lifespan.

*   **Acarbose Extends Lifespan:** Pooled data from genetically heterogeneous mice across three study sites (University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, University of Michigan, and The Jackson Laboratory) showed that Acarbose supplementation significantly increased both median and maximal lifespan in male and female mice.

*   **Acarbose Increases Fecal SCFAs:** Fecal levels of SCFAs were also found to be increased in Acarbose-supplemented mice across these study sites:
    *   Fecal acetate and butyrate levels were higher in Acarbose-treated mice at the University of Texas.
    *   Fecal propionate levels were higher in Acarbose-treated mice at all three study sites.
    *   Total SCFA levels were significantly higher in Acarbose-supplemented mice at the University of Texas.

**Implication:** Given that Acarbose extends lifespan and increases SCFAs, these data collectively suggest a potential role for SCFAs in the longevity observed in methionine-restricted mice.

**Mechanism Relationship:**
Methionine Restriction (MR) -> Increased SCFAs
Acarbose -> Increased SCFAs -> Lifespan Extension
Therefore, SCFAs are a potential pathway for MR-induced lifespan extension.

## FGF21 Is Increased By Methionine Restriction and Extends Lifespan

Beyond SCFAs, methionine restriction also impacts FGF21, another factor linked to lifespan extension.

*   **FGF21 Extends Lifespan:**
    *   **Study Groups:** Transgenic (TG) mice were genetically engineered to have persistently higher systemic levels of FGF21 throughout their lifespan, compared to mice with normal FGF21 levels.
    *   **Results:** Pooled data (males and females) showed significant increases in both median and maximal survival (defined as 5% survival) in FGF21 overexpressing mice.
    *   **FGF21 Levels:** These FGF21 overexpressing mice had 5 to 10-fold higher levels of circulating FGF21 (both fed and fasting states) compared to control mice.

*   **Methionine Restriction Increases FGF21:**
    *   Plasma FGF21 levels were significantly increased in methionine-restricted mice.
    *   The low methionine intake group showed at least a two-fold increase in plasma FGF21 compared to the normal and high methionine intake groups.

**Mechanism Relationship:**
Methionine Restriction (MR) -> Increased FGF21
High FGF21 Levels (transgenic mice) -> Lifespan Extension
Therefore, FGF21 is another potential pathway for MR-induced lifespan extension.
