# 2023-11-12 Conquer Aging or Die Trying Podcast Episode 1 - Crissman Loomis @Unaging.com

## Executive Summary

*   **Fundamental Longevity Pillars:** Achieving an average lifespan of 90 years is linked to five key habits: maintaining a BMI below 25, not smoking, moderate alcohol intake, engaging in over six hours of moderate-to-vigorous exercise per week, and adhering to a healthy diet.
*   **Exercise Dose & Type:** Optimizing for all-cause mortality involves a combination of strength training, aerobic exercise, and high-intensity interval training, each offering distinct longevity benefits. Exceeding certain thresholds (e.g., over two hours/week of strength training) can diminish or negate benefits.
*   **Calorie Restriction & Circadian Alignment:** In animal models, calorie restriction significantly extends maximum lifespan, with greater effects observed when combined with time-restricted eating (fasting) and circadian alignment (eating during the natural active phase).
*   **Biomarker-Driven Personalization:** To push beyond average lifespan gains, a biomarker-driven approach allows for personalized titration of diet and exercise. Tracking metrics like heart rate variability, resting heart rate, blood pressure, NAD, and homocysteine helps optimize individual physiological responses for youthful organ and systemic function.
*   **Importance of Mobility & Balance:** Beyond traditional strength and cardiovascular fitness, maintaining mobility, flexibility, and balance throughout life is crucial for a youthful movement pattern, preventing age-related decline, and improving overall quality of life.

## Introduction to Longevity Philosophy

The pursuit of longevity extends beyond general recommendations for reaching an average lifespan of 90 years. These foundational habits include:
*   A Body Mass Index (BMI) less than 25.
*   Not smoking.
*   Moderate alcohol intake.
*   More than six hours of moderate-to-vigorous exercise per week.
*   A high-quality diet, as defined by indices like the Alternative Healthy Diet Eating Index.

To potentially extend the lifespan further, interventions beyond these general guidelines are necessary. The biggest areas for intervention are exercise dose and diet quality. This involves a precise, data-driven approach, focusing on all-cause mortality data and individual biomarkers.

The goal is to analyze the impact on all-cause mortality, which is the best general criterion for prioritizing interventions to reduce premature death. However, when data is lacking—such as for extreme dietary intakes or exercise volumes—a biomarker-driven approach becomes crucial. This involves tracking numerous biomarkers related to organ and systemic function (e.g., kidney, liver, cardiovascular, metabolic health, inflammation) to identify optimal, youthful ranges rather than just standard reference ranges, which are designed to indicate disease, not optimal health or longevity.

## Exercise and Physical Activity

Studies indicate that while general exercise is beneficial, specific types and dosages are key for maximizing longevity and reducing all-cause mortality.

**Exercise Categories and Benefits:**
Studies show distinct benefits from various types of physical activity, which appear to act as separate "buckets" of longevity benefits without significant overlap or substitution:
*   **Aerobic Exercise:** Regular dosage, with significant benefits observed after the first 15 minutes per session.
*   **High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT):** Approximately 15 minutes per week can significantly improve VO2 max and overall longevity. VO2 max improvements contribute substantially to reduced all-cause mortality, with most benefit seen up to a VO2 max of 40, and a further 10% reduction when increasing from 40 to 50.
*   **Strength Training:** Provides significant benefits, but these benefits plateau or even decline if weekly strength training duration exceeds one hour, and can become detrimental beyond two and a half hours total per week.
*   **Walking:** Even for individuals engaging in other forms of exercise, additional walking contributes to longevity.
*   **Mobility, Flexibility, and Balance Training:** Often overlooked, these are crucial for maintaining youthful movement patterns, joint health, and preventing age-related decline. Strength training through a full range of motion can also improve flexibility more effectively than stretching alone.

**Crissman's Exercise Protocol:**
Crissman follows a personalized, biomarker-driven approach to optimize his exercise for maximum lifespan, considering exercise as a hormetic stressor.
*   **Frequency and Duration:** Two 90-minute workouts per week.
*   **Components:**
    *   Weightlifting: Focuses on compound movements (pull-ups, push-ups off a ball, shoulder press, deadlifts). Typically involves a warm-up set and two work sets for each compound movement, with a pyramid approach (e.g., 70% of 1RM, then 85% or higher). Total actual strength training movement time is around 30-45 minutes per session.
    *   Calisthenics.
    *   Mobility, flexibility, and balance exercises.
    *   Some Taekwondo movements.
*   **Goals:** Optimize muscle mass and function, attenuate age-related decline, maintain strength and fitness metrics (e.g., overhead press, push-ups).
*   **Recovery Monitoring:** Tracks Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Resting Heart Rate (RHR) to prevent overtraining. If these metrics show chronic stress, workout volume is reduced.
*   **Daily Activity:** Incorporates daily walking (20,000-40,000 steps) via a walking desk.

**Chris' Exercise Protocol:**
*   **Aerobic Training:** Two 25-minute runs per week.
*   **Strength Training:** One 30-minute session per week, focusing on major compound movements (deadlifts, squats, bench press, back exercises like lat pulldowns or rows).
*   **High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT):** Approximately 15 minutes per week (e.g., Tabata-style burpees).
*   **Balance Training:** Incorporates activities like riding a bicycle without hands.
*   **Total Duration:** Total exercise time is under 90 minutes per week.

## Dietary Strategies for Longevity

Dietary choices play a critical role, with emphasis on calorie intake and nutrient composition.

**Key Dietary Principles:**
*   **Total Calorie Intake:** This is considered one of the biggest factors in longevity. The goal is to identify a dietary approach that leads to the leanest body weight while sustaining muscle mass, potentially through modest calorie restriction (e.g., up to 35% reduction, gradually achieved).
*   **Calorie Restriction vs. Exercise:** In animal studies, calorie restriction without exercise has shown an even greater increase in average lifespan and maximum lifespan compared to exercise alone.
*   **Optimal Nutrition:** While calorie restriction is paramount, the composition of the diet—whether 60% fat or 10% fat—can vary and should be individualized based on biomarker responses.
*   **Food Categories:** Studies suggest that longevity benefits often come from consuming general categories of food (e.g., fruits, vegetables, beans) rather than specific items within those categories. For example, a small daily portion of nuts (less than an ounce) can reduce all-cause mortality by approximately 17%, with no additional benefit beyond that amount.
*   **Red Meat and Processed Meat:** These have distinct curves of benefit or detriment for all-cause mortality, indicating specific recommended intake levels.
*   **Sugar:** The impact of sugar is debated, with some views suggesting it is overly vilified when consumed within an otherwise healthy diet and appropriate calorie limits.

**Crissman's Dietary Approach:**
Crissman follows a highly structured, biomarker-driven diet to achieve optimal health and longevity.
*   **Calorie-Controlled and Satiating:** Designed to allow for modest calorie restriction while maintaining satiety and muscle mass.
*   **Food Composition:** Primarily plant-based, incorporating:
    *   ~300 grams of mushrooms daily (source of spermidine, ergothioneine, and niacin).
    *   Sardines daily.
    *   Dairy daily.
    *   ~5 eggs per week.
*   **Specific Nutrient Focus:**
    *   **Niacin:** High intake from mushrooms and sardines. While niacin is crucial for NAD and mitochondrial function, Crissman's NAD levels were unexpectedly low (20-25 micromolar). This indicated that the niacin from mushrooms might be primarily nicotinamide, which can affect homocysteine levels.
    *   **Homocysteine Management:** To counter potential increases in homocysteine from nicotinamide, Crissman:
        *   Reduced mushroom intake.
        *   Increased Vitamin B12 and folate intake (average 1000 micrograms/day, 2.5 times the RDA).
*   **Fasting/Time-Restricted Eating:** Incorporates daily time-restricted eating with an eating window of less than 8 hours. On three days a week, 90% of calories are consumed within a 1.5-hour morning window. This approach significantly improves sleep quality and reduces nighttime awakenings.
*   **Minimal Cheat Meals:** Infrequent cheat days to prevent overeating and maintain dietary discipline.

**Chris' Dietary Approach:**
*   **Less Strict:** Less precise than Crissman's, but adheres to fundamental healthy eating guidelines.
*   **Meal Structure:**
    *   Healthy breakfast: 2-3 whole grain servings (oatmeal, wheat berries), salad beans, hummus, vegetables, fruit, small handful of nuts.
    *   Later meals: Salad for more vegetables, fish for dinner.
*   **Fasting:** Follows a 5:2 fasting system (two days per week under 500 calories, the rest of the week eating ad libitum).
*   **Breakfast Consumption:** Emphasizes not skipping breakfast, as studies show it can lead to a slower metabolism, increased hunger, and a preference for junkier foods later in the day.
*   **Sugar Intake:** Views sugar as less vilified, allowing for occasional treats like croissants, while maintaining overall healthy habits.

## Biomarker-Driven Optimization

Both speakers extensively discuss the utility of biomarkers to fine-tune interventions.

**Crissman's Biomarker Philosophy:**
*   Uses close to 50 blood tests since 2015 to guide his interventions.
*   Focuses on optimizing a full panel of biomarkers across organ systems (kidney, liver, immune, red blood cells, inflammation, metabolic health) to achieve a youthful biochemical profile.
*   **Body Weight and Blood Pressure:** Body weight is a strong correlate for blood pressure, which in turn relates to dementia risk. Maintaining a lean body mass through calorie restriction is seen as crucial for optimizing these markers.
*   **BMI Considerations:** While some studies suggest an overweight BMI (25-30) might be associated with lower risk in older ages (possibly due to fat's compensatory role in immune function or cholesterol's immune-enhancing properties), Crissman argues that a lifelong lean state (similar to a youthful control group) is ideal for comprehensive biomarker optimization.
*   **NAD and Niacin:** Specifics on NAD and niacin intake, and how it impacts homocysteine.
    `Niacin (Nicotinamide isoform) -> Potential increase in Homocysteine`
    `Homocysteine + Folate + Vitamin B12 -> Methionine (conversion pathway)`
    Adjustments to niacin sources (reducing mushrooms) and increasing folate/B12 are made to optimize homocysteine levels.
*   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Resting Heart Rate (RHR):** These are critical indicators of physiological stress and recovery. Optimal levels (high HRV, low RHR) are sought to ensure the body is not chronically overstressed by exercise or other factors.

**Chris' Biomarker Philosophy:**
*   Employs various wearables (Whoop, Oura Ring, Apple Watch) to track HRV, RHR, and sleep.
*   **VO2 Max:** Measured at 55, considered excellent.
*   **Marathon Training Impact:** Initiated marathon training, expecting an increase in VO2 max but monitoring for potential negative impacts on HRV and RHR, which could indicate physiological overstress.
*   **Alcohol Impact:** Observes significant negative impacts of alcohol on HRV and RHR, indicating a clear physiological stressor.

## Personal Routines and Challenges

**Crissman's Personal Experience:**
*   **Workout Intensity:** Has reduced workout volume (from 3-hour sessions) to optimize recovery and avoid injury, while still maintaining strength and fitness.
*   **Sleep Quality:** Made significant improvements in sleep quality (from 5% slow-wave sleep to nearly 25%) by shifting his eating window earlier in the day and adjusting dietary composition.
*   **Discipline:** Maintains a highly rigid diet and exercise schedule, viewing it as optimizing a "crop yield" for longevity.

**Chris' Personal Experience:**
*   **Weight Management:** Manages weight through periodic fasting rather than daily calorie restriction.
*   **Alcohol Consumption:** Acknowledges the negative impact of alcohol on his physiological markers (HRV, RHR) but integrates it into his routine.
*   **Training Philosophy:** Tends to "punch it and improve it over the long run" regarding exercise, sometimes pushing through suboptimal readiness metrics from wearables, believing in the body's ability to adapt.
*   **Travel and Environmental Factors:** Recognizes that external factors like uncomfortable beds during travel can also affect recovery metrics.
