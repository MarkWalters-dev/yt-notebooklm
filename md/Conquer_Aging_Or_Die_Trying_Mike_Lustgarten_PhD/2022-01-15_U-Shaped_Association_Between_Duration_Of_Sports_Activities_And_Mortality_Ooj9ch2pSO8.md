# 2022-01-15 U-Shaped Association Between Duration Of Sports Activities And Mortality

## Executive Summary

*   A U-shaped association between the duration of sports activities and all-cause mortality risk was observed in a study of approximately 8,800 individuals followed for up to 26 years.
*   The U-shaped association was statistically significant only in current and former smokers, not in never-smokers.
*   This U-shaped association was present in individuals with a BMI of 25 or greater (overweight and obese), but not in those with a normal BMI (18.5-24.9 kg/m²).
*   The U-shaped association was significant in men but not in women.
*   No significant U-shaped association was found in relation to age groups (younger than 60 or older than 60).

## Study Overview and Methodology

This study investigated the relationship between the weekly duration of sports activities and all-cause mortality risk.

*   **Participants:** Approximately 8,800 individuals with an average age of 57 years.
*   **Follow-up Period:** Up to 26 years.
*   **Physical Activity (PA) Categories:**
    *   Tennis
    *   Badminton
    *   Soccer
    *   Handball
    *   Cycling
    *   Swimming
    *   Jogging
    *   Calisthenics
    *   Health club activities
    *   Weightlifting
*   **Reference Group:** Individuals exercising 2.6 to 4.5 hours per week.
*   **Statistical Model:** Fully adjusted model, defined as the extended multivariate model, accounting for potential confounding variables.

## Key Findings: Association with All-Cause Mortality

The study identified a U-shaped association between the duration of sports activities and all-cause mortality risk.

*   **Low Physical Activity Levels:**
    *   Zero weekly exercise: 41% increase in all-cause mortality risk compared to the reference group.
    *   Up to 2.5 hours per week: 21% increase in all-cause mortality risk compared to the reference group.
*   **High Physical Activity Levels:**
    *   More than 10 hours per week: 22% increase in all-cause mortality risk compared to the reference group.

## Moderating Factors of the U-Shaped Association

The U-shaped association was not consistent across all subgroups.

### Smoking Status

The U-shaped association was significant only in current and former smokers.

*   **Current and Former Smokers:**
    *   Both lower (<2.5 hours/week) and higher (>4.5 hours/week) levels of weekly exercise were associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk when compared to the reference group.
*   **Never Smokers:**
    *   Less than 2.5 hours/week: Not significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   More than 4.6 hours/week: Not significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.

### Body Mass Index (BMI)

The U-shaped association was observed in overweight and obese individuals, but not in those with normal weight.

*   **Normal Weight (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m²):**
    *   Sedentary (0 hours/week): Increased all-cause mortality risk compared to the reference group.
    *   More than 4.6 hours/week: Not significantly increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Conclusion:** No U-shaped association in this group.
*   **Overweight and Obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²):**
    *   Less than 2.5 hours/week: Significant increase in all-cause mortality risk compared to the reference group.
    *   More than 4.6 hours/week: Significant increase in all-cause mortality risk compared to the reference group.
    *   **Conclusion:** U-shaped association observed in this group.

### Sex

The U-shaped association was significant in men but not in women.

*   **Women:**
    *   Sedentary (0 hours/week): Associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk compared to the reference group.
    *   More than 4.6 hours/week: Not significantly associated with mortality risk.
    *   **Conclusion:** No U-shaped association in women.
*   **Men:**
    *   Less than 2.5 hours/week: Significant increase in all-cause mortality risk compared to the reference group.
    *   Greater than 4.6 hours/week: Significantly increased all-cause mortality risk compared to the reference group.
    *   **Conclusion:** U-shaped association observed in men.

### Age

The U-shaped association was not significant in either age group.

*   **Younger than 60 years:**
    *   Sedentary (0 hours/week): Associated with increased all-cause mortality risk compared to the reference group.
    *   More than 4.6 hours/week: Not significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Conclusion:** No U-shaped association.
*   **Older than 60 years:**
    *   Less than 2.5 hours/week: Significant increase in all-cause mortality risk compared to the reference group.
    *   More than 4.6 hours/week: Did not have significant increases in all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Conclusion:** No U-shaped association.

## Summary of U-Shaped Association Applicability

The U-shaped association between sports activity duration and all-cause mortality risk was found to be significant only under specific conditions within this study:

*   **Significant:**
    *   Current and former smokers
    *   Individuals with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² (overweight and obese)
    *   Men
*   **Not Significantly Associated:**
    *   Never smokers
    *   Individuals with a BMI < 25 kg/m² (normal weight)
    *   Women
    *   Individuals younger than 60 years
    *   Individuals older than 60 years
