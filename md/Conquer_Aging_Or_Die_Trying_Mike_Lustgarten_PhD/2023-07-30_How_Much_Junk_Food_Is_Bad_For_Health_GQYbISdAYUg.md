# 2023-07-30 How Much Junk Food Is Bad For Health

## Executive Summary

*   Consuming more than one serving of ultra-processed food (UPF) per day is significantly associated with an increased risk of dementia.
*   High intake of UPF, around seven servings per day, can increase dementia risk by as much as five times compared to no UPF consumption.
*   UPF consumption is linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular events, including atherosclerosis, stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular mortality, starting at one serving per day.
*   More than approximately 1.75 servings of UPF per day are associated with a significant increase in all-cause mortality risk.

## Introduction to Ultra-Processed Foods (UPFs)

Ultra-processed food (UPF) is defined as an industrial formulation made with minimal or no whole foods and processed with additives such as flavorings or preservatives. Examples include soda, chips, cookies, chicken nuggets, and breakfast cereals.

## Associations with Dementia Risk

*   **Hazard Ratio for Dementia:** The data shows a significant association between UPF intake and the risk of all dementia (including Alzheimer's, vascular, and other dementias).
*   **Threshold for Significance:** Associations become significant at intakes of more than one serving of UPF per day.
*   **Dose-Response Relationship:** At higher intakes, the risk of dementia increases substantially. Individuals consuming close to seven servings of UPF per day had a five-fold higher risk of dementia compared to those consuming no UPF.

### Serving Size Definition for UPFs

The definition of a serving size for UPFs can vary significantly by food item, impacting calorie content per serving. Examples include:
*   Crackers: 20 calories per serving
*   Commercially baked cookie: 24 calories per serving
*   English muffin: 270 calories per serving
*   Hamburger: 427 calories per serving

## Associations with Cardiovascular Events and All-Cause Mortality

### Cardiovascular Events

*   **Increased Risk:** UPF consumption is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, including atherosclerosis, stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular mortality.
*   **Study Population:** This finding is based on a meta-analysis of eight studies involving over 278,000 participants.
*   **Serving Size Standardization:** For this analysis, one serving was standardized to 50 grams of UPF per day.
*   **Threshold for Significance:** A significant increased risk for cardiovascular events is observed at an intake of one serving of UPF per day.

### All-Cause Mortality

*   **Increased Risk:** UPF consumption is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality.
*   **Study Population:** This finding is based on a meta-analysis of nine studies involving over 296,000 participants.
*   **Threshold for Significance:** A significant increase in all-cause mortality risk is observed at approximately 1.75 servings of UPF per day.

## Conclusion on Junk Food Consumption

Based on the presented studies, consuming **more than one to two servings of ultra-processed food (junk food) per day** is associated with an increased risk for dementia, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality.
