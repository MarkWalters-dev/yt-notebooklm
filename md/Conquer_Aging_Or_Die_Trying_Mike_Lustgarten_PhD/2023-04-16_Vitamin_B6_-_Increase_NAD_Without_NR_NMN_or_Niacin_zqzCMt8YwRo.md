# 2023-04-16 Vitamin B6 - Increase NAD Without NR, NMN or Niacin

## Executive Summary

*   NAD levels decline with age.
*   While NR, NMN, and niacin are common NAD precursors, the tryptophan-to-NAD pathway may also be a significant contributor.
*   An age-related decline in Vitamin B6 (pyridoxal phosphate) appears to be a bottleneck in the tryptophan-to-NAD pathway, specifically in the conversion of 3-hydroxykynurenine to 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid.
*   Supplementation with Vitamin B6 may increase intracellular NAD levels.
*   The tolerable upper intake level for Vitamin B6 is 100 mg per day, with a recommended daily allowance of 1.3-1.7 mg per day.

## NAD Decline During Aging

NAD levels are observed to be higher in youth and decrease significantly in advanced age. This age-related decline is a known factor contributing to aging processes.

## NAD Synthesis Pathways

NAD can be synthesized through multiple pathways:

1.  **Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) and Niacin Pathway:**
    *   NR and Niacin (as nicotinic acid or nicotinamide) are converted into Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN).
    *   NMN is then further converted into NAD.

2.  **Tryptophan Pathway:**
    *   This pathway utilizes the amino acid tryptophan as a starting material.
    *   Tryptophan is converted into NAD through a series of enzymatic steps. This pathway is less commonly appreciated but may be crucial.

## Tryptophan to NAD Conversion Pathway

The conversion of tryptophan to NAD involves several key steps and intermediates:

Tryptophan
-> Kynurenine (catalyzed by IDO or TDO)
    *   TDO primarily converts dietary tryptophan in the liver.
    *   IDO converts tryptophan in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-alpha, Interferon gamma).
-> 3-hydroxykynurenine (HK) (requires Vitamin B2/Riboflavin)
-> 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (HAA) (requires Vitamin B6/Pyridoxal Phosphate)
-> ... (further steps lead to NAD)

## Age-Related Changes in Tryptophan Pathway Intermediates

*   **Kynurenine:** Plasma levels of kynurenine show an age-related increase in individuals aged 40 to 80 years.
*   **3-hydroxykynurenine (HK):** Plasma levels of HK also demonstrate an age-related increase over the same age range. This indicates that Vitamin B2 is likely not a limiting factor in its conversion.
*   **3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (HAA):** Plasma levels of HAA decline with aging in individuals aged 40 to 80 years. This observation suggests a potential bottleneck in the pathway.

## The Role of Vitamin B6

*   Vitamin B6, in its active form, pyridoxal phosphate, is essential for the conversion of 3-hydroxykynurenine (HK) into 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (HAA).
*   The observed age-related decline in HAA, coupled with the known requirement for Vitamin B6 in this conversion, points to Vitamin B6 deficiency as a potential cause of reduced NAD synthesis via the tryptophan pathway.
*   Studies show an age-related decline in plasma levels of pyridoxal phosphate across various age groups, from birth to 90 years, reinforcing this hypothesis.

## Vitamin B6 Supplementation and NAD Levels

*   **Potential for NAD Increase:** Based on the evidence, supplementing with Vitamin B6 may increase intracellular NAD levels by alleviating the bottleneck in the tryptophan-to-NAD pathway.
*   **Dosage Considerations:**
    *   **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL):** 100 mg per day.
    *   **Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA):** 1.3-1.7 mg per day (varies by age and gender).
*   **Personal Observation and Strategy:**
    *   Previous average Vitamin B6 intake was 3.2 mg/day.
    *   Increased intake to an average of 10.2 mg/day for a period preceding an upcoming blood test.
    *   The goal is to increase NAD and potentially homocysteine levels while gradually finding a minimal effective dose to avoid negative impacts on other biomarkers.
    *   NAD levels will be monitored using Genfinity testing.

## Future Monitoring

Data on NAD levels following increased Vitamin B6 intake will be presented in upcoming videos.
