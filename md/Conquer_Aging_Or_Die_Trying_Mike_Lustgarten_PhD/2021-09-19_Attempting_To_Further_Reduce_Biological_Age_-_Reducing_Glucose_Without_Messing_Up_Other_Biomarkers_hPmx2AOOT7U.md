# 2021-09-19 Attempting To Further Reduce Biological Age - Reducing Glucose Without Messing Up Other Biomarkers

## Executive Summary

*   Higher average daily fat intake is significantly correlated with higher fasting glucose levels.
*   Saturated fat intake appears to be the primary driver of the correlation between total fat intake and fasting glucose.
*   While Vitamin B12 supplementation showed a net positive correlation with several biomarkers, it was also positively correlated with higher glucose levels.
*   Omega-6 fat intake, primarily from whole foods like nuts and seeds, is negatively correlated with homocysteine and positively correlated with VLDL.
*   A planned dietary adjustment involving removing Vitamin B12 supplementation and limiting Omega-6 fat intake is projected to result in a net positive impact on biomarkers, including reduced glucose.

## Background: Glucose and All-Cause Mortality

*   Fasting glucose levels increase during aging for both men and women.
*   Lowest risk for all-cause mortality is observed when fasting glucose is between 80-94 mg/dL.
*   Fasting glucose levels of 95 mg/dL and higher are associated with a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   The speaker's current fasting glucose level of 95 mg/dL indicates a trend in the wrong direction regarding all-cause mortality risk.

## Dietary Factors Correlated with Higher Glucose

### Total Fat Intake
*   A moderate correlation (r=0.67) exists between average daily fat intake and fasting glucose levels.
*   This correlation is highly significant (p-value).

### Types of Fat Intake
*   Monounsaturated fat intake (MUFA) shows no statistically significant correlation with fasting glucose.
*   Omega-3 and Omega-6 fat intake show no significant correlation with fasting glucose.
*   Saturated fat intake shows a significant positive correlation with fasting glucose levels. The trend line is virtually identical to that of total fat intake, suggesting saturated fat may be the driving factor.

### Specific Food Sources of Saturated Fat
*   Data tracking daily food intake since July 2018 (17 blood tests during this period) identified top sources of saturated fat:
    *   Coconut butter
    *   Full fat mozzarella cheese
    *   Stonyfield yogurt (full fat plain yogurt)
    *   Sardines
    *   Cocoa beans
*   Of these five foods, only full-fat yogurt intake was significantly correlated with fasting glucose levels.
*   Replacing full-fat yogurt with low-fat yogurt (starting late 2020) did not significantly alter the correlation with glucose.

### Vitamin B12 Intake
*   A significantly positive correlation exists between average dietary Vitamin B12 intake and fasting glucose levels.
*   Vitamin B12 supplementation was initiated to limit homocysteine, which has been trending higher and is associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   Higher Vitamin B12 levels are significantly correlated with lower homocysteine levels.

#### Composite Biomarker Analysis for Vitamin B12
*   Analysis of 20 biomarkers across multiple organ systems (kidney, liver, lipoproteins, immune cells, red blood cells, inflammation, biological age score) over six years (up to 30 blood tests).
*   **Positive Correlations (Higher B12 -> Good Direction):**
    *   Lower AST (liver enzyme)
    *   Higher Platelets
    *   Higher Red Blood Cells
*   **Negative Correlations (Higher B12 -> Wrong Direction):**
    *   Higher Neutrophils
    *   Lower Lymphocyte percentage
    *   Higher Glucose
*   **Net Correlative Effect of B12:**
    *   Biomarkers going in the right direction: Homocysteine, AST, Platelets, Red Blood Cells (4)
    *   Biomarkers going in the wrong direction: Glucose, Neutrophils, Lymphocyte percentage (3)
    *   Net score: +1 (suggesting a small, positive beneficial effect).

### Omega-6 Fat Intake
*   A significant positive correlation exists between average daily Omega-6 fat intake and homocysteine levels.
*   Sources of Omega-6 are primarily whole foods (walnuts, pecans, other nuts/seeds), not seed oils.
*   **Correlation of Omega-6 with Glucose:** No significant correlation observed.
*   **Composite Biomarker Analysis for Omega-6:**
    *   **Positive Correlations (Higher Omega-6 -> Good Direction):**
        *   Lower VLDL (Very Low-Density Lipoprotein)
    *   **Negative Correlations (Higher Omega-6 -> Wrong Direction):**
        *   Higher AST
        *   Lower Platelets
        *   Lower Red Blood Cells
        *   Higher MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume)
*   **Net Correlative Effect of Higher Omega-6 Intake:**
    *   Biomarkers going in the wrong direction: Homocysteine, AST, Platelets, Red Blood Cells, MCV (5)
    *   Biomarkers going in the right direction: VLDL (1)
    *   Net score: -4 (suggesting a negative impact).

## Proposed Dietary Plan

1.  **Remove Vitamin B12 supplementation.**
2.  **Limit Omega-6 fat intake** to the lower end of the observed range (approximately 6 grams per day).

### Projected Outcomes of the Plan

*   **Glucose Reduction:** Reducing B12 and limiting Omega-6 is projected to lower blood glucose levels.
*   **Homocysteine Management:** While B12 reduction might theoretically increase homocysteine, limiting Omega-6 is correlated with higher homocysteine. The combined effect is anticipated to maintain or manage homocysteine levels.
*   **Net Biomarker Impact:**
    *   The removal of B12 is projected to have a net positive effect on biomarkers (estimated +1).
    *   Limiting Omega-6 is projected to have a net positive effect on biomarkers (estimated -4, meaning a reduction in negative impacts).
    *   The combined dietary changes are projected to result in an overall net positive score of +3 on biomarkers, including reduced glucose.

## Next Steps

*   Monitor biomarkers after implementing the dietary changes.
*   Data will be available for review in approximately one month.
