# 2026-01-25 Visceral Fat Removal Extends Lifespan - Who Has The Lowest

## Executive Summary
*   Surgical removal of visceral fat in rats significantly extended both median and maximal lifespan compared to control groups.
*   Calorie restriction (CR) extends lifespan longer than visceral fat removal alone, suggesting fat reduction is a mechanism contributing to CR's longevity benefits.
*   The speaker's recent Dexa scan (December 2025) revealed a Visceral Fat Mass (VFM) of 127g, which is approximately 10 times lower than the chronological age-expected median for a 53-year-old male (approx. 1300g).
*   Reducing total body weight by just 3 lbs over a year resulted in a greater than 50% reduction in the speaker's VFM, highlighting the sensitivity of VFM to small changes in leanness.
*   The speaker's lowest VFM (127g) correlated with their lowest Body Fat Percentage (11.9%) over a three-year tracking period.

## Animal Data: Visceral Fat Removal and Lifespan
Surgical removal of visceral fat in rats demonstrated a significant extension of lifespan compared to control animals.

*   **Median Lifespan:** Visceral fat removal extended the median lifespan, although the longest extension was achieved via 40% Calorie Restriction (CR).
*   **Maximal Lifespan:** Visceral fat removal also extended the maximal lifespan, again surpassed only by CR.
*   **Implication:** Calorie restriction reduces visceral fat, suggesting that visceral fat reduction is a mechanism that contributes to the overall lifespan-extending effects of CR.

## Speaker's Personal Visceral Fat Tracking (3-Year Analysis)

The speaker tracked VFM via Dexa scans performed annually in December over three years (2023, 2024, 2025).

### Standardization of Testing Protocol
To minimize test-to-test variability across all measurements (Dexa, glucose, ketones):
*   Testing is standardized to the same time of year (December, around the 15th-20th).
*   Fasting is standardized: Almost all food intake is consumed by 8:00 a.m., resulting in a 3-4 hour window with no food or water before testing.
*   For Dexa: When measuring immediately one after the other (e.g., in 2024), the two measurements were averaged to account for variability (e.g., 0.8 lbs and 0.59 lbs in 2024).

### VFM Progression (December Data)
| Year | VFM (lbs) | VFM (grams) | Body Weight (Morning) | Body Fat % (BF%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2023 | 0.58 | 263 g | 140.5 lbs | 14.0% |
| 2024 | Avg of 0.8 & 0.59 | 316 g | 141.4 lbs | 15.45% |
| 2025 | 0.28 | 127 g | 138.8 lbs | 11.9% |

### Comparison to Age-Expected Data (Men, Age ~53)
*   The chronological age-expected median VFM is approximately 1,300 grams.
*   The speaker's 2025 measurement of 127 g is about 10 times lower than the expected median.
*   This 127 g measurement places the speaker at the lowest percentile level for visceral fat for any age group dating back to 20 years old on the population-based comparison graph.
*   The goal is to avoid the typical age-related increase in VFM; the 2025 result reverses the negative trend seen in 2024.

## Factors Influencing Visceral Fat Reduction

### 1. Body Weight Correlation
A very narrow 3-pound range in body weight correlated strongly with large fluctuations in VFM.
*   Highest Body Weight (141.4 lbs in 2024) corresponded with Highest VFM (316 g).
*   Lowest Body Weight (138.8 lbs in 2025) corresponded with Lowest VFM (127 g).
*   **Finding:** A small 1 lb increase in body weight correlated with an increase in VFM, and losing 3 lbs resulted in cutting VFM by more than half relative to the highest value.

### 2. Body Fat Percentage (BF%) Correlation
Population data shows a strong positive association between increasing BF% and higher VFM.
*   **Finding:** When the speaker's BF% was at its highest (15.45% in 2024), VFM was also highest (316 g). When BF% was lowest (11.9% in 2025), VFM was lowest (127 g).
*   **Conclusion:** Reducing body fat percentage appears critical for reducing VFM.

### 3. Specific Dietary Components

The speaker analyzed full-year average intake for certain nutrients across the three testing years against VFM results.

*   **Walnut Consumption:**
    *   Study cited: High walnut intake associated with a 90% reduction in VFM.
    *   Speaker Data: Lowest VFM (127 g in 2025) occurred when average daily walnut intake was highest (18 g/day in 2025). Highest VFM (316 g in 2024) correlated with the lowest walnut intake (7 g/day in 2024).
    *   *Note: Causation is unproven, but correlation is present.*

*   **Dietary Fiber Intake:**
    *   Study cited: Highest quartile of increasing fiber intake associated with about a 15% reduction in VFM.
    *   Speaker Data (Grams/Day): 85 g (2023), 84 g (2024), 82 g (2025).
    *   *Finding: No specific trend seen; fiber intake does not appear to be a factor in the VFM reduction observed in the most recent test.*

*   **Green Tea Consumption:**
    *   Study cited: More green tea consumption associated with about a 13% reduction in VFM.
    *   Speaker Data: Intake has been constant (~10 g/day, 2 cups/day) over the three years.
    *   *Finding: As intake is constant, this likely was not the driver for the recent reduction.*

## Comparison with Longevity Community Figures (VFM in Grams)
The speaker compared their 127 g result to publicly reported data from others in the longevity space (as of the recording date).

| Individual | Age (at Test) | VFM (grams) | Metric/Method | Comparison to Speaker (127g) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Speaker (Recent) | ~53 | 127 g | Dexa | Baseline |
| Brian Johnson | 48 (Aug 2025) | 504 g | MRI | ~4 times higher |
| Paul Saladino | 46 (Dec 2023) | 136 g | Reported | Slightly higher (but close) |
| Dave Pasco | >50 (3 yrs prior) | 141 g | Reported | Slightly higher (expected to be lower now) |
| Seamland | Unknown | 54 g | Reported | Significantly lower |

*   **Dietary Note:** The speaker highlights that both Brian Johnson (vegan) and Paul Saladino (non-vegan) have achieved very low VFM, suggesting low visceral fat levels are achievable across drastically different dietary approaches.
