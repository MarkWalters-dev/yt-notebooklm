# 2022-03-20 Quantifying Biological Age - Blood Test 2 in 2022

## Executive Summary

*   The author's current biological age, calculated using Morgan Levine's phenotypic age calculator with nine biomarkers, is 35.4 years, which is 13.7 years younger than their chronological age.
*   Over the past few years, there has been a trend of decreasing biological age. The average biological age in 2020 and 2021 was 35.6 years, while the first two tests in 2022 show an average of 34 years.
*   Using the aging.ai calculator with 19 biomarkers, the author's biological age is 28 years, representing a 21.1-year reduction from their chronological age.
*   Since implementing daily diet tracking in April 2015, the author's average aging.ai biological age has decreased from 32 years (pre-diet tracking) to 29.8 years.
*   The first two tests in 2022 show an even greater reduction in biological age, with an average of 27 years according to aging.ai.

## Phenotypic Age (Morgan Levine)

### Current Biological Age Calculation

*   **Biomarkers Used:** 9 (as defined by Morgan Levine's phenotypic age calculator)
*   **Calculated Phenotypic Age:** 35.4 years
*   **Chronological Age Difference:** -13.7 years (biological age is younger than chronological age)

**Note on High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP):**
*   Quest's hs-CRP measurement limit of detection is <0.3 mg/L.
*   The author's value was below this limit, meaning the actual value could be lower than 0.3 mg/L. This suggests the calculated phenotypic age of 35.4 years might be slightly better.

### Historical Trend of Phenotypic Age

*   **2018-2019:** 3 blood tests, average biological age: 36.1 years (average reduction of 11.9 years)
*   **2020:** 6 blood tests, average biological age: 35.6 years
*   **2021:** 6 blood tests, average biological age: 35.6 years
*   **2022 (so far):** 2 blood tests, average biological age: 34 years (average reduction of 15 years)

**Observation:** The author has experienced a further 3-year reduction in average biological age in 2022 compared to the period from 2018-2021.

**Limitation of Phenotypic Age:**
*   Phenotypic Age includes chronological age in its model, which limits the maximum potential reduction in biological age to approximately 20 years.

## Aging.ai Biological Age

### Current Biological Age Calculation

*   **Biomarkers Used:** 19 (standard chemistry panel and complete blood count)
*   **Calculated Aging.ai Age:** 28 years
*   **Chronological Age Difference:** -21.1 years (biological age is younger than chronological age)

**Note on Data Set:** The North American data set was used for calculation, as the author has always resided in the United States.

### Historical Trend of Aging.ai Age

*   **2009-2013 (Pre-Diet Tracking):** 3 blood tests, average age: 32 years (approx. 5-year period)
*   **April 2015 - Present (Post-Diet Tracking):** 28 tests, average age: 29.8 years

**Diet Tracking Methodology:**
*   Weighing all food daily.
*   Entering food amounts into an online nutrition app.
*   Recording diet data into an Excel file.
*   Analyzing correlations between blood test data and diet data.
*   Optimizing blood biomarkers through dietary adjustments.

### 2022 Aging.ai Results

*   **First Test (2022):** 26 years old (approx. 4 years younger than the 7-year average of 29.8 years)
*   **Second Test (2022):** 28 years old (approx. 2 years younger than the 7-year average of 29.8 years)

**Observation:** The first two tests in 2022 show a further reduction in biological age according to aging.ai, with an average of 27 years, indicating a positive trend.
