# 2025-11-19 The Waist-To-Hip Ratio Modifies LP a -Associated CVD Risk

## Executive Summary

*   Lipoprotein A (Lp(a)) is six times more atherogenic than LDL cholesterol.
*   High Lp(a) (≥ 50 mg/dL) is associated with increased atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, but this association is significantly modified by waist-to-hip ratio (WHR).
*   A WHR of 1.0 or higher in individuals with high Lp(a) is associated with a significantly higher cumulative incidence of ASCVD events compared to those with low Lp(a) and the same WHR.
*   For individuals with high Lp(a), achieving a WHR below 0.93 appears to mitigate the increased ASCVD risk, regardless of Lp(a) levels.
*   Strategies to reduce Lp(a)-associated CVD risk may include weight loss to reduce waist circumference and strength training to maintain or increase hip circumference, aiming for a WHR < 0.93.

## Lipoprotein A vs. LDL-C Atherogenicity

*   The genetic effect on coronary heart disease (CHD) risk plotted against the genetic effect on ApoB, specifically when ApoB is attached to LDL or Lp(a).
*   When ApoB is derived from Lp(a), the associated risk for CHD is six times higher compared to when ApoB is derived from LDL. This reinforces that Lp(a) is significantly more atherogenic than LDL.

## Factors Modifying Lp(a)-Associated CVD Risk

### Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR)

This study investigates how WHR modifies the risk of ASCVD events associated with Lp(a).

**Study Design & Definitions:**

*   **ASCVD Events Included:** Myocardial infarction, resuscitation from cardiac arrest, coronary heart disease, angina, and stroke.
*   **Follow-up Period:** Up to 20 years.
*   **Groups:**
    *   **Lp(a) Levels:**
        *   Low Lp(a): < 50 mg/dL (represented in blue)
        *   High Lp(a): ≥ 50 mg/dL (represented in red)
    *   **Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR):**
        *   Low WHR: Average of 0.83
        *   Intermediate WHR: Average of 0.93
        *   High WHR: Average of 1.0

**Data Analysis:**

*   **Low WHR (Average 0.83):**
    *   Cumulative incidence curves for ASCVD events between low Lp(a) and high Lp(a) groups overlapped.
    *   Conclusion: No significant difference in cumulative incidence rate for individuals with high or low Lp(a) when combined with a low WHR (0.83).
*   **Intermediate WHR (Average 0.93):**
    *   Cumulative incidence curves for ASCVD events between low Lp(a) and high Lp(a) groups overlapped.
    *   Conclusion: No significant difference in cumulative incidence rates whether someone had low or high Lp(a) with an intermediate WHR (0.93).
*   **High WHR (Average 1.0):**
    *   Cumulative incidence curves showed separation between low Lp(a) and high Lp(a) groups.
    *   Log rank P value indicated a significant difference.
    *   Conclusion: Cumulative incidence rates of ASCVD events were significantly higher in people with high Lp(a) (≥ 50 mg/dL) and a high WHR (1.0) compared to those with low Lp(a) (< 50 mg/dL) and the same high WHR.

### High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP)

*   Low levels of hs-CRP are suggested to mediate Lp(a)-associated CVD risk. (Detailed explanation was covered in a previous video and not included in this transcript).

## Implications and Recommendations

*   **For individuals with Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL:**
    *   **Reduce waist circumference:** Aim for weight loss to decrease waist size, a component of WHR.
    *   **Optimize hip circumference:** Engage in regular strength training, including compound movements like squats and deadlifts, to resist age-related decline in hip circumference.
    *   **Target WHR:** Aim for a WHR of less than 0.93.
*   **WHR < 0.93:** This WHR appears to be protective, as it was not associated with increased ASCVD risk regardless of Lp(a) levels in this study.
