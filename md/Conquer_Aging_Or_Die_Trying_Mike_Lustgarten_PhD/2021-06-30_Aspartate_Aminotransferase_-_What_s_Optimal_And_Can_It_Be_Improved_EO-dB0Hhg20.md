# 2021-06-30 Aspartate Aminotransferase - What s Optimal And Can It Be Improved

## Executive Summary
*   The standard reference range for Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) (0-40 IU/L) is likely not optimal for longevity, as centenarian studies show lower average levels (around 21.3).
*   All-cause mortality risk is minimized when AST levels fall between 15 and 24 IU/L; levels below 15 IU/L or above 25 IU/L are associated with increased risk.
*   Liver disease mortality risk is significantly reduced (64% decrease) in individuals with AST $<15$ IU/L compared to the 15-24 IU/L reference group, but higher AST values ($>24$ IU/L) show extremely high mortality increases (up to 73-fold).
*   For individuals, an AST level in the 15-24 IU/L range is associated with the longest life expectancy across age groups in large observational studies.
*   Personal dietary tracking showed a strong negative correlation between high Beta Cryptoxanthin intake and AST levels, suggesting dietary modification could be a strategy for improvement.

## AST Biomarker Overview

AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) is an intracellular protein produced in the liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and heart. Elevated levels in the blood reflect cellular damage.

**AST Metabolic Function (Reversible Reaction):**
Aspartate + Alpha Ketoglutarate $\rightleftharpoons$ Glutamate + Oxaloacetate

**Standard Reference Range (LabCorp):**
0 to 40 IU/L

## AST and Aging Data

AST levels change significantly with age:
1.  **Youth (Starting at age 20):** AST values are approximately 20 IU/L for both sexes.
2.  **Mid-Life:** AST increases for both men and women, reaching approximately 30 IU/L around age 60.
3.  **Older Age (Up to 85+):** Levels remain flat around 30 IU/L.
4.  **Centenarians (Median age 100):** Average AST is significantly lower at 21.3 IU/L.

**Aging Curve Trend:** AST generally increases through mid-life and then decreases in extreme old age, suggesting the optimal level may not align with the typical mid-life maximum.

## AST and Mortality Risk

Data from a large study ($>416,000$ subjects) assessing hazard ratios (HR) for all-cause mortality, using AST 15–24 IU/L as the reference:

| AST Range (IU/L) | All-Cause Mortality HR | Key Finding |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| $<15$ | Increased Risk (HR=1.39) | 39% increased risk. |
| $15-24$ | 1.0 (Reference) | Optimal range for all-cause mortality. |
| $25-39$ | Increased Risk | |
| $40-69$ | Increased Risk (HR $\approx 1.96$ or higher) | 96% increased risk. |
| $>70$ | Significantly Increased Risk (Nearly 4-fold) | |

### Liver Disease Mortality Risk

Comparing AST ranges against the 15–24 IU/L reference for liver disease mortality (including cancer and cirrhosis):

*   **AST $<15$:** Associated with a significantly **decreased risk** (HR = 0.36), representing a 64% reduction in death from liver disease.
*   **AST $\ge 25$:** Associated with very high increases in risk, even within the standard reference range (e.g., 25–39 group had a 5-fold increase).
*   **AST 40–69:** 27-fold increased risk for liver disease mortality.
*   **AST $>70$:** 73-fold increased risk for liver disease mortality.

### Cancer Risk Association

The increased all-cause mortality risk observed for AST $<15$ (despite decreased liver disease risk) is linked to non-liver cancers:
*   **AST $<15$:** Showed a 33% increased risk of non-liver cancer, resulting in an overall 27% increased cancer risk. Liver cancer risk was very low in this group.
*   **AST $>24$:** Associated with increased risk for both overall cancer and liver cancer (5.3-fold higher risk compared to the 15–24 reference group).

### Life Expectancy Data

Longest average life expectancy was observed in the AST 15–24 IU/L group across all ages studied (men and women).

Example for 30-year-olds compared to the 15–24 group (expected to live to $\approx 83$):
*   **AST 25–39:** $\approx 1$ year shorter life expectancy.
*   **AST 40–69:** $\approx 7.5$ years shorter life expectancy.
*   **AST $>70$:** Up to 17 years shorter life expectancy.

### Very Large Cohort Confirmation

In a study involving over 16.6 million people, where a median value of 20 was the reference:
*   Median AST values of 21 and 23 showed significantly **decreased** all-cause mortality risk.
*   A median AST of 27 resulted in a 30% increased all-cause mortality risk (HR 1.3).

## Personal Dietary Correlation Analysis

The speaker tracked AST alongside detailed dietary intake data since 2015 to identify correlations.

### AST Trend Over Time (Personal Data)
*   **2008–2013 (Pre-tracking):** Average AST $\approx 24.3$.
*   **2015–2021 (Tracking):** Average AST increased to $30.5$, approaching 40 in early 2017. Recent efforts have lowered the average of the last seven measurements to 27.1.

### Beta Cryptoxanthin Correlation
Of 40 tracked nutrients, **Beta Cryptoxanthin** showed the strongest correlation with AST (Coefficient $R=0.7$).
*   **Trend:** Higher Beta Cryptoxanthin intake correlated with **higher** AST (moving in the wrong direction).
*   **Context:** Higher blood levels of Beta Cryptoxanthin are correlated with younger epigenetic age.
*   **Intervention:** The speaker reduced intake of high-density sources (e.g., butternut squash) and increased lower-density sources (e.g., red bell peppers) to aim for approximately $2,000 \mu\text{g}$ per day.

### Net Effect of Reducing Beta Cryptoxanthin Intake
Reducing Beta Cryptoxanthin was analyzed against four other biomarkers:

| Biomarker | Correlation with *Higher* $\beta$-Cryptoxanthin | Expected Effect of *Reduction* | Direction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Homocysteine | Strong Positive ($R=0.79$) | Lower levels | Favorable |
| Red Blood Cells (RBC) | Significant Negative | Higher levels | Favorable |
| Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) | Moderate Positive ($R=0.5$) | Lower levels | Favorable |
| Glucose | Significant Negative | Higher levels | Unfavorable |
| Triglycerides | Correlated with Lower Glucose/Triglycerides | Higher levels | Unfavorable |

**Net Assessment:** Reducing Beta Cryptoxanthin intake is correlated with favorable changes in 3-4 biomarkers (Homocysteine, RBC, MCV) but potentially unfavorable changes in 2 (Glucose, Triglycerides), resulting in a net positive assessment based on the observed data ($+2$ net biomarkers moving favorably).

**No significant correlations ($|R|<0.24$) were found** between Beta Cryptoxanthin and other tested biomarkers, including creatinine, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, white blood cells, lymphocyte percentage, RDW, hsCRP, phenotypic age, or HDL.
