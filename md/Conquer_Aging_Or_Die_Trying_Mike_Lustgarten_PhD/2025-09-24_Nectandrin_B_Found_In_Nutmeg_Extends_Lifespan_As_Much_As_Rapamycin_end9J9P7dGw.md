# 2025-09-24 Nectandrin B Found In Nutmeg Extends Lifespan As Much As Rapamycin

## Executive Summary

*   N-acetylcysteine (NAC) significantly increased the maximal lifespan of fruit flies (*Drosophila*).
*   The lifespan extension observed with NAC in fruit flies was comparable to that of rapamycin.
*   This effect was consistent in both male and female fruit flies.
*   NAC has also been shown to prevent cellular senescence in fibroblasts.
*   The optimal dosage of NAC or nutmeg for health benefits is currently unknown.

## N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and Fruit Fly Lifespan

### Study Methodology

*   Male and female fruit flies (*Drosophila*) were divided into three groups:
    *   Control
    *   Rapamycin-treated
    *   NAC-treated
*   Lifespan was measured in days, with percent survival plotted on the y-axis.
*   Two metrics for lifespan extension were analyzed:
    *   **Median survival:** The time when 50% of the flies have died.
    *   **Maximal lifespan:** The time when only 20% of the flies are still alive (indicated by 20% survival).

### Findings in Fruit Flies

*   **Median Survival:** Both rapamycin and NAC showed a minor, insignificant impact on median survival in fruit flies.
*   **Maximal Lifespan:**
    *   Both rapamycin and NAC led to a significant extension of maximal lifespan.
    *   The extent of lifespan extension by NAC was comparable to that achieved by rapamycin.
*   **Gender Consistency:** The observed effects on median and maximal lifespan were similar in both male and female fruit flies.

## NAC and Cellular Senescence

### Fibroblast Studies

*   In another study, NAC was found to prevent cellular senescence in fibroblasts.
*   Fibroblasts are important cells found in skin, ligaments, tendons, and cartilage.
*   This suggests potential benefits of NAC for connective tissues and organ systems where fibroblasts are prevalent.

## Future Considerations

*   The optimal dosage of NAC or nutmeg to achieve health benefits is currently unknown.
*   Incorporating nutmeg as a source of NAC, rather than consuming none, may be beneficial.
