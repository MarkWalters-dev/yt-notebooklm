# 2024-10-16 Red Light Therapy Improves Mitochondria Function Eye Health And Lifespan - Glen Jeffery PhD

## Executive Summary

*   Red light therapy, specifically wavelengths around 615-900nm, can recharge mitochondria, increasing ATP production and energy within cells.
*   Mitochondrial function, supported by red light therapy, is crucial for eye health and can improve vision metrics.
*   Studies in flies and bees demonstrate that red light therapy can increase average lifespan and improve motor function, by improving the health of middle-aged individuals within the population.
*   Blue light (420-450nm), conversely, can negatively impact mitochondrial function, leading to increased weight gain and potential diabetic conditions in animal models.
*   Exposure to deep red light (850nm) can be integrated into the built environment, potentially improving metabolic health and acting as a public health intervention for an aging population.

## Introduction to Mitochondria and Aging

*   Mitochondria are the "batteries" of our cells, responsible for generating energy (ATP).
*   As we age, mitochondrial function declines, leading to decreased ATP production and increased inflammation due to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
*   This decline in mitochondrial function is linked to age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and macular degeneration.
*   Organs with high energy demands, like the retina and brain, are particularly susceptible to age-related mitochondrial decline.

## The Role of Light in Mitochondrial Function

*   **Evolutionary Context:** Humans evolved under natural sunlight, which contains a broad spectrum of light, including deep red and near-infrared wavelengths that penetrate the body.
*   **Mitochondrial Absorption:** Mitochondria absorb specific wavelengths of light:
    *   **Red Light (approx. 615-900nm):** Recharges mitochondria, increasing ATP production. This effect is observed in the visible red spectrum (e.g., 670nm) and extends into the invisible near-infrared.
    *   **Blue Light (approx. 420-450nm):** Can partially discharge the mitochondrial battery, leading to less ATP.
*   **Natural Balance:** Sunlight provides a natural balance of red and blue light, which is crucial for optimal cellular function. Modern artificial lighting, particularly LEDs, is often heavily weighted towards blue wavelengths and lacks sufficient deep red and near-infrared light.

## Evidence from Animal Studies

### Mouse Data

*   **ATP Increase:** Exposure to 670nm red light increased ATP levels in the retinas and brains (cortex and thalamus) of mice.
*   **Retinal Function:** Red light exposure improved retinal function in older mice, as measured by the amplitude of retinal signals, bringing them closer to levels seen in younger mice.
*   **Systemic Signaling:** Red light exposure in mice led to changes in blood cytokine profiles, indicating a systemic effect of light therapy on immune markers associated with improved mitochondrial function and overall health.
*   **Blue Light Effects:** Mice exposed to blue light (420-450nm) showed significantly increased weight gain and signs of becoming diabetic compared to control groups.

### Fly and Bumblebee Data

*   **Fly Lifespan and Function:**
    *   A burst of red light in young flies increased their average lifespan by approximately 40% at older ages, eroding middle-aged deaths.
    *   Red light therapy improved locomotor function (climbing ability) in older flies.
    *   Cognitive ability, as measured by navigation in a water maze, was significantly improved in old flies after red light exposure.
    *   Memory function, assessed by the ability to learn to avoid quinine-lined tubes, was also enhanced in old flies following red light treatment.
*   **Bumblebee and Insecticide Resistance:**
    *   Red light therapy (670nm) protected bumblebees from the negative effects of the insecticide Imidacloprid, which targets mitochondria and induces Parkinson's-like symptoms.
    *   Red light exposure improved the survival rate and lifespan of bees treated with Imidacloprid.
    *   Interestingly, even without the insecticide, red light exposure extended the lifespan of bees, with effects persisting for a period after the light exposure ceased. This suggests a potential long-term benefit from early exposure.

## Human Evidence

### Visual Acuity

*   **Threshold Improvement:** A single 3-minute exposure to red light significantly improved visual detection thresholds (the ability to see fainter or smaller details) in human subjects, by approximately 17%. This effect was more pronounced for blue light detection, as the blue visual pathway is more fragile.
*   **Duration of Effect:** The benefits of a single red light exposure lasted for approximately one week.
*   **Deep Red Light:** Exposure to deeper red light (850nm) also improved blood glucose levels and visual function.

### Metabolic Health

*   **Blood Glucose Regulation:**
    *   In bumblebees, red light (670nm) led to a greater reduction in blood glucose levels compared to blue light.
    *   In humans, a burst of red light applied to the back reduced the spike in blood glucose levels after a glucose load and increased CO2 production, indicating increased oxygen and glucose utilization by mitochondria.
    *   Exposure to deep red light (850nm) also showed improvements in blood glucose levels.
*   **Potential Public Health Intervention:** The ability to integrate deep red light into the built environment without conscious awareness could offer a novel approach to managing blood sugar and improving metabolic health.

## The Impact of Modern Lighting

*   **Evolutionary Mismatch:** Modern LED lighting is heavily skewed towards blue wavelengths and lacks the deep red and near-infrared light present in natural sunlight. This represents a significant evolutionary mismatch.
*   **Blue Light Concerns:**
    *   Blue light (420-450nm) has been shown to negatively impact mitochondrial function.
    *   Studies show blue light exposure can significantly affect the cardiovascular system, leading to reduced blood pressure and increased heart rate.
    *   Long-term exposure to blue-rich lighting may contribute to metabolic issues and aging.
*   **"Modern Scurvy":** The lack of deep red light in our built environments is likened to "modern scurvy" – a deficiency in a crucial element for health.
*   **Building Design:** Architects and lighting engineers are increasingly focused on "healthy lighting," recognizing the detrimental effects of current lighting standards. Infrared-blocking glass in buildings further exacerbates the lack of beneficial long wavelengths.

## Future Directions and Unanswered Questions

*   **Optimal Wavelengths and Dosages:** Further research is needed to pinpoint the most effective wavelengths and optimal exposure times for various health outcomes.
*   **Timing of Exposure:** Red light therapy appears to be most effective in the morning, potentially due to circadian rhythms and the body's readiness to utilize energy.
*   **Firelight's Role:** The role of firelight, which contains significant infrared radiation, in human evolution and its potential health benefits is an area of ongoing interest.
*   **Cellular Communication via Light:** Emerging research suggests that cells can communicate with each other using light signals, a phenomenon that could have profound implications for understanding biological processes.
*   **Integration into Daily Life:** Developing unobtrusive and affordable ways to incorporate beneficial light wavelengths into homes and workplaces is a key goal.
*   **Early Intervention:** For degenerative conditions like macular degeneration, early intervention with red light therapy is critical for efficacy. There appears to be a "window" for optimal treatment.
*   **Mitochondrial Disease Treatment:** Red light therapy is being explored as a treatment for children with mitochondrial diseases, showing promising results in improving muscle function and overall health.

## Key Takeaways
