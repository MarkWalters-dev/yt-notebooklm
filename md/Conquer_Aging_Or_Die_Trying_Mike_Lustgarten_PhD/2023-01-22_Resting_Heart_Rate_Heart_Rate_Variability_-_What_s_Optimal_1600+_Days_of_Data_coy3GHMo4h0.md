# 2023-01-22 Resting Heart Rate Heart Rate Variability - What s Optimal 1600+ Days of Data

## Executive Summary

*   Resting heart rate (RHR) generally increases with age up to around 50 years, then declines into advanced age, while heart rate variability (HRV) consistently declines with age.
*   A relatively low RHR combined with a relatively high HRV is indicative of cardiovascular youth, while a low RHR with low HRV can indicate advanced age.
*   Personal data over 1600+ days shows a consistent reduction in RHR and an overall increase in HRV, suggesting a resistance to age-related decline and a potentially more youthful cardiovascular state.
*   Body weight is significantly correlated with RHR and HRV; lower body weight is associated with lower RHR and higher HRV.
*   Daily physical activity and overall stress (indexed by average daily heart rate) are significantly correlated with next-day RHR and HRV; higher daily activity/stress leads to higher next-day RHR and lower next-day HRV.

## Introduction: RHR & HRV Basics

Resting heart rate (RHR) and heart rate variability (HRV) provide insight into the integration between the nervous system, adrenal gland, and heart.

**Biological Process:**
Sympathetic Nerve Activity -> Adrenal Gland -> Norepinephrine & Epinephrine Release -> Impacts RHR & HRV
Parasympathetic Nerve Activity (Vagus Nerve) -> Impacts RHR & HRV

What constitutes optimal RHR and HRV, and how do these metrics change during aging?

## Resting Heart Rate Changes with Age

Data from Whoop (ages 20-50 years) shows that average RHR increases for both men and women.

A published study of over 90,000 Fitbit users, covering ages up to 85 years, corroborates the age-related increase in RHR up to approximately 50 years. Beyond 50, RHR then declines up to 85 years. This trend indicates that relatively low RHR values can be found in both young individuals and those of advanced age.

## Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Explained

HRV is defined as the variability in the time between consecutive heartbeats. For example, a heart rate of 60 beats per minute doesn't mean the heart beats exactly once per second; the precise intervals might vary (e.g., 859 ms, 793 ms, 726 ms). This variability is calculated as HRV. Whoop specifically uses the Root Mean Squared of Successive Differences (RMSSD) as its HRV metric.

## Heart Rate Variability Changes with Age

A study of over 8.2 million Fitbit users shows how RMSSD changes with age (20-60 years).
HRV values recorded at 6 AM are generally higher than those recorded at 6 PM. Focusing on morning data (as Whoop provides sleep-averaged morning HRV), HRV consistently declines with age for both men and women.

To differentiate if a relatively low RHR indicates youth or aging, HRV provides context:
*   **Youth:** Relatively low RHR + Relatively high HRV
*   **Advanced Age:** Relatively low RHR + Relatively low HRV

## Personal Data: Resting Heart Rate Trends

Personal data collected since August 2018 (over 1600 days) shows the following average yearly RHR (beats per minute - BPM):

*   **2018 (partial year):** 50.9 BPM
*   **2019:** 48.9 BPM (Significantly reduced vs. 2018, p < 0.05)
*   **2020:** 48.1 BPM (Significantly reduced vs. 2018, also significantly reduced vs. 2019)
*   **2021:** 47.4 BPM (Significantly lower vs. 2018, also significantly lower vs. 2020)
*   **2022:** 45.0 BPM (Significantly lower vs. 2018, also significantly lower vs. 2021)
*   **2023 (first 14 days):** 44.5 BPM (Significantly lower vs. 2018, just outside significance vs. 2022)

This consistent reduction in RHR from 2018 to 2023 indicates resistance to the expected age-related increase for an individual approaching 50 years old. It's also possible that this sustained reduction may reflect an early experience of the age-related RHR decline observed in older populations.

## Personal Data: Heart Rate Variability Trends

Personal data for RMSSD (milliseconds) since August 2018 shows:

*   **2018 (partial year):** 47.3 ms
*   **2019:** 56.2 ms (Significantly increased vs. 2018, p < 0.05)
*   **2020:** 57.8 ms (Significantly better vs. 2018, not significantly different vs. 2019, p = 0.07)
*   **2021:** 51.9 ms (Regression; better vs. 2018, but significantly worse vs. 2020)
*   **2022:** 59.3 ms (Significant improvement vs. 2018, also significant increase vs. 2021; successfully reversed 2021 trend)
*   **2023 (first 14 days):** 62.4 ms (Significantly better vs. 2018, just outside significance vs. 2022)

While not a consistent increase due to the dip in 2021, HRV has increased from 2018 to 2022. Compared to age-related population averages, the current HRV range of 59-62 ms is significantly above the expected median for an individual approaching 50 years old (median 35.1 ms). This suggests a HRV comparable to someone approximately 22 years younger, potentially indicating a youthful heart.

In summary, the combination of a relatively high HRV (59-62 ms) and a low RHR (44-45 BPM) suggests cardiovascular youth, contrasting with the lower HRV (35 ms) and higher RHR (approx. 57 BPM) expected based on chronological age.

## Factors Influencing RHR & HRV

### Body Weight

Daily body weight measurements over 1600+ days show a significant relationship with both RHR and HRV.

*   **Body Weight and RHR:** Monthly average body weight trends often mirrored monthly average RHR trends. Periods of body weight decrease corresponded to decreased RHR, and periods of body weight increase corresponded to increased RHR. A significant positive correlation exists between daily body weight and daily RHR: as body weight increases, RHR significantly increases. Conversely, as body weight approached 149 pounds, RHR approached 45 BPM.
*   **Body Weight and HRV:** During periods of body weight decrease, HRV tended to increase. Conversely, when body weight increased, HRV decreased. A significant negative (inverse) correlation exists between daily body weight and daily HRV: as body weight increases, HRV significantly decreases. Conversely, as body weight approached 149 pounds (the lightest recorded), HRV approached 60 ms.

The data suggests that both RHR and HRV approach youthful values as body weight decreases. A goal for 2023 is to further reduce body weight below 149 pounds to observe continued impacts on these metrics.

### Physical Activity & Stress (Average Daily Heart Rate - ADHR)

The average daily heart rate (ADHR) serves as an index of overall daily physical activity and/or stress. A higher ADHR indicates more physical activity and/or greater overall stress. Data covering approximately 1000 days reveals correlations with next-day RHR and HRV.

*   **ADHR and Next-Day RHR:** A significant positive correlation exists between ADHR and next-day RHR. A higher ADHR is significantly correlated with a higher next-day RHR, implying that too much daily activity or frequent stress negatively impacts RHR.
*   **ADHR and Next-Day HRV:** A significant negative (inverse) correlation exists between ADHR and next-day HRV. A higher ADHR is significantly correlated with a lower next-day HRV, suggesting that excessive daily activity or frequent stress negatively impacts HRV.

Finding a balance between active and rest days is crucial for optimizing RHR and HRV.

### Activity and Recovery Protocol

The following protocol is used to balance activity and recovery:

*   **Workout Schedule:** Two 80-minute full-body workouts per week.
*   **Recovery Pattern:**
    *   Following a workout (indexed by an average daily heart rate of 59 BPM), there are three consecutive days of relatively lower overall activity (e.g., ADHR of 53, 55, and 54 BPM). These are intentional days to allow RHR and HRV to fully recover.
    *   The next workout occurs on day four.
    *   Following this second workout, activity is titrated down for two days before the next workout on day three.
*   **Lower Activity Days:** Typically involve light walking.
