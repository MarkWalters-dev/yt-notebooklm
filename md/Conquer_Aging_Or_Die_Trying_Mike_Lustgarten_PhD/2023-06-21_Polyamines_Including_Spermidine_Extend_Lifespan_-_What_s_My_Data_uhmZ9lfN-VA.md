# 2023-06-21 Polyamines Including Spermidine Extend Lifespan - What s My Data

## Executive Summary

*   A high polyamine-rich diet (including spermidine, spermine, and putrescine) significantly extends lifespan in male mice, with 30% more mice surviving compared to a normal polyamine diet.
*   Spermidine levels decline with age in humans and are significantly lower in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to healthy controls.
*   Personal metabolomics data revealed a spermidine concentration of 3.8 micromolar, which is below the median healthy control level of approximately 6 micromolar.
*   While increasing spermidine levels may offer health benefits, it is important to avoid excessively high circulating levels due to an associated increased risk of stroke.

## Mouse Data: Polyamine-Rich Diet and Lifespan

A polyamine-rich diet, including Spermidine, Spermine, and Putrescine, extends lifespan in male mice. Diets were initiated at 24 weeks of age. Female mice were not evaluated in this study.

*   **Normal Polyamine Diet:** Median lifespan was approximately 76 weeks.
*   **Low Polyamine Diet:** The lifespan increase was not significantly different from the normal polyamine diet.
*   **High Polyamine Diet:** 30% more mice were still alive on this diet compared to the normal polyamine diet, demonstrating a significant extension of lifespan.
*   **Spermidine Alone:** Spermidine on its own has also been shown to extend lifespan in mice.

## Human Evidence: Spermidine Levels and Health

Spermidine levels are important for human health, and their levels change with age and disease:

*   **Age-Related Decline:** Circulating levels of spermidine decline during aging. A study of approximately 80 people, ranging from teenagers to 80 years old, showed a clear age-related decline in circulating spermidine.
*   **Cognitive Impairment:** Spermidine levels are lower in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Circulating spermidine levels were significantly lower in individuals diagnosed with AD and MCI when compared with healthy controls.

## Personal Metabolomics Data

In April 2023, personal blood samples were analyzed for metabolomics, including polyamines.

*   **Measured Polyamines:** The data showed concentrations of:
    *   Spermidine: 3.8 micromolar
    *   Spermine: 1.8 micromolar
    *   Putrescine: 0.14 micromolar
*   **Optimal Levels:** To avoid age-related decline and align with healthy cognitive function, it is advisable to aim for higher spermidine levels. The median value for healthy controls was around 6 micromolar.
*   **Caution for High Levels:** It is important not to elevate circulating spermidine levels excessively, as relatively high levels in blood have been associated with an increased risk of stroke.
