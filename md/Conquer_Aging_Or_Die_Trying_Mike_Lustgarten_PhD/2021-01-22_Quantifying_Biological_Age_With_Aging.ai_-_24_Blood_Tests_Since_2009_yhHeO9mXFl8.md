# 2021-01-22 Quantifying Biological Age With Aging.ai - 24 Blood Tests Since 2009

## Executive Summary

*   **Levine's Phenotypic Age Limitations:** While highly correlated with chronological age, Levine's phenotypic age calculator includes chronological age in its calculation, limiting the maximum biological age reduction to approximately 20 years and potentially showing biological age increases even when biomarkers remain stable.
*   **Introduction to Aging.ai:** Aging.ai provides an alternative biological age calculation using 19 standard blood biomarkers from a chemistry panel and complete blood count (CBC). It notably *excludes* chronological age from its model, is strongly correlated with chronological age (R=0.8), and a younger biological age by Aging.ai is associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Impact of Lifestyle Tracking:** The speaker's personal data showed a significant improvement in biological age reduction with Aging.ai, from an average of 7 years younger (2009-2013) to a consistent 15-16 years younger (2016-2020). This improvement coincided with the implementation of consistent dietary tracking and more frequent blood testing.
*   **Areas for Further Improvement:** Despite substantial reductions, the speaker identified specific biomarkers for improvement, aiming to consistently lower glucose levels to 80-85 mg/dL and increase HDL levels to the mid-50s mg/dL.
*   **Projected Longevity:** Based on a personal biological aging rate of 3.3 biological years for every 4.8 chronological years, the speaker projects a biological age of approximately 83 years at a chronological age of 123, with an aspiration to surpass the current human longevity record of 122 years.

## Comparing Biological Age Calculators

Levine's biological age calculator, also known as phenotypic age, is a common tool for quantifying biological age. In a recent blood test from December 29, 2020, with a chronological age of 47, the phenotypic age calculated was 33.8 years, representing a 13-year reduction.

**Limitations of Levine's Phenotypic Age:**

*   **Inclusion of Chronological Age:** Chronological age is a component of the phenotypic age calculation, which contributes to a strong correlation with chronological age. However, this inclusion also creates limitations.
*   **Maximum Reduction:** The maximum biological age reduction possible with this calculator is about 20 years. For a 47-year-old, the lowest possible phenotypic age would be around 27.
*   **Impact of Stable Biomarkers:** If biomarker data remains constant for one year, but chronological age increases by one year, the biological age calculated by phenotypic age will also increase (e.g., from 33.8 to 34.7, an increase of 0.9 years). This raises a question about the accuracy of the biological age increase when underlying biomarkers are unchanged.

## Introducing Aging.ai

Aging.ai is an alternative biological age calculator that does not include chronological age as a variable. It is free to use online and calculates biological age based on 19 input parameters from standard chemistry panels and complete blood count (CBC) tests. These are common tests usually performed during yearly physicals and are relatively inexpensive (around $35 in the US). Notably, C-reactive protein (CRP) is not included in the Aging.ai calculation, making it potentially simpler to use with standard lab results.

### Correlation with Chronological Age

*   **Aging.ai:** Correlates with chronological age at 0.8 (without including chronological age in its calculation).
*   **Levine's Phenotypic Age:** Shows a stronger correlation due to the inclusion of chronological age. In the NHANES III study, it correlated at 0.94, and in NHANES IV, at 0.96.
*   **Horvath's Epigenetic Clock (2013):** The best epigenetic clock, it has a correlation coefficient of 0.97 with chronological age.

While Aging.ai's correlation is not as strong as Levine's or Horvath's, its distinct advantage lies in providing a biological age perspective *without* factoring in chronological age directly.

### Association with All-Cause Mortality

Both Levine's phenotypic age and Aging.ai have demonstrated an association between a younger biological age and a reduced risk of all-cause mortality.

## Personal Biological Age Data (Aging.ai)

The speaker has tracked 24 blood tests since 2009 that can be used to calculate biological age with Aging.ai.

### Early Data (2009-2013)

During this period, blood tests were typically measured once a year at an annual physical. A full set of 19 blood biomarkers was available for 2009, 2012, and 2013.

*   **Average Biological Age (Aging.ai 3.0):** 32 years
*   **Average Chronological Age:** Approximately 39 years
*   **Biological Age Reduction:** Approximately 7 years younger than chronological age.

### Changes in Health Tracking Habits

Starting in 2015, significant changes were made to health tracking:

*   **Dietary Tracking (Starting 2015):**
    *   All food was weighed and data entered into online software.
    *   Macro and micronutrient data were recorded into an Excel file.
    *   Over 2,000 days of dietary data have been accumulated.
*   **Increased Blood Testing Frequency (Starting 2016):**
    *   Blood testing frequency increased from once a year to up to six times a year to gain a more comprehensive understanding of biochemical changes over time.

### Later Data (2016-2020)

Following the implementation of more rigorous tracking, a significant improvement in biological age reduction was observed.

**2016-2017 Data:**

*   **2016 (2 measurements):**
    *   Average Biological Age: 28 years
    *   Average Chronological Age: 44 years
    *   Biological Age Reduction: Approximately 15 years
*   This represents a substantial improvement from the 7-year reduction observed in the 2009-2013 period, attributed to active tracking and intervention based on blood test results.

**2018-2020 Data:**

*   **2018 (6 measurements):**
    *   Average Biological Age: 29 years
    *   Biological Age Reduction: 15.7 years younger than chronological age.
*   **2019 (3 measurements):**
    *   Average Biological Age: 30.3 years
    *   Biological Age Reduction: 16.3 years younger than chronological age.
*   **2020 (6 measurements):**
    *   Average Biological Age: 31.3 years
    *   Biological Age Reduction: 16 years younger than chronological age.

Over this four-year period, the speaker consistently maintained a biological age 15 to 16 years younger than their chronological age.

### Areas for Improvement

Despite consistent reductions, there is still room for further improvement:

*   **Glucose Levels:** Recent measurements show glucose levels consistently over 90 mg/dL, with a target range of 80-85 mg/dL.
*   **HDL Levels:** Average HDL levels are around 44 mg/dL since 2016, with an optimal target in the mid-50s mg/dL.

## Rate of Biological Aging and Longevity Projection

Tracking biological age over multiple years also allows for the calculation of the rate of aging.

**Observed Rate of Aging (2016-2020):**

*   Biological age increased from an average of 28 years (2016) to 31.3 years (2020), a total of 3.3 years of biological aging.
*   This occurred over 4.8 chronological years.
*   **Rate:** 3.3 biological years / 4.8 chronological years.

**Longevity Projection:**

Projecting this rate of aging forward for the next 75 years (from an upcoming chronological age of 48 to 123):

*   Biological aging over 75 chronological years: (3.3 / 4.8) * 75 = 51.56, rounded to 52 years.
*   Projected biological age at a chronological age of 123: Current biological age (31.3 years in 2020) + 52 years of biological aging = approximately 83 years.

This projection suggests a potential for reaching a chronological age of 123 with a biological age of around 83 years, potentially surpassing the current human longevity record of 122 years. Further improvements in biomarkers like glucose and HDL could potentially enhance this rate.
