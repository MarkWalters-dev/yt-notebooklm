# 2021-05-09 Homocysteine Increases During Aging But Can Be Reduced With Diet And Targeted Supplementation

## Executive Summary

*   Supplementation with niacinamide (NAM) leads to a temporary but significant increase in plasma homocysteine levels (e.g., increasing from $11 \mu M$ to $18 \mu M$ three hours post-dosing).
*   Homocysteine levels significantly increase with age, particularly between 40 and 80 years old, and elevated levels are associated with increased relative risk for Alzheimer's-related dementia and all-cause mortality.
*   Homocysteine metabolism is dependent on B vitamins (B6, B12, and folate) and betaine, as deficiencies can lead to accumulation.
*   In personal data analysis, Vitamin B12 supplementation resulted in a $\sim 30\%$ reduction in homocysteine, and an additional high-protein intake was correlated with a further $\sim 20\%$ reduction.
*   Plasma homocysteine levels are not significantly correlated with dietary intake of folate or Vitamin B6 in the observed dataset.

## Homocysteine and Aging/Disease Risk

Homocysteine levels increase naturally during the aging process, observed in cohorts spanning the 40 to 80 year age range.

### Systemic Impacts of Elevated Homocysteine

High homocysteine is associated with adverse impacts across multiple organ systems:

*   **Cardiovascular:** Atherosclerosis, heart attack, and stroke.
*   **Renal:** Kidney dysfunction and reduced function.
*   **Skeletal:** Bone fractures in osteoporotic patients.
*   **Metabolic:** Diabetes.
*   **Reproductive:** Menopause, sexual dysfunction, and pregnancy deficits.
*   **Sensory:** Deficits in sight and hearing.
*   **Nervous System:** Epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia.

### Alzheimer's Risk Correlation

Analysis of relative risk for Alzheimer's-related dementia shows:
*   The lowest risk is observed when blood homocysteine values are around $5 \mu M$.
*   Blood homocysteine levels in the $14$ to $35 \mu M$ range are associated with an increased risk for Alzheimer's-related dementia.

### All-Cause Mortality Correlation

A meta-analysis of six studies involving over 18,000 subjects indicates that as blood levels of homocysteine increase, there is a significantly increased risk for all-cause mortality, suggesting that lower levels are optimal.

## Niacinamide Supplementation Effect

Niacinamide (NAM) is a precursor to NMN, which then synthesizes NAD. However, NAM supplementation can negatively affect homocysteine levels:
*   In subjects supplemented with $300 \text{ mg}$ of niacinamide:
    *   $1.5$ hours post-supplementation, plasma homocysteine increased from a baseline of $11 \mu M$ to $16 \mu M$.
    *   $3$ hours post-supplementation, plasma homocysteine increased further to $18 \mu M$.

## Homocysteine Metabolism Pathways

The conversion and regulation of homocysteine are dependent on several cofactors:

1.  **Vitamin B6 Dependence:**
    *   Homocysteine requires Vitamin B6 as a cofactor to convert into cystathionine.
    *   Vitamin B6 is also required to convert cystathionine into cysteine.
    *   Cysteine can then be incorporated into glutathione (GSH).
    *   *Conclusion: B6 deficiency can lead to homocysteine accumulation and potential glutathione synthesis decreases.*

2.  **Vitamin B12 and Folate Dependence (Remethylation Pathway):**
    *   Vitamin B12 is required as a cofactor for the conversion of homocysteine back into methionine.
    *   Dietary folic acid (converted to blood folate) is also required for this same reaction.

3.  **Betaine Dependence:**
    *   Betaine (trimethylglycine) reacts with homocysteine to form methionine and dimethylglycine.
    *   *Conclusion: Betaine deficiency can also cause homocysteine accumulation.*

## Personal Data Analysis on Intervention Efficacy

The analysis tracked personal homocysteine levels from 2005 to 2021 across 18 measurements.

### Impact of Dietary Tracking

*   **Pre-Dietary Tracking (2005–2009, 6 data points):** Average homocysteine was $7.1 \mu M$.
*   **Post-Dietary Tracking (2015–present, 12 data points):** Average homocysteine increased to $10.3 \mu M$, demonstrating susceptibility to age-related increases despite tracking.

### Recent Optimization Efforts (Last Five Measurements)

*   Recent average homocysteine has been $8.2 \mu M$ (less than $9.1 \mu M$ in five consecutive measurements).
*   The intervention strategy involved supplementing with a daily stack:
    *   Methylfolate: $400 \text{ mcg}$ per day.
    *   Methyl B12: $1000 \text{ mcg}$ per day.
    *   Vitamin B6: Up to $50 \text{ mg}$ per day.

### Correlation with Specific Nutrients

Statistical analysis was performed correlating plasma homocysteine with average daily intake of folate, B6, and B12, along with protein intake.

| Nutrient/Dietary Factor | Correlation with Homocysteine | Statistical Significance (P-value) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Folate Intake | Negative (Higher folate $\rightarrow$ Lower HC) | Not Significant ($p=0.13$) |
| Vitamin B6 Intake | Approximately flat trend | Not Significant ($p=0.87$) |
| Vitamin B12 Supplementation | Significant Decrease ($\sim 30\%$ reduction) | Significant |
| Protein Intake | Strong Negative Correlation ($r = -0.86$) | Strong |

**Note on Betaine:** $4 \text{ g}$ per day of betaine (trimethylglycine) for seven weeks resulted in an average homocysteine level of $11.8 \mu M$, which did not appear to be a beneficial intervention in this case.

### Isolating B12 and Protein Effects

By comparing four data points prior to B12 supplementation with three subsequent points (where protein intake remained similar but B12 was added):
*   Without B12 supplementation (Average Protein: $99 \text{ g}/\text{day}$): Average $\text{HC} = 12.7 \mu M$.
*   With B12 supplementation (Average Protein: $104 \text{ g}/\text{day}$): Average $\text{HC} = 10.5 \mu M$.
    *   This suggests a $\mathbf{20\% \text{ reduction}}$ attributable to B12 alone.

By comparing the B12 supplemented group with the latest data group (where B12 intake remained similar but protein increased):
*   With B12 + High Protein (Average Protein: $128 \text{ g}/\text{day}$): Average $\text{HC} = 8.2 \mu M$.
    *   This resulted in a **further $\mathbf{20\% \text{ reduction}}$**, suggesting that the increased protein intake, in combination with B12, provides an additional benefit beyond B12 supplementation alone.
