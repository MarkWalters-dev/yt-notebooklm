# 2024-03-31 Plasma Metabolites Of A Healthy Lifestyle In Relation To Mortality And Longevity

## Executive Summary
*   Following five healthy lifestyle factors is associated with significant life expectancy gains: an estimated 43 years for women and 38 years for men when projected from age 50, resulting in approximately 12 years greater expected lifespan compared to the general population average.
*   A composite five-factor healthy lifestyle metabolite signature, derived from plasma biomarkers, is significantly associated with a lower risk of all-cause cardiovascular disease and cancer-related mortality.
*   This healthy metabolite signature is also associated with increased odds of living past 85 years (longevity).
*   Metabolite classes associated with a *higher* healthy lifestyle score include higher levels of cholesterol esters and phosphatidylcholine containing plasmalogens.
*   Metabolite classes associated with a *lower* healthy lifestyle score (meaning lower levels are beneficial) include diglycerides and specific short-chain, less unsaturated triglycerides.

## Five Healthy Lifestyle Factors and Life Expectancy

The five factors associated with increased life expectancy are:
1.  **Smoking Status:** Never smoking or not smoking.
2.  **Physical Activity:** $\geq 30$ minutes per day of moderate to vigorous physical activity (average).
3.  **Body Mass Index (BMI):** Normal range (18.5 to $24.9 \text{ kg/m}^2$).
4.  **Alcohol Intake:** Moderate consumption: 5 to 15 grams per day (women); 5 to 30 grams per day (men).
5.  **Diet:** Top 40% score on the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI).

### AHEI Score Components (For Diet Definition)
The AHEI score is calculated based on nine components, with a maximum score of 10 possible for each:
*   Vegetables (Goal: 5 servings/day for max score)
*   Fruit (Goal: 4 servings/day for max score)
*   Nuts and Soy Protein (Goal: 1 serving for max score)
*   Ratio of white meat to red meat (Favoring white meat)
*   Cereal fiber
*   Trans fat (as a percentage of energy intake)
*   P/S ratio (Polyunsaturated fats / Saturated fatty acid intake)
*   Duration of multivitamin use
*   Alcohol in servings per day

## Metabolite Signatures and Mortality/Longevity

A study involving over 11,000 participants (average age 54) with a 28-year follow-up examined the relationship between a composite healthy lifestyle score (based on the five factors) and plasma metabolites.

### Study Methodology
1.  The five healthy lifestyle factors were combined into a **healthy lifestyle score**.
2.  This score was associated with 243 circulating plasma metabolites, grouped into classes (the majority being lipid-derived, but also including amino acids and nucleosides).
3.  A **five-factor healthy lifestyle metabolite signature** was derived based on these associations.
4.  The significance of this signature was evaluated against mortality risk and longevity (defined as living past 85 years).

### Mortality and Longevity Outcomes
*   The healthy lifestyle metabolite signature was associated with a **lower risk of all-cause cardiovascular disease and cancer-related mortality** (Hazard Ratio HR < 1.0).
*   The signature was associated with an **increased odds of living past 85 years**.

## Key Metabolite Associations with Healthy Lifestyle Score

The analysis identified metabolite groups associated both positively and negatively with a higher healthy lifestyle score.

### Metabolite Groups Associated with *Higher* Healthy Lifestyle Score (Higher Levels are Beneficial)
Higher relative levels of these metabolite classes were significantly associated with a higher healthy lifestyle score:
1.  **Cholesterol Esters**
2.  **Phosphatidylcholine containing plasmalogens**

#### Specific Cholesterol Esters
Five specific cholesterol esters showed a significant positive association ($\beta > 0$, $p < 0.05$) with the healthy lifestyle score. These are comprised of cholesterol bound to a fatty acid (e.g., C22:6 cholesterol ester, which contains EPA). Higher levels of these five esters are correlated with better lifestyle alignment and lower mortality risk.

### Metabolite Groups Associated with *Lower* Healthy Lifestyle Score (Lower Levels are Beneficial)
Lower relative levels of these metabolite classes were significantly associated with a higher healthy lifestyle score:
1.  **Diglycerides (Diacylglycerols)**
2.  **Specific Triglycerides:** Those containing relatively shorter chain fatty acids ($< 56$ carbons) and less unsaturation ($< 3$ double bonds).
