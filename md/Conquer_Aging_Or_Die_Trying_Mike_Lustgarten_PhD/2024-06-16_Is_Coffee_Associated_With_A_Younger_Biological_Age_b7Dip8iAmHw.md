# 2024-06-16 Is Coffee Associated With A Younger Biological Age

## Executive Summary

*   A meta-analysis of over 10 million people found that coffee consumption is associated with a significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk across all intake levels, with the lowest risk observed at 2.5 cups per day.
*   A study involving over 13,000 individuals investigated the association between coffee consumption and biological age acceleration (phenoAge acceleration).
*   The lowest odds of phenoAge acceleration (indicating a younger biological age relative to chronological age) were associated with consuming 4 cups of coffee per day.
*   Conversely, consuming less than 3 cups of coffee per day, including no intake, was linked to significantly higher odds (up to 80% higher for non-drinkers) of phenoAge acceleration.
*   While the study adjusted for several potential confounders like diet quality and physical activity, the findings are associational, and limitations such as reverse causation and the need for randomized controlled trials were highlighted.

## Coffee and All-Cause Mortality

A meta-analysis of 21 studies, encompassing over 10 million people, examined the association between coffee consumption and all-cause mortality risk. Compared to non-coffee drinkers, coffee consumers showed a significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk across all intake levels, as evidenced by the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval remaining below a hazard ratio of one. The lowest all-cause mortality risk was associated with 2.5 cups of coffee consumed per day, where the 95% confidence interval was significantly below a hazard ratio of one.

## Coffee and Biological Age (PhenoAge)

A recent study including over 13,000 people investigated the potential association between coffee consumption and biological age, specifically using phenoAge acceleration. PhenoAge is a biological age calculation based on nine blood test biomarkers; phenoAge acceleration signifies having an older biological age relative to one's chronological age.

The study revealed the following associations with coffee consumption (cups per day):

*   **Lowest odds of phenoAge acceleration:** Associated with 4 cups of coffee per day.
*   **No association with phenoAge acceleration:** Consuming more than 5 cups of coffee per day did not show a significant increase in biological age relative to chronological age.
*   **Highest odds of phenoAge acceleration:** Associated with consuming less than 3 cups of coffee per day. Individuals reporting no coffee intake had approximately 80% higher odds of having an older biological age relative to their chronological age.

## Study Methodology and Limitations

This study on coffee and biological age is associational, highlighting a potential role for coffee in slowing biological aging rather than a causative one. To account for healthy user bias, the model was adjusted for standard variables including:

*   Age
*   Gender
*   BMI
*   Total energy intake (calorie intake)
*   Healthy Eating Index 2015 (indicating diet quality)
*   Physical activity

A potential limitation noted in the study's adjustments was their focus on general health rather than more specific, physician-diagnosed conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, liver disease). This specificity could be important when considering reverse causation: do people who drink less coffee already have pre-existing comorbid conditions that influence both their coffee intake and their biological age, rather than the lack of coffee causing phenoAge acceleration? Further randomized controlled trials are needed to more directly investigate causative roles.
