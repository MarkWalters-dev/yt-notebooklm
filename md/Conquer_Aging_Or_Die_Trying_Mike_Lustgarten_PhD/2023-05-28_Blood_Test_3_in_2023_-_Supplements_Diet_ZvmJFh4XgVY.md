# 2023-05-28 Blood Test 3 in 2023 - Supplements Diet

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age, as assessed by PhenoAge and Aging.ai, indicated a reduction of 16 and 17 years respectively, below chronological age.
*   Supplementation with serine and pyridoxal-5-phosphate (Vitamin B6) was introduced for 49 days prior to this blood test.
*   The diet remained largely consistent with previous tests, characterized by high fiber intake and limited processed foods, constituting 1.1% of total calories.
*   Average daily calorie intake was 2174 kcal, tied for the lowest since tracking began in April 2015.
*   Macronutrient breakdown was approximately 18% protein, 34% fat, and 40% net carbohydrates, with 85g of fiber daily.

## Supplements

### New Supplements for Blood Test 3

*   **Serine:**
    *   Supplemented for 49 days prior to blood test 3.
    *   Average daily intake: 1.9 grams.
*   **Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxal-5-phosphate):**
    *   Supplemented for 49 days prior to blood test 3.
    *   Average daily intake (including supplementation): 11.3 milligrams.
    *   This represents a 3.5-fold increase over the previous average intake.

### Rationale for Serine and Vitamin B6 Supplementation

*   **Homocysteine Reduction:** Expected to potentially lower homocysteine levels.
*   **NAD+ Increase:** Vitamin B6 may potentially increase NAD+ levels.

### Impact of New Supplements on Biological Age

*   No dramatic improvement or worsening of biological age as measured by PhenoAge was observed with the addition of serine and Vitamin B6.
*   While the most recent PhenoAge result (16 years younger) was slightly higher than previous tests, it remained within the established lower range.
*   Aging.ai data showed a variation (33 years younger compared to 27-28 years younger), but this was also within the historical range observed since 2016. The supplementation was not strongly correlated with a significant impact on Aging.ai age.

### Future Supplementation Plan (for Blood Test 4 - June 2023)

*   **Serine:** Double intake to approximately 4 grams per day.
*   **Vitamin B6:** Triple intake to approximately 35 milligrams per day.
*   **Goal:** To further investigate potential reductions in homocysteine and increases in NAD+, while monitoring for any adverse effects.

### Existing Supplements

*   **Levothyroxine:** Prescribed due to hypothyroidism diagnosed in twenties.
*   **Vitamin D:** 1000 IU daily during non-summer months.

## Diet

### Dietary Period for Analysis

*   The 49-day period from the day after blood test 2 (03/06/2023) to the day before blood test 3 (04/23/2023).

### Food Composition (Ranked by Intake in Grams)

*   **Total Foods:** 50 different food items.
*   **Consistency:** The food list and amounts have been kept relatively consistent for the past few tests, as this diet composition is associated with youthful biomarker data.
*   **Top Calorie Contributors (for the 49-day period):**
    1.  Sardines
    2.  (Same 10 foods as tests 1 & 2, order may vary)

### Cheat Meals

*   **Frequency:** At most, two cheat meals per cycle (between blood tests).
*   **For this test:**
    *   Immediately after blood test 3: Chocolate bar (130g) with peanut butter and jelly.
    *   On the second occasion: Cheesecake (on daughter's birthday).
*   **"Junk" Food Contribution:** Chocolate, jelly, and cheesecake (excluding peanut butter as a whole food) constituted 1.1% of total calories, indicating a 99% clean diet.

### Macronutrients and Calorie Intake

*   **Average Daily Calorie Intake:** 2174 kcal. This is tied for the lowest average daily intake since diet tracking began in April 2015.
*   **Protein Intake:**
    *   96 grams per day.
    *   Approximately 18% of total calories (96g * 4 kcal/g).
*   **Fat Intake:**
    *   82 grams per day.
    *   Approximately 34% of total calories (82g * 9 kcal/g).
    *   Detailed breakdown available: monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, omega-3, omega-6, saturated, trans fats, and cholesterol.
*   **Carbohydrate Intake:**
    *   **Total Carbohydrates:** 300 grams per day.
    *   **Fiber Intake:** 85 grams per day.
    *   **Net Carbohydrates:** 216 grams per day (300g total carbs - 85g fiber).
    *   Approximately 40% of total calories from net carbs (216g * 4 kcal/g).
*   **Fructose Intake:**
    *   **Total Fructose:** 58 grams per day (includes fructose from fruits, vegetables, and half of sucrose).
    *   This is close to the lowest fructose intake recorded since 2015 (57.5g).
*   **Fiber Calorie Contribution:**
    *   Soluble fiber is fermented by gut bacteria into Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs), providing approximately 2.2 kcal/g.
    *   Total calories from fiber fermentation: 187 kcal (85g * 2.2 kcal/g).
    *   This contribution is factored into the macronutrient calculations.

### Net Macronutrient Breakdown (Adjusted for Fiber Fermentation)

*   **Fat:** Approximately 43%
*   **Net Carbohydrates:** Approximately 40%
*   **Protein:** Approximately 18%

### Micronutrient Intake

*   **Vitamins:**
    *   Full Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) coverage for all listed vitamins.
    *   Many micronutrient intakes are intentionally higher than RDA, based on correlations with blood biomarkers.
    *   **Niacin:** Intake from whole foods is ~2.5 times the RDA.
    *   **Vitamin K:** Intake is 17 times higher than the RDA.
*   **Minerals:** Data not detailed in transcript, but indicated as tracked.
