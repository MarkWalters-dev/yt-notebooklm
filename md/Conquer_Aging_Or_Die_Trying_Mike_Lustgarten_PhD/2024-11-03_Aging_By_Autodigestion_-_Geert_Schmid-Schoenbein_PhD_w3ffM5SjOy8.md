# 2024-11-03 Aging By Autodigestion - Geert Schmid-Schoenbein PhD

## Executive Summary

*   A novel hypothesis suggests that aging is influenced by autodigestion, a process where organisms digest themselves.
*   The relative scarcity of research on digestive enzymes and aging implies an under-explored but potentially crucial area.
*   Experiments show that plasma from shock survivors, unlike non-survivors, does not activate naive leukocytes, suggesting the presence of protective factors in survivor plasma.
*   Pancreatic homogenates, when added to plasma, render all organs potent stimulators of leukocyte activation, indicating the role of pancreatic enzymes.
*   The intestine possesses a potent barrier system, including mucins (specifically mucin 13), that prevents the escape of digestive enzymes into circulation, thus preventing self-digestion.

## Introduction to Autodigestion Hypothesis

*   The core idea is that aging may be linked to the body's internal digestive processes.
*   This contrasts with the more widely studied concept of autophagy.

## Research Context and Motivation

*   A literature search revealed a significant disparity in research:
    *   "Aging" yields 82,000 references.
    *   "Aging AND digestive enzymes" yields only 1 reference.
*   This suggests a scientifically under-explored but potentially significant area of research.

## Hemorrhagic Shock Experiments

*   **Observation:** In a hemorrhagic shock model using young, healthy rats, a subset of animals survived the procedure, while others did not. The reason for this difference was investigated.
*   **Experimental Design:**
    1.  Induce hemorrhagic shock by removing blood via femoral catheter and returning it after one hour.
    2.  Collect plasma from survivors and non-survivors at the end of the experiment.
    3.  Expose naive leukocytes to plasma from survivors and non-survivors.
*   **Findings:**
    *   Plasma from survivors did not activate naive leukocytes.
    *   Plasma from non-survivors caused significant leukocyte activation, similar to encountering bacteria.
    *   This activation has severe consequences for microcirculation and can lead to mortality.
*   **Question:** What factor in the plasma of non-survivors causes this activation?

## Organ Homogenate and Leukocyte Activation

*   **Hypothesis:** If a healthy animal can generate stimulators in plasma, they must originate from organs.
*   **Experimental Design:**
    1.  Homogenize various organs (liver, kidney, spleen, lung, brain, pancreas, intestine).
    2.  Expose naive leukocytes to these homogenates.
*   **Findings:**
    *   Most organ homogenates showed a mild stimulatory effect on leukocytes (around 10% activation).
    *   Pancreatic homogenates consistently showed high and reproducible leukocyte activation.
    *   Intestinal content also stimulated leukocytes unless it was washed.
    *   **Crucial Observation:** Adding trypsin (or other proteases) to any organ homogenate rendered it a potent stimulator of leukocyte activation. This highlighted the role of digestive enzymes.

## Understanding Digestive Enzymes and Self-Protection

*   **Pancreatic Function:** The pancreas is primarily responsible for producing digestive enzymes (95% of its function), with a smaller portion dedicated to insulin (5%).
*   **Enzyme Activity:** Digestive enzymes are released in inactive pro-forms and activated in the duodenum. These enzymes are highly potent and designed to break down proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids.
*   **Intestinal Proteolytic Activity:** Measurements show a very high level of proteolytic activity in the lumen of the intestine (e.g., 2700-3000 fluorescent units) compared to plasma (10-20 fluorescent units).
*   **The Self-Digestion Paradox:** The body must prevent these powerful digestive enzymes from damaging its own tissues.
*   **Nature's Solutions:**
    1.  **Protease Inhibitors:** The liver synthesizes circulating protease inhibitors (e.g., anti-trypsin, anti-chymotrypsin) that neutralize active enzymes. These are present in large amounts, comparable to albumin and fibrinogen.
    2.  **Physical Barriers:** The intestinal epithelium is protected by a barrier system to prevent enzyme leakage.

## The Intestinal Barrier System

*   **Mucin Layer:** The entire intestine is covered by a layer of mucin.
*   **Goblet Cells:** Release mucins that mix with food in the lumen.
*   **Mucin 13:** A specific isoform found on the apical surface of epithelial cells (brush border) acts as a crucial physical barrier.
    *   This barrier allows low molecular weight nutrients (e.g., amino acids) to pass through.
    *   It prevents larger molecules, like digestive enzymes (typically >20 kDa), from crossing.
*   **Intact Barrier Function:** When this barrier is functional, the proteolytic activity measured in the plasma remains very low.

## Potential Implications for Aging

*   The hypothesis suggests that a breakdown or compromise of these protective mechanisms (protease inhibitors or intestinal barriers) could lead to a low-grade, chronic autodigestion.
*   This chronic autodigestion, fueled by released digestive enzymes, could contribute to cellular damage, inflammation, and the physiological decline associated with aging.
*   Further research into the relationship between aging and the integrity of these digestive enzyme control systems is warranted.
