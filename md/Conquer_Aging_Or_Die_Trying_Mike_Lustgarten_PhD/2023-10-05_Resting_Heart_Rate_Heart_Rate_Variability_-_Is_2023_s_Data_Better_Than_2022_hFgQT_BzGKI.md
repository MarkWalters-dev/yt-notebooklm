# 2023-10-05 Resting Heart Rate Heart Rate Variability - Is 2023's Data Better Than 2022

## Executive Summary

*   Resting heart rate (RHR) generally increases with age until approximately 50 years old, after which it tends to decline.
*   Heart rate variability (HRV), measured as RMSSD, declines with age.
*   A low RHR combined with high HRV is indicative of a youthful physiological state, whereas a low RHR with low HRV may suggest aging.
*   The speaker's personal RHR has significantly decreased from 2018 to 2023, and their HRV has significantly increased over the same period.
*   The speaker's 2023 RHR and HRV data indicate a more youthful physiological state compared to predictions based on their chronological age.

## Introduction to Resting Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability

Resting heart rate (RHR) and heart rate variability (HRV) are cardiac-specific measures that also provide insights into the state of the nervous system and adrenal gland. They are influenced by the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, specifically the vagus nerve, as well as sympathetic activation of the adrenal gland which releases norepinephrine and epinephrine.

## Age-Related Changes in Resting Heart Rate

*   **General Trend:** RHR increases with age for both males and females up to approximately 50 years old.
*   **Post-50 Trend:** Data suggests that RHR may begin to decline after 50 years old.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   WHOOP data shows an increase in RHR for males and females up to 50 years old.
    *   Fitbit data, covering ages 20-85, confirms an age-related increase in RHR until about 50 years old, followed by a decline.
*   **Interpretation:** A relatively low RHR can be observed in both young and old individuals, making it ambiguous on its own.

## Age-Related Changes in Heart Rate Variability

*   **Metric Used:** Root Mean Squared of Successive Differences (RMSSD) is the HRV metric calculated by WHOOP.
*   **Trend:** HRV declines with age.
*   **Evidence:** Data plotting RMSSD against age (20-60 years) shows a decline in HRV, irrespective of whether it is measured at 6 AM (solid lines) or 6 PM (dashed lines).
*   **Progression:** HRV continues to decline in individuals older than 60 years.

## Interpreting RHR and HRV in Relation to Age

*   **Youthful State:** Characterized by a relatively low RHR and a relatively high HRV.
*   **Aging State:** Characterized by a low RHR but also a low HRV.
*   **Advanced Age:** May exhibit a low RHR, but is typically accompanied by low HRV.

## Personal Data Analysis: RHR and HRV Trends (2018-2023)

The speaker aims to resist age-related changes and has collected extensive personal data since 2018.

### Resting Heart Rate (RHR)

*   **Starting Point (2018):** Average RHR was 50.9 beats per minute.
*   **2023 Data (First 9 Months):** Average RHR is 43.3 beats per minute.
*   **Year-over-Year Improvement:**
    *   **2023 vs. 2022:** A statistically significant reduction in RHR (p < 0.05).
    *   **2023 vs. 2018:** A statistically significant reduction in RHR (43.3 bpm vs. 50.9 bpm).
*   **Contextualization:** The speaker has avoided the expected age-related increase in RHR up to age 50. The current decline after age 50 needs to be assessed in conjunction with HRV.

### Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

*   **Starting Point (2018):** HRV was 47.3 milliseconds. This was based on an active lifestyle from the start.
*   **Year-over-Year Improvement:** With the exception of 2021, HRV has improved each year.
*   **2023 Data (First 9 Months):** Average HRV is 65.4 milliseconds.
*   **Year-over-Year Improvement:**
    *   **2023 vs. 2022:** A statistically significant year-over-year improvement.
    *   **2023 vs. 2018:** A statistically significant increase, representing a 38% improvement since 2018.
*   **Conclusion:** The idea that HRV is difficult to improve is not supported by the speaker's data.

## Conclusion: A Youthful Physiological State

*   **Speaker's Current State (Age ~51):** A low RHR of 43.3 bpm combined with a high HRV of 65.4 ms in 2023 indicates a "relatively youthful" physiological state.
*   **Comparison to Expected Age-Related Norms:** This is in contrast to the expected state for someone of the speaker's chronological age, which would be a lower HRV (around 35 ms) and a higher RHR (around 57 bpm).
*   **Contributing Factors:** Factors contributing to these improvements in 2023 will be discussed in a subsequent video.
