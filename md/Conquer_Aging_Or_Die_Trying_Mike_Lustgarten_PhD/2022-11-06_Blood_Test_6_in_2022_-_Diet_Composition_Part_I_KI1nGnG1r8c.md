# 2022-11-06 Blood Test 6 in 2022 - Diet Composition Part I

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age (34.5 years via Levine's test, 33 years via aging.ai) was significantly younger than chronological age (15.2 and 16.7 years younger, respectively).
*   Dietary intake for a 63-day period was meticulously tracked using Cronometer and a spreadsheet to calculate correlations with blood biomarkers, guiding dietary adjustments.
*   Strategic dietary changes included increasing strawberry and flaxseed intake, reducing red bell pepper, adjusting barley, and introducing peanuts, based on individual food correlative scores with aging and all-cause mortality risk biomarkers.
*   Improvements were observed in creatinine levels (reduced from 1.04 to 0.98 mg/dL) following increased flaxseed intake, and the T3:T4 ratio (increased from 1.64 to 2.92) coinciding with higher selenium intake from Brazil nuts.
*   Supplementation during this period included daily Levothyroxine (for hypothyroidism) and restarted Vitamin D (last three weeks before the test), with no other geroprotectors or senolytics.

## Blood Test Overview

The sixth blood test in 2022 indicated a biological age of 34.5 years using Levine's test, which is 15.2 years younger than chronological age. The aging.ai prediction was 33 years, 16.7 years younger than chronological age.

## Supplements

*   **Levothyroxine:** Taken daily for hypothyroidism, diagnosed in the twenties.
*   **Vitamin D:** Restarted on October 1st (approximately three weeks before the test) after six weeks without supplementation due to regular sun exposure.
*   No other supplements, including geroprotectors or senolytics, were taken.

## Diet Tracking Methodology

The dietary data corresponds to the 63-day period from August 22 (day of the previous blood test) through October 23 (day before the current blood test on October 24).

The tracking methodology involves:
*   Weighing all food prior to intake daily since April 2015.
*   Entering food amounts into the Cronometer online tracking app.
*   Transferring daily Cronometer data into a spreadsheet.
*   Calculating the average intake for the 63-day period, including individual food amounts, macronutrients, and micronutrients.
*   Using this data to calculate correlations between dietary components and blood biomarkers.
*   Adjusting dietary intake based on these correlations to optimize blood biomarker profiles.

## Individual Food Intake Changes & Rationale

Dietary changes were implemented based on correlative scores with "big picture biomarkers" (e.g., liver enzymes, inflammatory markers, lipids, blood cell counts) that indicate risk for aging and/or all-cause mortality. A "positive correlative score" suggests eating above the average intake, while a "negative correlative score" suggests eating below the average intake.

### Berries

*   **Strawberries:** Intake increased from 289 grams/day to 547 grams/day.
    *   **Reasons for increase:**
        *   **Lower Fructose Content:** Strawberries contain 6.8 grams of fructose per 100 calories, compared to 8.3 grams for an equivalent 100 calories from blackberries and blueberries combined. Lower fructose intake is correlated with fewer blood biomarkers trending negatively.
        *   **Net Correlative Score:** Positive four (+4). Higher strawberry intake is significantly correlated with lower AST, lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), lower LDL, and lower platelets (all favorable outcomes).
    *   **Average Intake:** 356 grams/day since tracking began.
    *   **Compliance:** 547 grams/day is higher than the average, aligning with the positive correlative score. (Check)
*   **Blackberries & Blueberries:** Intake decreased from 144 grams/day each to approximately 32 grams/day each.
    *   **Reasons for decrease:**
        *   **Net Correlative Scores:** Blackberries have a negative two (-2) score, and blueberries have a negative three (-3) score.
    *   **Average Intake:** Greater than 111 grams/day each.
    *   **Compliance:** 32 grams/day is less than the average, aligning with the negative correlative scores. (Check)

### Red Bell Pepper

*   **Intake Change:** Reduced from 233 grams/day to 227 grams/day.
    *   **Net Correlative Score:** Negative four (-4). While correlated with higher albumin (favorable), it is also significantly correlated with higher AST, creatinine, neutrophils, and platelets (unfavorable), and a lower percentage of lymphocytes (unfavorable).
    *   **Average Intake:** 293 grams/day since tracking food intake (started 2018).
    *   **Compliance:** 227 grams/day is less than the average, aligning with the negative correlative score. (Check)
    *   **Rationale for not eliminating:** Red bell peppers are a concentrated source of beta-cryptoxanthin. Higher blood levels of beta-cryptoxanthin are significantly correlated with a younger GrimAge epigenetic clock (a strong predictor of all-cause mortality risk).

### Barley

*   **Intake Change:** Reduced from approximately 59 grams/day (for test #5) to 40 grams/day (for test #6).
    *   **Net Correlative Score:** Positive three (+3). It is significantly correlated with higher homocysteine and triglycerides (unfavorable) but inversely correlated with five other biomarkers (favorable).
    *   **Average Intake:** 14 grams/day since tracking food intake (started 2018).
    *   **Compliance:** 40 grams/day is higher than the average, aligning with the positive correlative score. (Check)
    *   **Experiment Goal:** To determine the optimal upper limit of barley intake (above 14 g/day) that simultaneously optimizes all seven associated biomarkers. Reducing barley from 59g to 40g/day was associated with slight reductions in homocysteine and triglycerides, while other biomarkers remained stable. This suggests 40 grams/day might be a more optimal intake than 59 grams/day within the context of the overall diet.

### Flaxseed

*   **Intake Change:** Increased from approximately 12 grams/day to 16 grams/day.
    *   **Net Correlative Score:** Positive four (+4). Significantly correlated with lower neutrophils, creatinine, LDL, and red blood cells (favorable), but also lower HDL (unfavorable).
    *   **Average Intake:** 9.7 grams/day since 2018.
    *   **Compliance:** 16 grams/day is higher than the average, aligning with the positive correlative score. (Check)
    *   **Specific Goal:** To further reduce creatinine levels. Creatinine decreased from 1.04 to 0.98 mg/dL between tests. Further increases in flaxseed intake are planned to explore its impact on achieving a target creatinine level of around 0.9 mg/dL.

### Peanuts

*   **Intake Change:** Increased from 0 grams/day to 12 grams/day.
    *   **Main Reason:** To maintain high niacin intake (above 40 mg/day) after reducing barley, which is also a niacin source.
    *   **Net Correlative Score:** Zero (0). Significantly correlated with an equal number of biomarkers trending favorably and unfavorably.
    *   **Average Intake:** 2.6 grams/day since 2018.
    *   **Compliance:** 12.3 grams/day is higher than the average, which does not align with a net zero correlative score suggesting average intake. (X)

### Pistachios

*   **Intake Change:** Reduced from 11 grams/day to 9.9 grams/day.
    *   **Main Reason:** Pistachios are a source of melatonin. Intake was temporarily limited on certain days to mitigate potential morning sleepiness.
    *   **Net Correlative Score:** Positive four (+4).
    *   **Average Intake:** 2.1 grams/day.
    *   **Compliance:** 9.9 grams/day is higher than the average, aligning with the positive correlative score. (Check)

### Eggs

*   **Intake Change:** Increased from 0 grams/day to 7 grams/day.
    *   **Main Reason:** Part of a dietary cholesterol DHEA sulfate experiment.

### Brazil Nuts

*   **Intake Change:** Increased from 3.4 grams/day to 4.7 grams/day.
    *   **Main Reason:** Brazil nuts are a rich source of selenium, which is required for the conversion of thyroid hormone T4 into its active form, T3.
    *   **Preliminary Data (T3:T4 Ratio Experiment):**
        *   **October 3 (finger prick):** T3:T4 ratio was 1.64. Average selenium intake for 7 days prior was 186 micrograms/day.
        *   **October 18 (venipuncture):** T3:T4 ratio was 2.92 (higher). Average selenium intake for 7 days prior was 272 micrograms/day (significantly higher).
        *   While not statistically significant with only two data points, the T3:T4 ratio (a higher ratio is associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk) improved as selenium intake increased, potentially indicating a beneficial effect, though other factors (e.g., venipuncture vs. finger prick method) could contribute.
    *   **Net Correlative Score:** Negative two (-2). Correlated with four biomarkers trending unfavorably and two trending favorably.
    *   **Average Intake:** 5 grams/day since tracking food intake.
    *   **Compliance:** 4.7 grams/day is less than the average, aligning with the negative correlative score. (Check)

### Ginger (Fresh)

*   **Intake Change:** Increased from 0.6 grams/day to 1.9 grams/day.
    *   **Net Correlative Score:** Positive seven (+7). Significantly correlated with seven biomarkers trending favorably for aging and/or all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Average Intake:** 0.65 grams/day since tracking food intake.
    *   **Compliance:** 1.9 grams/day is higher than the average, aligning with the positive correlative score. (Check)

### Cloves

*   **Intake Change:** Increased from 0 grams/day to 0.1 grams/day (nominally significant difference in intake).
    *   **Main Reason:** To potentially optimize the oral microbiome. Hypothesis: dietary ground cloves, similar to dietary nitrates, could lead to beneficial metabolites being absorbed, secreted into saliva by salivary glands, and then impacting the oral microbiome. This will be retested with salivary microbiome analysis.
    *   **Net Correlative Score:** Positive one (+1).
    *   **Average Intake:** 0.13 grams/day since 2018.
    *   **Compliance:** 0.1 grams/day is less than the average, which does not align with a positive correlative score suggesting higher intake. (X)
    *   **Note:** Clove intake has been increased more regularly since this blood test to align with the positive correlation for test #7.

## Occasional "Junk" Food Intake

"Junk" food consumption is generally limited to the day of and the day after a blood test. For this 63-day period, junk food was consumed on three days:
*   **Pizza:** Two slices (Domino's).
*   **Nutella:** 145 grams, consumed on two days.
*   **Swedish Fish (candy):** 60 grams, consumed on one day.

This document covers the first part of the diet analysis for blood test #6, focusing on individual food composition. Part two will address the macronutrient and micronutrient profiles.
