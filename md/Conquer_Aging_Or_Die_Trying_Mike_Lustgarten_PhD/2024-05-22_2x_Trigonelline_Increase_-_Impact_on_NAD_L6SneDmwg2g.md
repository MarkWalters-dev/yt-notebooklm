# 2024-05-22 2x Trigonelline Increase - Impact on NAD

## Executive Summary
*   Mice studies suggest Trigonelline intake increases NAD levels.
*   An initial test with $121\text{ g/day}$ of clover sprouts resulted in a potential NAD increase to $29.6 \text{ micromolar}$, which was above the established baseline range ($18.5$ to $26.6 \text{ micromolar}$).
*   Doubling the clover sprout intake (to $257.1\text{ g/day}$) resulted in a significant *decrease* in NAD levels to $19 \text{ micromolar}$.
*   After completely eliminating supplemental nicotinic acid intake prior to testing, NAD levels dropped to the second lowest recorded measurement across 18 tests, suggesting prior nicotinic acid intake may have influenced the initial positive result.

## Background: Trigonelline and NAD
Trigonelline is also known as 1-methylnicotinic acid. Previous data in Little (dwarf) mice indicates that Trigonelline increases NAD levels. This study series investigates whether increasing dietary intake of Trigonelline-rich foods can elevate NAD levels in humans.

Crimson clover seeds contain among the highest levels of Trigonelline compared to other tested foods, including alfalfa and coffee.

## Experimental Methodology

The experiments aimed to test the effect of increased clover sprout (Trigonelline source) intake on intracellular NAD levels, measured via blood analysis sent to Ginfinity.

### April 1 Test (Initial Observation)
1.  **Intervention:** Clover sprouts were added to the diet at an average intake of $121\text{ grams per day}$.
2.  **Duration:** Nine days prior to NAD measurement.
3.  **Result:** NAD measured at $29.6 \text{ micromolar}$.
4.  **Context:** This was considered a potential NAD increase, as the subject's baseline NAD range without NAD precursors (nicotinic acid or NMN) had previously been no higher than $26.6 \text{ micromolar}$. *Note: Average nicotinic acid intake was $20\text{ mg/day}$ during the one week prior to this test.*

### April 29 Test (Dose Doubling)
1.  **Intervention:** Clover sprout intake was more than doubled to an average of $257.1\text{ grams per day}$.
2.  **Duration:** Eleven days prior to NAD testing.
3.  **Nicotinic Acid Control:** To account for potential confounding effects, nicotinic acid intake was completely eliminated nine days prior to NAD level measurement.
4.  **Result:** NAD measured at $19 \text{ micromolar}$.

## Data Analysis and Implications

The results present a contradiction: a near-doubling of the Trigonelline source led to a significant drop in NAD concentration, suggesting that a higher dose was detrimental or that the initial measurement was misleading.

### Conflicting Results Analysis:
1.  **Low Dose Hypothesis:** It is possible that a lower, specific intake of Trigonelline is optimal for maintaining NAD levels at the higher end of the baseline range, and exceeding this optimal level leads to a decrease.
2.  **Random Variation Hypothesis:** The $29.6 \text{ micromolar}$ reading might be random variation. However, the subject's established baseline range without precursors is $18.5$ to $26.6 \text{ micromolar}$. If $29.6 \text{ micromolar}$ represents the ceiling of the non-precursor range, then the $19 \text{ micromolar}$ result (the second lowest over 18 tests) is statistically significant in the negative direction.
3.  **Nicotinic Acid Confounding:** The initial positive result ($29.6 \text{ micromolar}$) might have been influenced by residual effects of nicotinic acid taken shortly before that test, despite the wash-out period. The subsequent test, conducted after completely removing nicotinic acid intake, yielded a near-historic low NAD level.

### Conclusion on Clover Sprouts
The current data suggests that using high amounts of clover sprouts as a source of Trigonelline does not reliably increase NAD levels and may correlate with lower outcomes when confounding precursors (like nicotinic acid) are removed.

## Future Considerations
The investigation into Trigonelline-rich foods for NAD elevation is paused, pending further analysis of the remaining option: coffee.

*   **Coffee Experiment Constraint:** To test coffee while maintaining caffeine neutrality (due to being a slow caffeine metabolizer), green tea consumption must be halted prior to the test.
