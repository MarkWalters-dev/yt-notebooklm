# 2021-07-12 Which Diet Is Optimal For Health - The Evolutionary Perspective Part III Featuring Dr. Michael Rose

### Executive Summary

*   Fruit flies raised on an evolutionarily *recent* diet (banana) exhibited better age-dependent fitness at younger ages but a worse health span at older ages compared to those on an *ancestral* diet (apple).
*   Human adaptation to agricultural foods (e.g., grains, dairy) is highly dependent on ancestral history, with some populations (e.g., Middle Eastern/South Asian) being more adapted than others (e.g., Northwestern Eurasian, Australasian).
*   By approximately age 60, humans generally lose their adaptation to agricultural foods, regardless of ancestry, suggesting a broad benefit from reducing their consumption in later life.
*   Novel industrial food products introduced since 1850 (e.g., processed seed oils, trans fats, nitrites, certain industrial preservatives) are universally toxic, and humans have no evolutionary adaptation to them.
*   General evolutionary principles, supported by mathematical models and experiments, indicate that a species' long-abandoned ancestral diet can offer superior health span benefits at older ages, even if more recently adapted diets appear beneficial in youth.

## Fruit Fly Data: Recent vs. Ancestral Diets

The study investigated the impact of evolutionarily recent versus ancestral diets on the health span of fruit flies (*Drosophila*).

### Health Span Metric

*   **Age-Dependent Fitness (p<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>):** Defined as the product of survival probability and fecundity (ability to produce offspring). This metric comprehensively captures both longevity and reproductive capacity, ensuring a true measure of health span rather than just lifespan.

### Study Diets

*   **Evolutionarily Recent Diet (Banana-based with molasses):** Fruit flies were raised on this diet for approximately 1,000 generations over 30 years. This period is considered a relatively recent evolutionary adaptation for the flies.
*   **Ancestral Diet (Apple-based):** The exact number of generations is unknown, but *Drosophila* have consumed apples for at least hundreds of years, making this representative of their ancestral diet.

### Findings

*   **Younger Ages (up to 15 days old):** Fruit flies on the evolutionarily recent banana-based diet displayed better age-dependent fitness compared to those on the ancestral apple diet.
*   **Older Ages:** In contrast, flies on the evolutionarily recent banana-based diet exhibited a worse health span at older ages when compared to those on the ancestral apple diet.

This suggests that an evolutionarily recent diet may confer benefits in youth, but an ancestral diet provides superior health span in later life.

## Human Ancestry and Diet Adaptation

Research, including Grant Rutledge's doctoral thesis (2020), highlights the significant relationship between evolutionary history, both recent and long-term, and dietary adaptation in humans.

### Spectrum of Adaptation to Agricultural Foods

Human populations show varying degrees of adaptation to agricultural foods (e.g., grains, milk) based on their ancestral history:

*   **Well-Adapted:** Populations from regions like the Middle East or South Asia, with a long history of agriculture, may be well-adapted to grain-based and milk-based diets potentially into their 50s.
*   **Moderately Adapted:** Individuals with ancestry from the Northwestern Periphery of Eurasia may be less adapted to agricultural foods. For these individuals, reduced consumption of such foods becomes increasingly important as they age, especially from middle age onwards.
*   **Unadapted:** Populations with entirely indigenous Australasian ancestry, who did not consume agricultural foods until relatively recently (e.g., within the last 200 years), are wholly unadapted. For these individuals, foods like bread and milk can be considered toxic.

### Age-Related Loss of Adaptation

A critical finding is that, regardless of individual ancestry, by the time most humans reach their 60s, they are generally no longer adapted to agricultural foods. This suggests that the forces of natural selection interact with age and recent evolutionary changes, making a return to more ancestral dietary patterns beneficial in later life.

## General Dietary Principles for Optimal Health Span

The principles derived from the fruit fly experiments and human ancestral data are broadly applicable:

*   **Long-Abandoned Diets Can Be Beneficial:** If a species has recently changed its core dietary practices (within 10,000 generations), long-abandoned ancestral diets can be more beneficial at later ages, even if the recently adapted diet shows advantages in youth.
*   **Mathematical Foundation:** This principle is supported by general mathematical models, demonstrating its robustness across species, not just fruit flies or humans.
*   **Eliminate Toxic Foods:** For individuals around age 50 and beyond, it is often beneficial to eliminate:
    *   Grains (e.g., wheat, rice, corn)
    *   Foods derived from milk (from any animal)
    *   Legumes

### Universally Harmful Modern Industrial Foods

Beyond individual ancestral adaptations, several industrial food products introduced since approximately 1850 are novel to the human diet and are universally considered toxic:

*   Processed seed oils
*   Trans fats
*   Nitrites (used as a preservative)
*   Other brand-new industrial food products

Humans have no evolutionary adaptation to these substances, which fall within the spectrum of toxins to poisons.

## Importance of Objective Health Markers

While general evolutionary principles guide dietary recommendations, it is crucial to consider individual variations and objective markers of health. For the vast majority of people, adhering to evolutionarily informed dietary guidelines will lead to improved health outcomes, especially with age. However, for a small minority, if objective biomarkers confirm that a particular dietary choice, even if non-ancestral, is net neutral or beneficial, it may be acceptable. This regional and individual variability underscores the importance of personalized health monitoring.
