# 2020-07-07 Dietary Vitamin C Intake - How Much Is Optimal

## Executive Summary

*   Higher vitamin C intake than the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk, with risk decreasing up to approximately 450 mg/day.
*   Circulating vitamin C levels show an almost linear decrease in all-cause mortality risk as concentrations increase.
*   Approximately 1000 mg of daily vitamin C intake appears to saturate circulating vitamin C levels in the blood, reaching around 80 micromolar.
*   Optimal absorption of dietary vitamin C into intestinal cells requires co-transport with two sodium ions.

## Introduction to Vitamin C Intake

The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for vitamin C for adults aged 19 and older is 90 mg/day for men and 75 mg/day for women. Higher intakes are recommended for smokers and breastfeeding women, reaching a maximum of 120 mg/day.

## Association Between Dietary Vitamin C Intake and All-Cause Mortality

A meta-analysis of 14 studies investigated the association between dietary vitamin C intake and all-cause mortality risk, including deaths from cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory diseases, and infection.

*   The data shows a significantly reduced risk for vitamin C intakes up to approximately 450 mg/day.
*   The lowest all-cause mortality risk appeared to be at vitamin C intakes of 200 mg/day, though a direct comparison with 400 or 450 mg/day was not definitively made in the study.

## Circulating Vitamin C Levels and Mortality Risk

Further analysis examined the relationship between circulating vitamin C levels and all-cause mortality risk.

*   Higher circulating vitamin C levels are associated with an almost linear decrease in the risk of death from all causes.

## Achieving Optimal Circulating Vitamin C Levels

To achieve optimal circulating vitamin C concentrations, defined as approximately 80 micromolar (µmol/L), dietary intake needs to be considered.

*   The current RDA for vitamin C (90 mg/day for men, 75 mg/day for women) results in circulating levels of only about 25 µmol/L.
*   An estimated daily intake of 1000 mg of vitamin C is required to reach circulating levels of approximately 80 µmol/L.
*   Intakes higher than 1000 mg, up to 2500 mg per day, show only a marginal increase in circulating vitamin C concentration (e.g., from 78 µmol/L to 82 µmol/L).

## Vitamin C Rich Foods

Prioritizing whole foods for vitamin C intake is recommended, with nutrient density (vitamin C per calorie) as a key factor.

*   **Peppers**, particularly yellow bell peppers, are the most vitamin C-dense food, providing 679 mg per 100 calories.
*   Other significant sources include red bell peppers, broccoli, and spinach.

## Factors Affecting Vitamin C Absorption

Vitamin C transport into intestinal cells is facilitated by a transporter that requires two sodium ions for each molecule of ascorbate.

*   A high vitamin C diet consumed with a low sodium diet may limit vitamin C absorption.
*   To optimize vitamin C absorption, an intake of approximately 1800 mg of sodium per day is suggested in conjunction with a high vitamin C intake.
