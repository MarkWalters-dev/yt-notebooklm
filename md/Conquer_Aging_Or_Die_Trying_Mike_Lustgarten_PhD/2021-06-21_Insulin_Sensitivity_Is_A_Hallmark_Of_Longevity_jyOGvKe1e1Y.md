# 2021-06-21 Insulin Sensitivity Is A Hallmark Of Longevity

## Executive Summary

*   Insulin sensitivity, characterized by low insulin and optimal glucose levels, is consistently associated with increased longevity across different species.
*   Calorie-restricted mice and Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone (GHRH) knockout mice exhibit increased lifespan, significantly lower fasting insulin, and improved insulin sensitivity (lower HOMA values).
*   GHRH knockout mice combined with calorie restriction show the longest lifespans, alongside the lowest glucose, insulin, and HOMA values among all groups studied.
*   Centenarians demonstrate superior insulin sensitivity compared to younger age groups, with HOMA values declining in those over 90 to levels lower than people in their 20s-40s.
*   The prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes is significantly lower and its onset is substantially delayed in centenarians, often resembling prevalence rates of individuals 50-60 years younger.

## Insulin Sensitivity & Resistance Defined

### Insulin Sensitivity (Fasting State)

In an insulin-sensitive individual in the fasting state:
Liver -> Produces new glucose molecules (gluconeogenesis) -> Glucose taken up by target tissues (brain, adipose cells, muscle).
*Insulin secretion is low.*

### Insulin Sensitivity (Fed State)

After eating, in an insulin-sensitive individual:
Meal -> Rise in blood glucose -> Triggers pancreas -> Releases insulin -> Insulin triggers target tissues (brain, adipose cells, muscle) -> Take up glucose -> Blood glucose levels fall -> Removes stimulus for insulin secretion -> Insulin levels decrease.
*Insulin suppresses gluconeogenesis, making it a minor contributor to the blood glucose pool.*

### Insulin Resistance State

In a condition of insulin resistance:
Target tissues -> Resist effects of insulin -> Increased circulating glucose.
Liver -> Resistant to insulin effects -> Continues to produce new glucose molecules (increased gluconeogenesis).
Pancreas -> Tries to compensate for rising blood glucose -> Releases even more insulin (compensatory hyperinsulinemia).
This can result in:
*   Normal insulin levels with high glucose.
*   High insulin levels with normal glucose.
*   Both high insulin levels and high glucose levels.

Data considering both insulin and glucose levels provides more comprehensive insight into insulin sensitivity status than either metabolite alone.

### Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA)

HOMA is a method to assess insulin sensitivity status using combined glucose and insulin data.
**HOMA = [Glucose (mmol/L) * Insulin (mIU/L)] / 22.5**
A lower HOMA value indicates greater insulin sensitivity, while a higher value reflects less insulin sensitivity.

## Mouse Data: Lifespan and Insulin Sensitivity

### Calorie Restricted (CR) Mice

Mice on a 30% calorie restriction diet demonstrated an increased average lifespan compared to normal mice allowed to eat ad libitum (as much as they wanted).
*   **Glucose levels:** No significant difference compared to ad libitum fed mice.
*   **Fasting Insulin:** A 60% reduction in CR mice compared to ad libitum fed mice.
*   **HOMA:** A 60% reduction in CR mice (e.g., 0.15 vs. 0.37 in ad libitum fed mice), primarily driven by the reduction in insulin levels.

### Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone (GHRH) Knockout Mice

Mice with the growth hormone releasing hormone gene knocked out (GHRH knockout mice) exhibited a significant increase in average lifespan compared to wild-type animals fed ad libitum.
*   **Glucose levels:** Approximately 20% lower than ad libitum fed wild-type mice, making them the lowest among non-CR groups.
*   **Fasting Insulin:** More than 50% reduction compared to ad libitum fed wild-type mice, with levels similar to those found in CR mice.
*   **HOMA:** More than 60% reduced compared to ad libitum fed wild-type mice, with values very similar to CR mice, even without calorie restriction.

### GHRH Knockout Mice on Calorie Restriction

GHRH knockout mice that were also calorie restricted displayed the longest average and maximum lifespan among all groups studied, with some reaching 50 months of age.
*   **Glucose levels:** Similar to GHRH knockout mice fed ad libitum, but lower than CR mice or ad libitum fed wild-type mice.
*   **Fasting Insulin:** The lowest of all groups (e.g., 0.5 compared to 0.7 in GHRH knockout ad libitum, 0.6 in CR, and 1.5 in ad libitum wild-type mice).
*   **HOMA:** The lowest of all groups (0.10), indicating the highest insulin sensitivity.

**Summary:** GHRH knockout mice on calorie restriction showed the lowest glucose, lowest insulin, and lowest HOMA values, in conjunction with the longest average and maximum lifespan in this study. Other animal models of extended lifespan, such as FGF21 transgenic mice, also exhibit relatively low insulin and glucose levels.

## Human Evidence: Centenarians and Insulin Sensitivity

### HOMA Values in Centenarians

Analysis of HOMA values across different age groups reveals a trend:
*   HOMA values typically increase from age 20-40 up to 80-90 years old.
*   Interestingly, for individuals living past 90 and over 100 years old, HOMA values decline significantly, becoming the lowest of all age groups, even compared to the youngest cohort. This indicates centenarians possess superior insulin sensitivity.

### Prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes in Centenarians

Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is defined by a blood glucose level greater than 126 mg/dL (or 7 mmol/L) or a prior diabetes diagnosis.

*   **Chinese Centenarian Cohort (average age 103):** The prevalence of T2D was between 9.1% and 12.9% across age ranges of 100-110+ years. This means 87% to 91% of these centenarians did not have T2D. The average fasted blood glucose in this group was 92 mg/dL, which is within an optimal range.
*   **Comparison to General Chinese Population (non-centenarians):**
    *   Age < 40 (average 29): 5.9% T2D prevalence.
    *   Age 40-59 (average 49): 12.9% T2D prevalence.
    *   Age > 60 (average 70): 20.2% T2D prevalence.
    *   The T2D prevalence in centenarians (9.1-12.9%) is comparable to that of people 50-60 years younger (e.g., the 40-59 age group at 12.9%).

### New England Centenarian Study (NECS)

Further data from the New England Centenarian Study supports these findings:
*   **90-100 year olds (n=1807, average age 100):** Only 7% had been diagnosed with T2D.
*   **Controls (average age 72):** 17% had been diagnosed with T2D, more than double the rate of the centenarian group.

This study also looked at the age when 10% of each cohort had been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes:
*   **Controls:** 10% had T2D by an average age of 73 years old.
*   **Centenarians:** 10% had T2D by an average age of 99 years old.
This indicates that the onset of Type 2 Diabetes was delayed by up to 26 years in centenarians.

Maintaining optimal glucose levels (80-94 mg/dL) and relatively low insulin levels appears to be a critical strategy for promoting longevity.
