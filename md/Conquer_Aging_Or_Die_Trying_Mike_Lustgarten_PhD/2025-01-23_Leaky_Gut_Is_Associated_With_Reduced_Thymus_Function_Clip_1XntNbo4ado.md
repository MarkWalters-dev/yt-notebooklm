# 2025-01-23 Leaky Gut Is Associated With Reduced Thymus Function Clip

## Executive Summary
*   With age, the thymus shrinks and undergoes architectural changes, leading to a decline in the number of new T cells leaving the organ.
*   Older adults have fewer naive T cells, which are crucial for fighting new infections. Their ability to respond to novel pathogens decreases.
*   Though memory T cells accumulate with age, their function is impaired, specifically their ability to expand and proliferate when re-exposed to a pathogen.
*   A significant decline in recent thymic immigrants (T cells that have just completed development and entered circulation) is observed primarily in older adults with high microbial translocation.

## Age-Related Decline in Thymus Function
With age, the thymus, the organ where T cells develop, shrinks and undergoes architectural changes. This results in a decline in the number of T cells leaving the aged thymus.

Clinically, this means older adults have fewer naive (new) T cells. These cells are vital for combating infections never encountered before, and their reduced numbers impair this ability. This may explain the disproportionate response observed in older adults during the pandemic when exposed to a new pathogen.

While older adults accumulate memory T cells (which have previously encountered pathogens), these cells also exhibit functional changes. Despite having more memory T cells, they are not as functional, with a key defect being their impaired ability to expand and proliferate upon re-exposure to a pathogen.

## Impact of Microbial Translocation on Thymus Output
In a study, older cohorts were divided into groups with low and high microbial translocation. As direct examination of the human thymus is not possible, researchers rely on surrogate markers: recent thymic immigrants (RTIs). These are T cells that have just completed their development and entered circulation, and their levels are known to decline with age.

The study found that a significant decline in these recent thymic immigrants was observed *only* in older adults with higher microbial translocation. This suggests a link between leaky gut and reduced thymus function.
