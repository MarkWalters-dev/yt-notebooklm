# 2022-11-20 Kidney Function - What s Optimal For Health And Potentially Longevity

### Executive Summary

*   Creatinine levels typically increase with age, and eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate, a measure of kidney function) generally declines, though creatinine often remains within standard reference ranges until approximately age 80.
*   For individuals under 65 years old, an eGFR greater than 95 mL/min/1.73m² is associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk.
*   For individuals over 65 years old, the lowest all-cause mortality risk is associated with an eGFR between 65-115 mL/min/1.73m² for men and 75-118 mL/min/1.73m² for women. An eGFR consistently below 65 mL/min/1.73m² is linked to increased all-cause mortality risk in this age group.
*   Personal longitudinal data demonstrated a significant decrease in creatinine levels over a 17-year period, counteracting the typical age-related increase, largely attributed to consistent daily diet tracking initiated in 2015.
*   Dietary analysis suggests a significant inverse correlation between omega-3 intake (specifically from flaxseeds) and creatinine levels. Increased flaxseed consumption is being explored as a strategy to further optimize eGFR, with consideration for overall biomarker health.

## Creatinine and GFR Basics

Creatinine is a biomarker used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is a key measure of kidney function. More specifically, GFR helps estimate stages of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD):
*   **No CKD or Stage 1:** eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m²
*   **Stage 5 CKD (approaching kidney failure):** eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73m²

## Age-Related Changes in Creatinine and eGFR

Studies show a significant positive correlation between serum creatinine levels and age, indicating that creatinine generally increases during aging. In a study of approximately 6,000 people aged 20-90 years, creatinine levels were observed to rise with age.

The Quest Labs reference range for creatinine is 0.6 to 1.29 mg/dL. While creatinine levels increase with age, they typically remain within this reference range for most of the lifespan (ages 25-80), only consistently exceeding it around age 80.

As creatinine increases with age, the creatinine-derived eGFR declines. Young adults often have eGFR values around 125 mL/min/1.73m², which indicates better kidney function (lower creatinine). In older adults, higher creatinine is indicative of a lower eGFR and worse kidney function.

## eGFR and All-Cause Mortality Risk

A meta-analysis of 46 studies, including over 2 million people, investigated the relationship between eGFR and all-cause mortality risk. The hazard ratio (HR) was adjusted, and a HR of 1 served as the referent.

### In People Younger Than 65 Years Old

*   **Referent:** eGFR of 95 mL/min/1.73m².
*   **Lowest Mortality Risk:** eGFR greater than 95 mL/min/1.73m² was associated with a significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk for both men and women compared to the referent.
*   **Increased Mortality Risk:**
    *   **Men:** Significantly increased all-cause mortality risk when eGFR was 85-95 mL/min/1.73m² or less than 70 mL/min/1.73m².
    *   **Women:** Significantly increased all-cause mortality risk when eGFR was less than 95 mL/min/1.73m².

### In People Older Than 65 Years Old

*   **Referent:** eGFR of 95 mL/min/1.73m².
*   **Lowest Mortality Risk (not significantly different from referent):**
    *   **Men:** eGFR in the 65 to 115 mL/min/1.73m² range.
    *   **Women:** eGFR in the 75 to 118 mL/min/1.73m² range.
*   **Increased Mortality Risk:**
    *   **Men:** Significantly increased all-cause mortality risk when eGFR was greater than 115 mL/min/1.73m² or less than 65 mL/min/1.73m².
    *   **Women:** Significantly increased all-cause mortality risk when eGFR was greater than 118 mL/min/1.73m² or less than 75 mL/min/1.73m².
*   **Consistent finding:** For people older than 65, an eGFR less than 65 mL/min/1.73m² consistently correlated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.

## Personal Longitudinal Data & Goals

Based on the evidence, the personal longitudinal goals for kidney function are:
1.  Avoid the age-related increase for creatinine and the corresponding decrease for eGFR.
2.  Consistently keep eGFR greater than 95 mL/min/1.73m².

### Creatinine Levels (2006-2022)

Over a 17-year span (2006-2022), with 48 blood tests, a significant inverse correlation between creatinine levels and age was observed. Creatinine levels declined over time, counteracting the expected age-related increase.

#### Impact of Diet Tracking
*   **Pre-Diet Tracking (First 8 measurements):**
    *   Average creatinine: 1.12 mg/dL
    *   Average eGFR: 86 mL/min/1.73m²
*   **Post-Diet Tracking (Since 2015, 40 tests):**
    *   Average creatinine: 0.95 mg/dL
    *   Average eGFR: 96 mL/min/1.73m²
    *   Both values are significantly better than pre-diet tracking.

#### Creatinine Trends Since Diet Tracking (2015-Present)

Since initiating daily diet tracking in 2015, no statistically significant age-related change for creatinine has been observed. This indicates success in avoiding the age-related increase for creatinine.

### eGFR Levels Since Diet Tracking (2015-Present)

Over the same eight-year period and 40 blood tests since 2015, eGFR was greater than 95 mL/min/1.73m² for 24 out of 40 tests (60% of tests). While this majority indicates achieving the goal of having an eGFR associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk, there is still room for improvement to more consistently maintain eGFR above 95 mL/min/1.73m².

## Dietary Factors Influencing Creatinine

Analysis of dietary components (macros and micronutrients) over 40 blood tests since 2015 revealed significant correlations with creatinine levels.
*   **Omega-3:** A relatively higher omega-3 intake is significantly correlated with lower creatinine levels.

### Specific Food Sources of Omega-3

Tracking individual food amounts since 2018 (over 25 tests) identified primary omega-3 sources as flaxseeds, walnuts, and sardines.
*   **Flaxseeds:** Significantly correlated with lower creatinine levels (p < 0.05). Higher flaxseed intake corresponded to lower creatinine.
*   **Walnuts and Sardines:** Not significantly correlated with creatinine levels in this data.

### Future Optimization Strategy

To more consistently keep creatinine low and eGFR above 95 mL/min/1.73m², a hypothesis will be tested:
*   **Protocol:** Increase flaxseed intake for the next blood test.
*   **Expected Outcome:** Increased omega-3 intake and a potential further decrease in creatinine.
*   **Rationale:** Flaxseeds have a 'net correlative score' of +4, meaning they positively influence four other biomarkers related to aging and all-cause mortality risk, suggesting an increase in flaxseed intake may improve creatinine without negatively impacting other health markers.
