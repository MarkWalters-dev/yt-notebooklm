# 2020-09-08 Dietary AGE Products Impact Insulin Resistance Inflammation And Lifespan

### Executive Summary
*   Dietary Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs), such as N6-carboxymethyl lysine (CML) and methylglyoxal, are formed during high-temperature cooking and are prevalent in many processed and well-cooked foods.
*   In mice, a low-AGE diet increased both average and maximal lifespan, improved insulin sensitivity, and reduced inflammation. Conversely, a high-AGE diet shortened lifespan even when combined with calorie restriction.
*   Human randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicate that a low-AGE diet can decrease insulin resistance (measured by HOMA-IR) and lower levels of inflammation (measured by TNF-alpha).
*   Observational human studies link higher dietary CML intake to an increased risk of pancreatic cancer in men and breast cancer in women.
*   One study reported a decreased risk of non-cancer, non-cardiovascular disease mortality in men with the highest dietary CML intake, highlighting the need for more research on AGEs' impact on overall mortality.

## Introduction to Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs)

Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs) are molecules formed when sugars react with proteins or fats without enzymatic mediation. These reactions are significantly accelerated by heat.

### AGE Formation Process
Bread -> Heat -> Browning/Crisping -> Formation of AGE Products

Two key AGE products frequently discussed are N6-carboxymethyl lysine (CML) and methylglyoxal (MG).

### Dietary Sources of AGEs
High-temperature cooking (above 100°C or 212°F) significantly increases AGE content in foods.

*   **Cashews:**
    *   Raw: 670 units of CML per 100g
    *   Roasted: ~3,000 units of CML per 100g
*   **Sunflower Seeds:**
    *   Roasting increases CML content by approximately 2,000 units.
*   **Beef:**
    *   Raw beef contains relatively low CML.
    *   Broiling or grilling can lead to a tenfold increase in CML.
    *   Pan-frying can result in a fourteenfold increase in CML.
    *   **Healthier preparation methods:** Stewing beef (cooking at a lower temperature for a longer period) results in about threefold less AGE content compared to broiling/grilling, and four-to-fivefold less than pan-frying, representing only a three-and-a-half-fold increase compared to raw beef.

## Mouse Data

Studies in male C57BL/6J mice demonstrate the impact of dietary AGEs on lifespan, insulin resistance, and inflammation.

### Impact on Lifespan
*   **Low AGE Diet Study:**
    *   **Methodology:**
        *   Mice were fed either a regular diet (containing normal AGE levels) or a low-AGE diet.
        *   The low-AGE diet was prepared by heating animal pellets at a lower temperature.
        *   Macronutrient composition of both diets was identical; only the AGE content differed (low-AGE diet had half the AGEs).
    *   **Results:** The low-AGE diet increased both average and maximal lifespan compared to the regular AGE diet.
    *   **Food Intake & Body Weight:**
        *   Food intake was not different between the groups, indicating the lifespan extension was not due to calorie restriction.
        *   Body weight in the low-AGE diet-fed mice was lower than the regular AGE diet group for the majority of the study, becoming statistically significant from 96 weeks. This suggests improved metabolism and more efficient nutrient utilization.

*   **High AGE Diet Plus Calorie Restriction (CR) Study:**
    *   **Methodology:**
        *   Three groups: Regular diet, Calorie Restricted (CR) diet, and CR + High AGE diet.
        *   CR diet involved 40% less food intake.
        *   The CR + High AGE diet was created by heating the mouse pellets for longer to increase AGE content, ensuring these mice consumed higher AGEs than the regular CR group, despite calorie restriction.
        *   Macronutrient composition (protein, fat, carbs, calories) was similar across all three diets.
        *   CML and methylglyoxal (MG) levels were similar between the regular and CR groups, but significantly higher in the CR + High AGE group (approximately 2.5-fold increase in daily CML intake compared to CR alone).
    *   **Results:**
        *   CR alone significantly increased average lifespan (from ~100 to ~120 weeks) and maximal lifespan (from ~110 to ~130 weeks).
        *   However, the CR + High AGE diet shortened lifespan compared to the regular CR diet, demonstrating the powerful negative impact of dietary AGEs on longevity even in the context of calorie restriction.

### Impact on Insulin Resistance
*   In 24-month-old mice fed diets for their lifespan:
    *   Mice on the low-AGE diet had approximately half the insulin levels of those on the regular AGE diet.
    *   The HOMA-IR index (a measure of insulin sensitivity) for mice on the regular AGE diet was ~23.7, more than double the value for mice on the low-AGE diet, suggesting greater insulin sensitivity in the low-AGE group.

### Impact on Inflammation
*   Measured TNF-alpha levels, a marker of inflammation:
    *   Regardless of whether mice were on a high-fat (HF) or low-fat (LF) diet, animals fed a low-AGE diet exhibited lower TNF-alpha levels, indicating reduced inflammation.

## Human Evidence

### Insulin Resistance and Inflammation (Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials)
A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing low-AGE diets versus high-AGE diets yielded results consistent with mouse studies:
*   **HOMA-IR:** In five studies, a low-AGE diet decreased HOMA-IR, indicating improved insulin sensitivity.
*   **TNF-alpha:** In six studies, a low-AGE diet led to lower levels of TNF-alpha, indicating reduced inflammation.

### Disease Risk (Observational Studies)
While long-term human lifespan studies for dietary AGEs are challenging, observational data links dietary AGE intake to disease risk.
*   **Pancreatic Cancer in Men:** Higher dietary CML content was associated with increased risk.
    *   In a fully adjusted model, the highest two quintiles (Q4 and Q5) of dietary CML intake were associated with a 54% and 40% increased risk of pancreatic cancer, respectively, compared to the lowest quintile (Q1).
*   **Breast Cancer in Women:** Higher dietary CML content was associated with increased risk.
    *   In a fully adjusted model, the highest two quintiles (Q4 and Q5) of dietary CML intake were associated with a 24% and 30% increased risk for breast cancer, respectively, compared to the lowest quintile (Q1).

### All-Cause Mortality Risk (CONVERSE Data)
One recent study (CONVERSE data) investigated the association between dietary CML and all-cause mortality risk in men and women.
*   **Overall Mortality:** An 11% *decrease* in all-cause mortality risk was reported for men with the highest versus the lowest intake of dietary CML. No association was found for women. This finding contrasts with the hypothesis that dietary AGEs are detrimental to health.
*   **Specific Mortality Causes:**
    *   No significant association was found between dietary CML intake and cancer mortality.
    *   No significant association was found between dietary CML intake and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality.
    *   A significant 26% decreased risk of non-cancer, non-CVD mortality was observed in the fully adjusted model for men with higher dietary CML intake.
*   **Note:** This is the only study reported on the association between dietary AGEs and all-cause mortality, and more data is needed to fully understand this complex relationship.

## Conclusion
The cumulative evidence from animal studies on lifespan extension, improved insulin sensitivity, and reduced inflammation, along with human randomized controlled trials showing similar improvements in insulin resistance and inflammation, supports the hypothesis that reducing dietary AGE products may be an important strategy to improve health. While observational human data suggests links to specific cancer risks, the emerging and mixed data on all-cause mortality highlights the need for further research to fully ascertain the long-term impact of dietary AGEs on human lifespan and overall health outcomes.
