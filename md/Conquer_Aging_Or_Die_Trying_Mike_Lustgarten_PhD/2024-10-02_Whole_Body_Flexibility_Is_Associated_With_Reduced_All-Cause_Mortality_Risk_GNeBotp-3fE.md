# 2024-10-02 Whole Body Flexibility Is Associated With Reduced All-Cause Mortality Risk

## Executive Summary
*   Whole body flexibility, as measured by the "flex index" (a composite score of range of motion across 20 movements), declines with age.
*   Both men and women with higher flex index scores demonstrate significantly improved survival rates compared to those with lower scores.
*   Women, across all age groups studied, exhibited greater whole body flexibility than men.
*   While the data is suggestive, further research is needed to determine if whole body flexibility is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality risk, or if its association is confounded by other fitness metrics like VO2 max and muscle strength.
*   Currently, there are no randomized controlled trials to establish a causal link between improving whole body flexibility and health outcomes or longevity.

## Previous Findings on Fitness and Mortality Risk
*   Higher grip strength is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (ACM). A meta-analysis of 42 studies involving over 3 million people showed a 65% reduced risk of death for all causes at grip strength greater than 54 kilograms.
*   Higher VO2 max is also associated with a reduced ACM risk. A study with approximately 750,000 participants indicated a 76% reduced risk of death for all causes in individuals with a VO2 max of 50 compared to those with a VO2 max of 16.

## Whole Body Flexibility and its Measurement (Flex Index)
The "flex index" is a metric designed to assess whole body flexibility. It evaluates the range of motion (ROM) across 20 different movements that encompass major joints, including the ankle, knee, hip, trunk, wrist, elbow, and shoulder. Each of these 20 movements is scored on a scale from 0 (lowest) to 4 (highest).

## Flexibility Changes with Aging
Whole body flexibility, as indicated by the flex index, declines with increasing age. A study involving approximately 3,100 individuals aged 46 to 65 years demonstrated this trend. For both men and women, flex index scores decreased with age. In this study, women consistently exhibited higher whole body flexibility than men at any given age.

## Association Between Flex Index and All-Cause Mortality
Higher flex index scores are associated with improved survival.

### Men
*   When comparing the group with the lowest flex index scores to the baseline, 50% had died by the median survival time.
*   In contrast, for the group with the highest flexibility index scores, only 14% had died by the same time point.
*   The intermediate flexibility group had approximately 19% mortality by the median survival time.
*   These findings indicate that both high and intermediate levels of whole body flexibility are associated with significantly improved survival in men compared to the lowest flexibility group.

### Women
*   Due to no groups reaching 50% survival by the study's end, 60% survival was used as a comparison point.
*   At the 60% survival time, individuals in the lowest scoring group had 40% mortality.
*   The highest flexibility index score group for women had only 3-4% mortality at this time.
*   The intermediate flexibility group showed approximately 12% mortality.
*   Similar to men, women with both high and intermediate flexibility demonstrated significantly higher survival rates compared to the lowest flexibility group.

## Potential Confounding Factors and Future Research
*   **Healthy User Bias:** The observed association might be influenced by "healthy user bias," where individuals with better flexibility also engage in other healthy behaviors, leading to higher VO2 max and strength.
*   **Model Adjustments:** Survival models were adjusted for age, BMI, and health status (including cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory disease, diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia). However, these models were *not* adjusted for overall fitness status (e.g., VO2 max or muscle strength).
*   **Future Studies Needed:** Future research should include adjustments for VO2 max and indices of muscle strength to better elucidate the independent contribution of whole body flexibility to all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Causation:** The current data is correlational and does not establish causation. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine if improving whole body flexibility leads to better health outcomes and longevity.
