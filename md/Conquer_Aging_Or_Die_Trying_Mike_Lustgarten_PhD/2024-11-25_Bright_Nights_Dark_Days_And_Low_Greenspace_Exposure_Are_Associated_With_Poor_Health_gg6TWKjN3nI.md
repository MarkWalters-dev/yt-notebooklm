# 2024-11-25 Bright Nights Dark Days And Low Greenspace Exposure Are Associated With Poor Health

## Executive Summary

*   Exposure to bright light during nighttime hours is associated with increased mortality risk.
*   Daytime light exposure, conversely, is linked to reduced mortality.
*   Living in or spending time in green spaces is associated with significant health benefits, including reduced risks of chronic diseases and premature death.
*   Increasing infrared light exposure through planting trees in urban areas can lead to measurable improvements in cardiovascular health markers.
*   Exposure to natural green spaces is associated with reduced stress markers like salivary cortisol.

## Human Evidence: Light Exposure and Mortality

This study, published in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, analyzed data from approximately 88,000 individuals in the UK Biobank. Participants wore devices that measured light exposure at all hours of the day over an eight-year period.

### Key Findings on Light Exposure Timing:

*   **Dose-Response Relationship:** Higher levels of light exposure during the daytime (70th to 100th percentile) were associated with increasingly lower mortality risks compared to those in the 50th percentile or less. This suggests a dose-response effect.
*   **Nighttime Light Detrimental:** Bright light exposure between midnight and 7:00 AM was found to be detrimental, increasing mortality risk.
*   **Beneficial Light Hours:** Light exposure became beneficial around 9:00 PM.
*   **Disease Specificity:** These findings were consistent across all-cause mortality, cardiometabolic mortality, and other causes of mortality.

### Recommendations:

*   Maintain a dark environment during late night and early morning hours when the central circadian pacemaker is most sensitive to light.
*   Seek bright light exposure during the day to enhance circadian rhythms.
*   Protecting lighting environments may be particularly important in settings like intensive care units or aged care facilities.
*   In the general population, avoiding night light and seeking daylight may reduce disease burden, especially cardiometabolic diseases, and increase longevity.

## Human Evidence: Green Space Exposure and Health Outcomes

Decades of research have shown that individuals living in green spaces experience better health outcomes. This is further supported by recent analyses.

### Observed Health Benefits of Green Space Exposure:

*   28% reduction in Type 2 diabetes risk.
*   16% reduction in cardiovascular mortality.
*   31% reduction in total mortality.

### Evidence Addressing Confounding Factors:

A study in South Louisville, Kentucky, investigated the impact of green space creation directly.

*   **Intervention:** 8,000 mature trees were planted in a four-square-mile area.
*   **Outcome Measurement:** C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, a marker for cardiovascular disease, were measured before and after tree planting.
*   **Results:** Two to three years after planting, CRP levels in the same population showed a 13% reduction. This reduction was comparable to the effect of regular exercise three times a week.

### Meta-Analysis Findings on Green Space Benefits:

A meta-analysis of studies on green space exposure revealed diverse and significant health benefits:

*   Reduced risk of:
    *   Type 2 diabetes
    *   Cardiovascular disease
    *   Premature death
    *   Preterm birth
*   Increased sleep duration.
*   Reduced blood pressure, heart rate, and stress.
*   Significantly reduced levels of salivary cortisol (a physiological marker of stress).
