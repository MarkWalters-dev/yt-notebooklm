# 2025-04-08 Does Methylene Blue Impact Lifespan

## Executive Summary
*   The Interventions Testing Program (ITP), a gold standard for mouse lifespan studies across three sites, evaluated methylene blue's impact on longevity.
*   Methylene blue was administered at 28 milligrams per kilogram of food, starting at four months of age.
*   In male mice, methylene blue showed no significant impact on either median or maximum lifespan.
*   In female mice, methylene blue had no significant effect on median lifespan.
*   However, female mice treated with methylene blue exhibited a 6% longer maximum lifespan, a statistically significant finding (p < 0.05).

## Study Methodology
The Interventions Testing Program (ITP) serves as the gold standard for evaluating lifespan interventions in mice. This program conducts survival experiments at three distinct test sites: the University of Michigan, Jackson Laboratory, and the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. Data from these sites are pooled, involving a large number of mice, to ensure robust and reliable findings.

## Methylene Blue Intervention
Mice in the intervention group received methylene blue mixed into their food at a concentration of 28 milligrams per kilogram of food. The administration of methylene blue began when the mice were four months old.

## Mouse Lifespan Data

### Median Lifespan
Median lifespan is defined as the age at which 50% of the mice in a group are still alive.

*   **Male Mice:** There was no significant impact of methylene blue on the median lifespan of male mice (p > 0.05).
*   **Female Mice:** Similarly, methylene blue did not significantly impact the median lifespan of female mice (p > 0.05).

In summary, for both male and female mice, methylene blue did not extend median lifespan.

### Maximum Lifespan
Maximum lifespan is evaluated by looking at the age at which 10% of the mice are still alive (90% mortality).

*   **Male Mice:** Methylene blue had no significant impact on the maximum lifespan of male mice (p = 0.06). While the lifespan curve for methylene blue-treated males showed a slight, non-significant shift towards a shorter lifespan, the difference was not statistically significant.
*   **Female Mice:** In female mice, methylene blue led to a 6% longer maximum lifespan. This increase was statistically significant (p < 0.05).
