# 2024-12-22 Longevity Biohacker Kenneth Scott is 82 - Rejuvenation Approach

### Executive Summary

*   **Dietary Foundation:** Kenneth Scott, 82, adheres to a whole foods plant-based diet (Esselstyn's "no fish, no meat, no dairy, no added oils") as a cornerstone of his longevity approach, leading to significant weight loss, cholesterol reduction, allergy reversal, and improved cognitive function.
*   **Khavinson Peptides:** He regularly uses 5-7 short-chain peptides monthly, reporting general physiological improvements and referencing studies indicating doubled or tripled survival rates in peer groups over 3-5 years.
*   **Follistatin Gene Therapy:** A single injection of MiniCircle plasmids two years ago resulted in a sustained increase in follistatin, leading to improved lean muscle mass (4-5 lbs), enhanced cardiovascular capacity (allowing him to run and dance), and sustained benefits, representing a truly rejuvenative therapy.
*   **VSELs (Very Small Embryonic Like Stem Cells) Activation:** Undergoes a procedure to activate dormant VSELs from his own blood using specific laser light, reinjecting them to promote systemic tissue repair and organ function improvements, including better digestion, brain function, and joint repair.
*   **Senolytics & Other Approaches:** Utilizes a Dasatinib + Quercetin regimen every two months to target senescent cells, maintaining a very low senescent cell burden. He also uses a peptide-based skin cream (OneSkin) that eliminates senescent cells in the skin and is experimenting with D+Q shampoo for hair.
*   **Advocacy & Future Therapies:** Actively invests in and advocates for systemic, rejuvenative therapies that reverse age-related damage, such as Repair Biotechnologies for atherosclerotic plaque removal and Mitrix for mitochondrial transfusion, emphasizing the need for a shift from treating diseases of aging to actively reversing them.

Kenneth Scott, 82, is a software developer, mathematician, biohacker, and a seed investor in biotech companies addressing age-related diseases. His mission is to challenge the conventional approach to health and lifespan by emphasizing rejuvenation as the ultimate goal for achieving longevity.

## Personal Longevity Journey & Diet

Kenneth's interest in longevity began at age 22 after his grandfather's decline and death from heart disease, diabetes, and dementia. This motivated him to avoid a similar path.

**Early Life & Diet:**
Born in Scotland during World War II, Kenneth's early diet was characterized by caloric restriction and a whole foods plant-based approach due to food scarcity. For the first 15-20 years of his life, his diet consisted of vegetables, with no meat or fish, and all food was organic. He believes this foundational diet contributed to a fundamentally healthier body compared to later generations exposed to processed and non-organic foods.

**Evolution of Interest & Health Challenges:**
*   **Physical Fitness:** He maintained physical fitness through non-competitive activities like jogging, tennis, and skiing from his twenties.
*   **Early Influences:** His interest was reignited around age 40 (1982) after reading "Life Extension" by Dirk Pearson and Sandy Shaw, which focused on exercise and supplements.
*   **Self-Discovery of Gluten Sensitivity:** In 2002, suffering from chronic sinus infections and frustrated by years of antibiotics and antihistamines, he recalled his grandmother's advice ("you are what you eat"). He
    *   Fasted for about a week, and his sinus infection cleared.
    *   Upon reintroducing bread, his sinuses plugged up.
    *   Discovered he had a gluten sensitivity.
*   This experience led him to emphasize listening to one's body and taking personal responsibility for medical care, viewing medical practitioners as junior partners in managing one's health.

**Dietary Transformation (Post-Stents):**
Despite a generally cautious diet, Kenneth developed cardiovascular issues, necessitating stents. A year after his father's passing, he read "Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease" by Caldwell Esselstyn Jr. This book profoundly impacted his dietary choices.

**Prior Diet (before Esselstyn's approach):**
*   Breakfast: Typically bacon and eggs.
*   Lunch: Often skipped.
*   Dinner: Skipped every other day; on other days, a nice steak, potatoes, vegetables, and wine.
*   Generally heavy on meats and fats.

**Health Outcome on Prior Diet:**
*   Weight gain from ~120 lbs (age 20) to 145 lbs (age 60s), with accumulated fat.
*   Cardiovascular issues requiring stents.

**Esselstyn Diet & Results:**
*   **Protocol:** Adopted a whole foods plant-based diet following Esselstyn's simple rule: "no fish, no meat, no dairy, no added oils."
*   **Results:**
    *   **Cholesterol:** Total cholesterol dropped from 200-220 to 160 within 4-6 weeks and remains stable.
    *   **Weight Loss:** Lost 25 lbs (15% of body weight, primarily fat) in about 3 months, with a 5-inch reduction in belt size. His BMI is 17.9, which he considers normal.
    *   **Allergies:** Completely lost allergic reactions to dogs and cats; significantly reduced sensitivity to plant pollens (e.g., goldenrod).
    *   **Cognitive Improvement:** Experienced spontaneous German thought processes after 30 years, suggesting improved cognitive clarity.
    *   **Cardiovascular Reversal:** Esselstyn's angiographic evidence of arterial blockage reversal convinced him. He reflected that his own stents might have been avoided if he had adopted this diet earlier.

Kenneth encourages individuals with cardiovascular disease, obesity, or cancer to try this diet for 1-2 months as a low-cost, high-impact intervention. He emphasizes that taste preferences are acquired and can be "disacquired" within about a week to break addiction to hyper-palatable processed foods.

**Current Diet & Eating Window:**
*   **Intermittent Fasting:** His eating window is typically from 12 PM to 7 PM, resulting in a 17-hour daily fast.
*   **Morning:** Decaffeinated black coffee; occasionally gluten-free toast with peanut butter if hungry after a workout.
*   **Lunch:** Usually a varied salad (e.g., five-bean salad, red pepper, corn, lettuce, blueberries, papaya, kimchi, hummus, blue corn chips for grains) and homemade lentil soup.
*   **Dinner:** Rotates through 7-8 plant-based dishes, with occasional wild-caught salmon (once a week for his wife's health) and very small amounts of dairy (e.g., mozzarella). Examples include scrambled tofu on gluten-free toast, baked beans on toast, or rice with Indian curry.
*   **Snacks:** Limited walnuts and mixed nuts; avoids seed oils, uses minimal olive oil.

**Family Longevity & Vitality:**
Kenneth's parents died at 68 (Parkinson's, heart attack) and 88 (suffering decline from mini-strokes). His paternal grandfather died at 62, while his paternal grandmother lived to 96, remaining active. His maternal grandparents died from medical issues in their early years. His three siblings, aged 72, 80, and 87, are all alive but largely dependent on the medical system for ongoing cardiovascular and neurological issues. In contrast, Kenneth emphasizes his current vitality: traveling to multiple countries, driving independently, and maintaining high physical stamina, which he considers rare for someone his age.

## Rejuvenation Technologies & Therapies

Kenneth's approach focuses on systemic, rejuvenative therapies that empower the body to repair itself, ideally through infrequent, long-lasting interventions.

### Khavinson Peptides

*   **Description:** Short-chain peptides (2-4 amino acids) developed by Russian scientist V. Khavinson, targeting specific organs and systems.
*   **Protocol:**
    *   Takes 5-7 different peptides (e.g., Bisolutin for eyes, Sirlutin for brain) monthly.
    *   Each peptide is taken as 2 capsules daily for 10 days.
    *   Cost: ~$350/month.
*   **Results:**
    *   **Vision:** Bisolutin temporarily improves his vision, allowing him to read without glasses.
    *   **Cognition:** Sirlutin had a profound impact on his wife's cognitive function within a day or two of initial use.
    *   **Overall Survival:** Studies in Russia indicated that this program, taken for 3-5 years, could double or triple survival rates in peer groups.

### Follistatin Gene Therapy

*   **Description:** Follistatin is a naturally occurring protein that inhibits myostatin, promoting muscle growth and countering age-related muscle/bone loss (sarcopenia, osteoporosis).
*   **Mechanism (MiniCircle approach):**
    *   **Injection:** Plasmids (circular DNA strands) encoded to produce follistatin are injected into the abdomen.
    *   **Replication:** These plasmids replicate, creating a "follistatin factory" within the body.
    *   **Safety:** Includes a "killer switch" DNA sequence that allows the therapy to be turned off with an injection of a specific drug (e.g., doxycycline) if severe adverse reactions occur.
*   **Kenneth's Protocol & Results (n=1):**
    *   Received a single injection two years ago (offshore in Honduras).
    *   **Follistatin Levels:** Blood serum follistatin levels doubled in 3 months and increased by another 50% in the subsequent 3 months.
    *   **Muscle Mass:** DEXA scans showed an increase of 4-5 lbs in lean muscle mass.
    *   **Physical Function:** Regained the ability to run (couldn't before) and significantly improved his stamina for dancing.
    *   **Nature of Rejuvenation:** The sustained benefits from a single, 30-second injection after two years demonstrate a truly rejuvenative and systemic therapy, allowing his body to allocate the resource (follistatin) where needed most (e.g., heart, improving cardiovascular capacity).

### VSELs (Very Small Embryonic Like Stem Cells)

*   **Description:** Dormant, very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) are present in adult blood, discovered through research in Cambridge, England. These cells can be reactivated.
*   **Protocol:**
    1.  **Blood Sample:** 60-70 cc of blood is drawn.
    2.  **PRP Extraction:** Centrifugation isolates Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP), which contains VSELs.
    3.  **Activation:** The PRP/VSELs are activated using a specific frequency of laser light (SONG laser).
    4.  **Reinjection:** The activated VSELs are reinjected intravenously (IV push) for systemic distribution.
    5.  **Targeting:** Specific areas of the body (e.g., vagus nerve, brain, knee) can also be radiated with the same laser light to attract VSELs to those sites.
*   **Kenneth's Results (n=1):**
    *   **Digestion:** After vagus nerve treatment, his digestive system significantly improved overnight.
    *   **Joint Repair:** A 40-year-old injury to his right knee was repaired in about a week.
*   **Wife's Results (n=1):**
    *   **Cognition:** Following brain treatment, his wife, who suffered cognitive impairment from Cipro, showed profound improvement in mental clarity and executive function within 24 hours.
*   **Safety:** Considered very safe as it uses the individual's own blood treated with light.

### Exosomes (Amniotic Fluid)

*   **Description:** Small signaling particles derived from amniotic fluid of full-term healthy baby births. These exosomes are filtered to be very small (<125 nm) to avoid immune system reactions.
*   **Source:** Center for Regenerative Medicine (CRM) in Miami.
*   **Protocol:** Injected. Kenneth and his wife have each undergone about half a dozen treatments.
*   **Results:**
    *   **Kenneth:** Experienced a significant energy "high" after his first treatment.
    *   **Wife:** After suffering continuous tendon pain from Cipro damage, she experienced immense pain reduction within three weeks of exosome treatment.
*   **Availability:** Available in the United States (off-label use by physicians).

### Senolytics (Dasatinib + Quercetin - D+Q)

*   **Description:** A combination of Dasatinib (a cancer drug) and Quercetin (a flavonoid) designed to selectively eliminate senescent ("zombie") cells, which accumulate with age and contribute to tissue dysfunction.
*   **Protocol:**
    *   Kenneth and his wife take 50 mg of Dasatinib and 1000 mg of Quercetin once every two months.
    *   This regimen maintains Kenneth's senescent cell burden at a very low level.
*   **Experimental Topical Use (Hair):**
    *   Inspired by Mayo Clinic research on D+Q shampoo to extend the wool-bearing life of sheep, Kenneth uses a D+Q mixture as a shampoo a couple of times a week, leaving it on for 5 minutes. A friend in London has reported new hair growth from a similar protocol.
*   **Skin Care (OneSkin):**
    *   Kenneth uses OneSkin, a peptide-based skin cream designed to penetrate the dermis and kill senescent cells. He observed the disappearance of age spots within three months of use during a beta test, and these spots did not reappear even after a six-month break from use.

### Future Rejuvenation Therapies (Investments/Plans)

Kenneth is actively invested in and pursuing several cutting-edge rejuvenative therapies, often facing regulatory hurdles.

*   **Repair Biotechnologies (Atherosclerotic Plaque Removal):**
    *   **Description:** This company is developing an enzyme-based platform that catabolizes (breaks down) atherosclerotic plaque into water-soluble components, allowing the body to flush them out.
    *   **Mechanism:** The enzyme is administered via injections, aiming for systemic, infrequent treatment to truly reverse cardiovascular damage (e.g., every 5 years).
    *   **Status:** Currently in mouse and non-human primate trials. Kenneth hopes to receive this offshore within the next year, aiming to restore his carotid artery health, which showed slight age progression despite his diet.
*   **Mitrix (Mitochondrial Transfusion):**
    *   **Description:** Focuses on restoring cellular energy by replacing damaged mitochondria with healthy, youthful mitochondria.
    *   **Mechanism:** Involves taking mitochondria from a young person in the recipient's maternal line, replicating them in a lab, and then transplanting them into the recipient's body (likely via IV injection).
    *   **Status:** Mitrix recently received FDA approval for the first human trial, involving a boy with a genetic mitochondrial defect, anticipated within the next six months. Kenneth is participating in the program by having his mitochondrial DNA analyzed.
*   **LentoBio (Presbyopia Reversal):**
    *   **Description:** Developing an eye drop that will break down cross-links in the eye lens, restoring its flexibility and thereby reversing presbyopia (the need for reading glasses).
    *   **Impact:** Aims to provide an inexpensive, non-surgical solution that could restore vision for several years with a few months of treatment, addressing a common age-related condition globally.

## Advocacy for Rejuvenation Research

Kenneth critiques the current landscape of medical research and regulation:
*   **Focus on Disease vs. Rejuvenation:** He believes disproportionate funding is allocated to treating diseases of aging (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer), which he sees as largely preventable through diet, rather than on proactive rejuvenative technologies.
*   **Impact of Scientific Paradigms:** While Aubrey de Grey's "repair" approach (exemplified by the hallmarks of aging) has dominated the longevity field since 2013, Kenneth argues that the potential of Yamanaka's work (2006) on cellular reprogramming – demonstrating the body's capacity for true age reversal – has not been sufficiently embraced.
*   **Regulatory Obstacles:** He finds FDA regulations to be a major roadblock, especially for rejuvenative therapies. He notes the bureaucratic tendency to prioritize avoiding mistakes over enabling potentially life-saving innovations, exemplified by the long approval processes for treatments like atherosclerotic plaque removal, while hundreds of thousands die from the condition annually. He asserts that individuals should have the right to make informed choices about interventions for their own bodies, especially when current options offer only maintenance, not reversal, of age-related decline.

Kenneth's core belief is that "you were born to live, not to die." He sees rejuvenation as harnessing the intrinsic desire of cells to remain alive and functional, moving beyond simply extending lifespan to actively restoring youthful vitality.
