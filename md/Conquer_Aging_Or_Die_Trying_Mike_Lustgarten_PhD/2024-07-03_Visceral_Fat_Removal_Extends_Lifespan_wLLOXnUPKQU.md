# 2024-07-03 Visceral Fat Removal Extends Lifespan

## Executive Summary
*   Surgical removal of visceral fat (VF) in rats significantly extended both median and maximal lifespan, an effect independent of overall body weight changes compared to *ad libitum* fed controls.
*   Calorie Restriction (CR) resulted in the lowest VF levels, suggesting that at least 20% of CR's lifespan extension benefit may be attributable to VF limitation.
*   In humans, median visceral fat mass increases significantly with age; for instance, VF mass increases roughly five-fold in women and four-fold in men between ages 20 and 70.
*   VF mass in the speaker (age 51) was 263 grams, placing him in the lower range for his age group, comparable to levels seen in 20- to 50-year-olds.
*   Visceral fat levels in rats that had VF surgically removed were comparable to those achieved by rats on a 40% Calorie Restriction diet, despite the surgically treated group eating *ad libitum*.

## Rat Study: Visceral Fat Removal and Lifespan

Visceral fat removal was performed on rats at five months of age. Longevity outcomes were assessed 15 months post-surgery. Three experimental groups were compared:

1.  **VF Removed (VF-R):** Visceral fat surgically removed; rats allowed to eat *ad libitum* (AL).
2.  **Ad Libitum (AL):** Rats allowed to eat as much as they wanted, whenever they wanted.
3.  **Calorie Restricted (CR):** Rats maintained on a 40% Calorie Restriction diet.

### Visceral Fat Mass at 20 Months of Age (15 Months Post-Surgery)

| Group | Visceral Fat Mass (Approx.) | Comparison Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| VF Removed | 9 grams | Minimal accumulation post-surgery. |
| CR (40%) | 5.9 grams | Not significantly different from the VF-R group. |
| AL | ~27 grams (3x higher) | Significantly higher than both VF-R and CR groups. |

### Body Weight Comparison (AL vs. VF-R vs. CR)

*   Body weight in the **VF-R** group was not significantly different from the **AL** group.
*   Both the **VF-R** and **AL** groups had significantly higher body weights than the **CR** group.

This suggests that the lifespan effect observed in the VF-R group might be independent of calorie restriction, as their body weight mirrored the AL controls.

### Survival Analysis

The VF-R group showed significant extensions in both median (50% survival) and maximal (80% survival) lifespan compared to the AL group. However, the CR group exhibited the longest overall lifespan.

**Implication:** Since the CR group achieved the lowest VF levels naturally, it suggests that limiting visceral fat accumulation accounts for at least 20% of the lifespan-extending effect attributed to calorie restriction in rats.

## Human Visceral Fat Accumulation During Aging

Data comparing visceral fat mass (VFM) in men and women across aging shows a clear trend of accumulation.

### Visceral Fat Mass (VFM) by Age Group

*   **Trend:** Median VFM increases substantially with age in both sexes between 20 and 90 years.
*   **Women (20 to 70 years):** Median VFM increased from approximately 200 grams to 1,000 grams (a five-fold increase).
*   **Men (20 to 70 years):** Median VFM increased from approximately 500 grams to 2,000 grams (a four-fold increase).

The longevity goal is to maintain low visceral fat levels and mitigate this age-related increase.

### Speaker's Current Visceral Fat Data (as of December 2023)

*   **Chronological Age:** $\approx 51$ years
*   **Visceral Fat Mass (VFM):** $0.58$ pounds ($\approx 263$ grams)

**Contextualization:**
The speaker's current VFM level of 263 grams is:
*   Below the average VFM for a 51-year-old male.
*   Comparable to the VFM levels observed in individuals ranging from 20 to 50 years of age.

The stated goal is to maintain low visceral fat levels for as long as physically possible to observe potential longevity impacts.
