# 2024-05-01 What s The Association For VO2Max With Life Expectancy Podcast Clip With Unaging.com

## Executive Summary

*   Achieving a high VO2 max (e.g., >50 mL/kg/min) is strongly associated with a significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk; the least fit group (VO2 max ~17) showed a four-fold higher risk compared to the extremely fit.
*   While very high VO2 max (e.g., ~51) offers further mortality reduction compared to merely "high fit" (e.g., ~42), this incremental benefit is often smaller than widely publicized, particularly across different age groups (e.g., 6-15% difference in risk reduction).
*   High VO2 max, even exceeding 50 mL/kg/min, typically correlates with an average life expectancy in the high 70s to low 80s, suggesting that achieving maximal human lifespan requires additional targeted strategies beyond cardiorespiratory fitness alone.
*   Maintaining a high VO2 max is achievable with moderate, consistent exercise (e.g., two 30-minute runs per week combined with other training) without necessarily becoming an elite endurance athlete.
*   An optimal exercise strategy for longevity should consider not just maximizing VO2 max, but also optimizing biomarkers like high heart rate variability (HRV) and low resting heart rate (RHR), while avoiding overtraining.

## VO2 Max and Mortality Risk

A recent study compared six fitness levels, from least fit (VO2 max ~17 mL/kg/min) to extremely fit (VO2 max ~51 mL/kg/min), using METs (metabolic equivalents) to quantify fitness. The data indicated that the least fit group demonstrated a four-fold higher risk of all-cause mortality compared to the extremely fit group. This finding underscores the significant association between higher VO2 max and reduced mortality risk.

## Nuances of Fitness Levels and Risk

While having an extremely high VO2 max (e.g., 51 mL/kg/min) is beneficial, the difference in mortality risk between the "high fit" group (VO2 max ~42 mL/kg/min) and the "extremely fit" group (VO2 max ~51 mL/kg/min) is less dramatic than sometimes portrayed. The high fit group exhibited a 39% increased risk of death relative to the extremely fit group. This difference was contextualized as being comparable to the 49% increased risk associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) relative to the extremely fit group.

### Age-Specific Analysis

The study included a wide age range, from 30-year-olds up to 95-year-olds, with very large sample sizes across each age group.

*   **Comparison: Extremely Fit (VO2 max ~51) vs. Least Fit (VO2 max ~17)**
    *   For 30-49 year olds, there was an 84% lower risk of all-cause mortality.
    *   For 50-59 year olds, there was a 78% lower risk.
    *   For 60-69 year olds, there was an 80% lower risk.
    *   For 70-79 year olds, there was a 66% lower risk.
    *   For 80-95 year olds, there was a 73% lower risk.
*   **Comparison: Highly Fit (VO2 max ~42) vs. Extremely Fit (VO2 max ~51)**
    *   The additional benefit (lower risk) for the extremely fit over the highly fit was smaller, with only a 6% difference for 50-59 year olds and an 8% difference for 60-69 year olds. Other age groups showed differences up to 15%.

This suggests that while the extremely fit group consistently maintains the lowest risk, the incremental benefit over a highly fit state is not as vast as some interpretations might imply.

## Impact of Fitness Levels on Life Expectancy

The study also investigated the association between VO2 max and average life expectancy:

*   **Men:**
    *   Fit and highly fit groups (VO2 max 35-43 mL/kg/min) lived 4.5 to 5 years longer on average compared to the lowest fit group (VO2 max 17 mL/kg/min).
    *   The extremely fit group (VO2 max >51 mL/kg/min) lived 6 years longer on average compared to the lowest fit group.
    *   The overall average life expectancy for these fitter groups ranged from 73 to 79 years.
*   **Women:**
    *   Fit and highly fit groups (VO2 max 35-40 mL/kg/min) lived 2.5 years longer on average than the lowest fit group.
    *   The highest fit group lived about 7 years longer than the lowest fit group.
    *   The overall average life expectancy for these fitter groups ranged from 69 to 76 years.
*   **Older Adults (70+):** Individuals aged 70 and older with cardiorespiratory fitness greater than 7 METs (VO2 max ~25 mL/kg/min) lived approximately three years longer (87 years on average) compared to the lowest fit group (85 years).

While a higher VO2 max significantly increases average life expectancy, these gains typically place individuals in the high 70s to low 80s, rather than pushing average lifespans into the 90s or beyond 100 years. This indicates a need for additional, more targeted strategies beyond cardiorespiratory fitness alone to achieve maximal human lifespan.

## VO2 Max Measurement and Study Demographics

Accurate VO2 max measurement relies on laboratory tests using a face mask, which provides a direct and reliable assessment, unlike estimated values based on resting heart rate or smart devices. VO2 max is typically expressed as milliliters of oxygen consumed per kilogram of body weight (mL/kg/min), meaning body mass is a crucial denominator in its calculation.

The average BMI within the study groups across all age ranges was in the overweight (BMI 25-30) or obese (BMI 30+) range, often closer to 28-30. This suggests that even individuals who are overweight or obese but attain a high VO2 max (e.g., >50) can still achieve the lowest risk of all-cause mortality, as the study models were adjusted for age, sex, and BMI. The study did not specifically analyze the life expectancy gain for lean individuals with a high VO2 max, likely due to the limited sample size of this specific population.

## Exercise Prescription and Optimal Fitness Markers

Achieving a high VO2 max does not necessarily require becoming an elite endurance athlete. One individual mentioned achieving a VO2 max of 55 (pre-marathon training) with approximately one hour of running per week, combined with other weight training. Another speaker consistently maintained a VO2 max in the low 40s (considered "high fit") from 2012 to 2018 with a regular routine that did not include running:

*   **Protocol:**
    *   90-minute full-body workout.
    *   15-20 miles of walking per week.

### The Long Game and Consistency

Consistently engaging in moderate exercise over time can gradually move individuals into higher fitness categories. Maintaining consistency is crucial, as even short breaks (e.g., a month) can significantly reduce cardiorespiratory fitness, potentially undoing previous gains.

### Beyond VO2 Max

A comprehensive approach to longevity requires looking beyond just VO2 max. Emphasis should be placed on a specific exercise prescription, a tailored dietary prescription, and monitoring biomarkers of organ and systemic function. The ultimate goal is to push beyond typical life expectancy caps (e.g., 87-95 years) observed in current studies.

### Optimizing Exercise Dose

The ideal exercise dose should aim to maximize VO2 max while simultaneously optimizing other key fitness markers. The goal is to achieve high Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and a low Resting Heart Rate (RHR), while actively avoiding overtraining, which can negatively impact these metrics.

An example of an optimized, minimalist protocol for maintaining high fitness levels while balancing other biomarkers includes:

*   **Aerobic Exercise:** Two 30-minute running sessions per week.
*   **Consistency:** Maintained consistently over several years.
*   **Impact:** This approach had no noticeable negative impact on HRV or RHR; in fact, post-exercise days were often associated with better metrics.

The principle is to identify an efficient routine that yields maximum benefit from minimal effort, coupled with unwavering consistency.
