# 2022-05-15 A Physiology Clock for Human Aging - BP and FEV1 As Top Predictors

## Executive Summary

*   Existing blood-based biological age clocks (e.g., Levine's test, aging.ai) have blind spots, as they do not include biomarkers for all organ systems.
*   Recent research identifies **Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)** and **Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1)** as leading predictors of chronological age, often outperforming many blood-based biomarkers.
*   Optimal blood pressure (SBP < 115 mmHg and DBP < 75 mmHg) is associated with a significantly lower brain age, as measured by MRI.
*   Both SBP and FEV1 show consistent age-related trends: SBP generally increases with age, while FEV1 peaks around age 20 and then consistently declines, regardless of smoking status or minor illness.
*   FEV1 can be accurately tracked at home using a spirometer, showing a high correlation (0.96) with clinical measurements.

## Limitations of Current Biological Age Clocks

Blood-based biological age clocks like Levine's test and aging.ai include a range of biomarkers, but do not offer a comprehensive representation of organ or systemic health.

*   **Levine's Test Biomarkers:**
    *   Glucose
    *   Two liver function biomarkers
    *   One kidney function biomarker
    *   Two red blood cell-related markers (MCV, RDW)
    *   Immune cells and inflammation markers (white blood cells, lymphocyte percentage, high sensitivity C-reactive protein)
*   **Aging.ai Biomarkers:**
    *   Glucose
    *   Two liver function markers
    *   Five kidney function markers
    *   Five red blood cell-related measures
    *   Two immune-related biomarkers (total protein, likely reflecting globulins, and platelets)
    *   Lipid panel (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides)

These tests generally lack biomarkers covering all organ systems, highlighting a need for more comprehensive predictors.

## Systolic Blood Pressure and FEV1 as Key Predictors

A recent preprint identified systolic blood pressure (SBP) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) as significant contributors to the prediction of chronological age, often surpassing the predictive power of many blood-based biomarkers.

### FEV1 Definition

FEV1 is a measure of lung function, defined as the amount of air that can be forcefully expired in one second.

### Predictive Power in Women

The top two predictors of chronological age in women were:
1.  Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)
2.  Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1)

SBP and FEV1 contributed more to the prediction of chronological age compared to blood-based biomarkers such as:
*   Kidney function markers (urea, cystatin c)
*   Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)
*   Alkaline phosphatase

### Predictive Power in Men

In men, the top biomarker for predicting chronological age was SBP. FEV1 ranked third in its contribution to chronological age prediction.

Similar to women, SBP and FEV1 contributed more to chronological age prediction relative to other blood-based biomarkers, including kidney function markers (cystatin c, urea).

## Blood Pressure and Brain Age

Beyond its impact on cardiovascular outcomes, blood pressure significantly influences brain age. A study found that optimal blood pressure is associated with a younger brain.

*   **Optimal Blood Pressure Definition:**
    *   Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) less than 115 mmHg
    *   Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) less than 75 mmHg
*   Individuals maintaining optimal blood pressure exhibited a significantly lower brain age, identified through MRI brain scans, compared to those with higher blood pressure.

## Age-Related Changes in Blood Pressure

Blood pressure values change distinctively with age.

*   **Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP):**
    *   Relatively low in youth.
    *   Consistently increases during aging.
    *   Average SBP measurements for individuals older than 90 often exceed 130 mmHg.
*   **Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP):**
    *   Relatively low in youth.
    *   Peaks in middle age.
    *   Declines during advanced aging, resulting in relatively low levels for individuals older than 90.

**Typical Blood Pressure Ranges:**

*   **Youth:** SBP 108-118 mmHg / DBP 65-67 mmHg (depending on sex)
*   **Advanced Age (older than 90):** Average SBP 130-135 mmHg / DBP 68-69 mmHg

Blood pressure is a relatively easy measurement that can be performed at home, offering an advantage over blood-based biomarker tests that require laboratory visits.

## Age-Related Changes in FEV1

Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1), a key measure of lung function, shows a consistent decline with age in both men and women.

*   FEV1 peaks in youth, typically around 20 years of age.
*   It then consistently declines throughout life for both sexes.
*   This age-related decline occurs regardless of health status (e.g., healthy non-smokers, healthy smokers, individuals with common colds or lung disease). While health status can affect the *rate* of decline, the overall trend of decline after age 20 is consistent.

## Tracking FEV1

Tracking FEV1 is a crucial first step to monitor and potentially mitigate its age-related decline.

**FEV1 Measurement:**

*   FEV1 is measured using a **spirometer**.
*   Some spirometers are suitable for home use and have been validated in published studies.
*   Home spirometry shows an almost perfectly linear correlation (correlation coefficient of 0.96) with spirometry performed at a doctor's office.
