# 2020-11-19 Kidney Function - The Missing Link In The TMAO-Health And Disease Story

## Executive Summary

*   Higher plasma levels of trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) are strongly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and all-cause mortality.
*   Despite fish consumption leading to significant spikes in plasma TMAO, meta-analyses consistently show that moderate fish consumption (50-100 g/day) is associated with a *lower* all-cause mortality risk, posing a paradox.
*   Kidney function, measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), is a critical determinant of the association between TMAO and disease risk. For individuals with good kidney function (eGFR > 90), the link between higher TMAO and increased mortality risk disappears.
*   Conversely, in individuals with impaired kidney function (eGFR < 90), higher TMAO levels remain significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality.
*   eGFR typically declines with age, with average levels dropping below 90 around 40 years of age, suggesting that dietary considerations regarding TMAO precursors may become more relevant in middle-aged and older adults.

## Introduction to TMAO

Animal products, including meat, cheese, and eggs, contain carnitine and choline. These metabolites are converted by gut bacteria into trimethylamine (TMA). TMA then travels from the intestine into the blood and subsequently to the liver, where liver enzymes convert it to trimethylamine oxide (TMAO).

**TMAO Metabolic Pathway:**
Animal Products (Carnitine, Choline) -> Gut Bacteria -> Trimethylamine (TMA) -> Blood -> Liver -> Liver Enzymes -> Trimethylamine Oxide (TMAO)

## TMAO and Disease Risk

Higher plasma levels of TMAO are associated with an increased risk for heart attack (myocardial infarction - MI), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), coronary artery disease (CAD), a combination of PAD and CAD, and overall cardiovascular disease.

Data shows that compared to the lowest quartile of TMAO in blood plasma, sequentially higher quartiles are associated with an increased risk for each of these cardiovascular disease-related outcomes.

Beyond cardiovascular issues, higher levels of TMAO are also associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk. Compared to individuals in the lowest TMAO quartile, those in the third and fourth quartiles of plasma TMAO levels exhibited a 71% and 86% increased all-cause mortality risk, respectively.

## The Fish Paradox

Fish directly contains TMAO. This raises the question of how fish consumption contributes to the TMAO story, especially given the established link between TMAO and disease.

**Study Protocol: Dietary Impact on TMAO Levels**
A study investigated plasma TMAO levels after consumption of different meals:
*   Subjects consumed four different meals: fish (haddock), chicken, red meat, or processed meat.
*   Plasma TMAO levels were measured at baseline, 2 hours after eating, and 24 hours after eating, over three different weeks for each meal type.

**Findings:**
*   Consumption of chicken, red meat, and processed meat resulted in low plasma TMAO levels with almost no spike after eating.
*   The fish meal, however, led to dramatically higher plasma TMAO levels compared to baseline and other meats.

**The Paradox:**
If high TMAO levels are directly linked to disease and mortality, one would expect a higher all-cause mortality risk for fish eaters. However, a meta-analysis of approximately 400,000 people across 10 studies showed that the lowest all-cause mortality risk was present for fish consumption in the 50 to 100 grams per day range. This suggests that the relationship between TMAO and health outcomes is not as simple as higher TMAO in blood directly equating to higher disease and mortality risk. Other factors must be involved.

## The Role of Kidney Function

A study investigated the impact of kidney function on the association between TMAO and all-cause mortality risk.

**Study Methodology:**
*   Subjects were separated into two groups based on their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function.
*   eGFR was determined using plasma measurements of creatinine and cystatin c.

**Findings in Subjects with Impaired Kidney Function (eGFR < 90):**
*   The average eGFR in this group was 76.
*   A significant 29% increased all-cause mortality risk was observed for higher plasma TMAO levels, even in unadjusted associations.
*   This association remained statistically significant after adjusting for age, sex, and urinary albumin excretion (another measure of kidney function).

**Findings in Subjects with Good Kidney Function (eGFR > 90):**
*   The average eGFR in this group was 104, indicating good kidney function.
*   No significant association was found between plasma levels of TMAO and all-cause mortality risk, either in unadjusted analyses or when adjusted for age, sex, and urinary albumin excretion.

This data strongly suggests that kidney function plays a critical role in the TMAO story.

**Revisiting Previous CVD Data:**
Earlier studies linking TMAO to an increased risk of heart attack, atherosclerosis, and CVD often adjusted for estimated creatinine clearance, a measure of kidney function. However, the average eGFR in those studies was 73, with a range of 60-86. This falls squarely within the "eGFR < 90" category, where TMAO is consistently associated with increased risk. This further supports the hypothesis that kidney function is a crucial factor in the link between TMAO and risk of disease and death.

**Direct Relationship Between eGFR and Plasma TMAO:**
A clear inverse relationship exists between kidney function and plasma TMAO levels:
*   Individuals with good kidney function (eGFR > 91) had the lowest levels of plasma TMAO.
*   Individuals with the worst kidney function (eGFR = 66) had the highest levels of plasma TMAO.

This indicates that healthy kidneys are efficient at clearing TMAO from the body, thus influencing circulating levels.

## Age-Related Decline in Kidney Function

eGFR naturally declines with age. Data from a study of approximately 378,000 people showed that, on average, eGFR drops to less than 90 around 40 years of age for both men and women.

**Implication:**
If an individual's eGFR is greater than 90, consuming animal products (meat, eggs, cheese) and fish may not pose a significant issue in terms of TMAO-related risk. However, as eGFR levels fall below 90, which commonly occurs around middle age, reducing the consumption of animal products might become a more important strategy for decreasing the risk of TMAO-related health issues.
