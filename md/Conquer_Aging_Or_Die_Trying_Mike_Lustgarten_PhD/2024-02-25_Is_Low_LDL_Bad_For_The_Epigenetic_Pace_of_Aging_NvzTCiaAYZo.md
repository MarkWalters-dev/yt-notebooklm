# 2024-02-25 Is Low LDL Bad For The Epigenetic Pace of Aging

## Executive Summary

*   Dunedin PACE (epigenetic aging rate) was inversely correlated with DHEA sulfate and LDL levels in the speaker's personal data, meaning higher levels of DHEA sulfate and LDL were associated with a slower epigenetic pace of aging.
*   In the speaker's data, LDL levels ranging from 62 to 83 mg/dL showed a significant inverse correlation with Dunedin PACE, with a lower LDL of 65 mg/dL coinciding with the worst recorded Dunedin PACE (0.98).
*   A large-scale study (4.5 million people) on coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality found that in a fully adjusted model, both LDL levels below 65 mg/dL and above 120 mg/dL were associated with an increased risk of CHD mortality.
*   The same large study suggested a relatively safe range for LDL between 65 and 120 mg/dL, associated with the lowest CHD mortality risk.
*   The speaker plans to increase LDL levels slightly (to >85 mg/dL) by increasing total fat and specifically coconut butter intake to test its impact on Dunedin PACE, aiming to stay within the identified safe range for CHD risk.

## Personal Dunedin PACE Data

The speaker has 12 Dunedin PACE tests. An average of three Dunedin PACE measurements over six months is required for leaderboard ranking. Over a recent six-month period (ending January 2024), the speaker had six tests. The average Dunedin PACE over this period was 0.81. Two of the most recent tests were lower, at 0.75 and 0.74.

## Dietary Correlations with Dunedin PACE

To identify factors correlated with Dunedin PACE, the speaker analyzed dietary intake.

**Methodology for Dietary Tracking:**
*   Since 2015, all food intake was weighed using a food scale.
*   Daily food amounts were entered into Cronometer.
*   Data was manually logged into a spreadsheet.
*   For each blood test, a corresponding 60-day average dietary intake was calculated from daily tracking.
*   Correlations between dietary intake and biomarkers (including Dunedin PACE) were calculated.
*   Statistical significance was defined as a p-value less than 0.05.

**Findings:**
A 12-test analysis of 97 comparisons between foods, macro-, and micronutrients with Dunedin PACE found no statistically significant correlations (p < 0.05). The strongest correlation observed was with Vitamin B6, but its p-value was 0.1, which is outside the threshold for significance.

## Biomarker Correlations with Dunedin PACE

To gain deeper insight into potential mechanisms impacting Dunedin PACE, correlations with other blood biomarkers were investigated.

**Methodology:**
*   23 commonly tracked biomarkers were analyzed.
*   Nine to eleven tests corresponded for standard blood biomarkers on the same day as Dunedin PACE testing.
*   Standard blood biomarkers were measured via venipuncture, while Dunedin PACE was measured via a finger prick test.
*   Specifically, there were 11 matching tests for most biomarkers, 9 for DHEA sulfate, and 10 for aging.ai (a discontinued measure).

**Findings:**
Four biomarkers showed a significant correlation with Dunedin PACE:
*   Liver enzymes (AST + ALT)
*   Platelets
*   **DHEA sulfate:** Significantly inversely correlated (higher DHEA sulfate -> slower epigenetic pace of aging). The speaker noted their DHEA sulfate levels are currently closer to age-expected rather than youthful levels previously observed.
*   **LDL:** Significantly inversely correlated (higher LDL -> slower epigenetic pace of aging).

## LDL and Epigenetic Pace of Aging

A detailed analysis of 11 tests for Dunedin PACE versus LDL concentration showed a significant inverse correlation. This indicates that relatively higher LDL concentrations were associated with a slower epigenetic pace of aging, while lower LDL was associated with a faster epigenetic pace of aging.

The LDL range observed in these data was from 62 to 83 mg/dL.
One specific data point of interest involved high-dose nicotinic acid (600 mg/day), which was associated with the speaker's worst Dunedin PACE score to date (0.98). On this occasion, LDL was 65 mg/dL. This suggests a hypothesis that high-dose nicotinic acid may have reduced LDL to a level that negatively impacted the epigenetic pace of aging.

## LDL and Coronary Heart Disease Risk

Given the inverse correlation between LDL and Dunedin PACE, the potential impact of increasing LDL on coronary heart disease (CHD) risk was considered.

A large study involving approximately 4.5 million people investigated the hazard ratio for CHD mortality across different serum LDL levels. This study was notable for its large sample size and comprehensive adjustment for comorbidities.

**Study Models and Findings:**
*   **Model 1 (Minimally Adjusted):** Adjusted for age, sex, race, and smoking status. An LDL of 120 mg/dL was associated with approximately a 20% reduced CHD mortality risk.
*   **Model 2 (Partially Adjusted):** Included statin use, BMI, hypertension, and diabetes in addition to Model 1 adjustments. An LDL of 120 mg/dL was then associated with approximately a 10% reduced CHD mortality risk.
*   **Model 3 (Fully Adjusted):** This model adjusted for a wide range of comorbidities, including HDL, preexisting coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, stroke, anemia, liver disease, kidney disease, lung disease, cancer, depression, and dementia. Data for individuals who died within the first two years were excluded to minimize confounding by very sick individuals.
    *   In this fully adjusted model, an LDL of 120 mg/dL was no longer significantly associated with a reduced risk for CHD mortality.
    *   LDL levels greater than 120 mg/dL were associated with a significantly increased CHD mortality risk.
    *   Crucially, LDL levels less than 65 mg/dL were also associated with an increased CHD mortality risk.

Based on this study, a relatively safe range for LDL, associated with the lowest risk for CHD mortality, appears to be between 65 and 120 mg/dL. This finding supports the hypothesis that very low LDL (e.g., 65 mg/dL, as seen during high-dose nicotinic acid use) might not only be suboptimal for the epigenetic pace of aging but also potentially increase CHD mortality risk.

## Future Experiment: Increasing LDL

The speaker aims to raise LDL levels to greater than 85 mg/dL (e.g., 90-95 mg/dL) to test its effect on Dunedin PACE, while remaining within the 65-120 mg/dL range identified as safe for CHD risk.

**Experiment Protocol:**
*   Increase total fat intake, which has been correlated with LDL levels in the speaker's data.
*   Specifically, increase coconut butter intake, identified as a major source of saturated fat and significantly correlated with LDL in the speaker's data.
*   Maintain higher coconut butter intake for at least two weeks leading up to the next test.
*   The next Dunedin PACE test is scheduled for March 4, 2024.
