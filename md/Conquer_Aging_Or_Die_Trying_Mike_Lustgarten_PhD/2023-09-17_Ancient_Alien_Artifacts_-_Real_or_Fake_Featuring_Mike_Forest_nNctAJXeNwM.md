## Scientific Findings

### Dating and Material Analysis

*   **Adhesive Dating:**
    *   Carbon dating of adhesives used in artifacts, including resin in pipes and the primary source of red glue in mosaics, has yielded consistent results of 10,000 to 15,000 years BP.
    *   One mask's glue dated to 8,400 BP (approximately 10,000-11,000 years ago).
*   **Thermoluminescence Testing:**
    *   Thermoluminescence testing, used for ceramics, analyzes the last time a piece was fired.
    *   Some pieces were too old to be carbon-dated due to insufficient remaining carbon, suggesting ages potentially beyond the 50,000-year limit of the method.
*   **Adhesive Variations:**
    *   Adhesives from different geographical locations (e.g., Tula and Awalos) are distinct in type and composition, yet are primitive and contain chunks, not refined like modern glues.
*   **Luminescence and Phosphorescence:**
    *   Inlaid luminescent and phosphorescent materials are present in many artifacts, often unadvertised by sellers.
    *   These properties are observable in low light conditions.
*   **Gold Alloy Analysis:**
    *   XRF scanning of gold inlays reveals inconsistent purity (12-15 carat) and the presence of trace elements like silver, copper, and rhodium, suggesting unrefined or naturally occurring alloys not typical of modern refined gold.

### Craftsmanship and Engineering

*   **Precision Carving:**
    *   The ability to chisel stone with extreme precision in three dimensions is noted, with some pieces appearing flawless to the untrained eye.
*   **Mosaic Construction:**
    *   Stone skulls and other artifacts are constructed from numerous small, individually cut stones glued together, requiring significant skill and meticulous assembly.
*   **Stone Object Weight and Integrity:**
    *   Artifacts can be extremely heavy, such as a stone table base weighing over 420 pounds, made from pitted and fragile calcite, demonstrating significant structural integrity and engineering.
*   **Tooling Speculation:**
    *   The precision of engravings on some stones leads to speculation about the use of advanced tools, potentially including plasma cutters (invented in 1950), given that artifacts were submitted for testing decades before their invention.
*   **Stone Ball and Sphere Creation:**
    *   The creation of perfectly spherical stone balls, especially those made with mosaic techniques, is considered exceptionally difficult.
*   **Stone Lock Mechanism:**
    *   A stone pyramid artifact features a functional, primitive stone lock system operated by a pegged key.

### Biological and Genetic Depictions

*   **Alien and Hybrid Imagery:**
    *   Artifacts depict beings with almond-shaped eyes, sometimes with reptilian features on one side of the face.
    *   Depictions of DNA-like structures and beings within bubbles suggest a focus on genetics or creation.
*   **Skull Artifacts:**
    *   Bone skull artifacts, found in approximately a dozen examples, bear similarities to those found in the Rodeaux Mountains.
    *   Bone experts have examined these, noting similarities to cow skulls but concluding they are not cow skulls due to their unique structure, bone density, and fragility if modified from a cow skull.
*   **Depiction of "Creation" and "Pre-Flood" Stories:**
    *   Some imagery is interpreted as depicting the creation of humans, pre-flood narratives, or Atlantean influences.
*   **Human-like but Non-Standard Forms:**
    *   Some depicted beings are humanistic but not standard "gray" alien shapes, with variations in head shape.
*   **Duality and Transitory States:**
    *   The depiction of duality (e.g., human on one side, reptilian on the other) in eyes and features suggests representation of hybridity or transitional genetic states.

### Symbolic and Linguistic Content

*   **Writing and Symbols:**
    *   Numerous artifacts feature writing and symbols, with over 10,000 cataloged symbols exhibiting no apparent repetition or standard linguistic structures (e.g., vowels).
    *   Some writing resembles proto-cuneiform.
    *   Symbols akin to Masonic symbols have been found on artifacts predating known Masonic origins.
*   **Astrolabes and Sky Maps:**
    *   Sumerian-like artifacts function as astrolabes, depicting the night sky with sufficient detail to be dated using supercomputers, with some sky configurations matching dates thousands of years ago.
*   **Religious and Mythological Symbolism:**
    *   The "all-seeing eye" (pineal gland symbol), Ankh (symbol of life), and DNA are recurring motifs.
    *   Depictions of deities and symbols found in Egyptian and Sumerian cultures (e.g., Osiris, Thoth, Enki, Enlil) appear on artifacts, suggesting cross-cultural or ancient shared knowledge.
*   **Animalistic Depictions and Shapeshifting:**
    *   Many artifacts depict beings with animal heads and human bodies, or vice versa, interpreted as representations of shapeshifting or hybrid races, a theme common in ancient mythologies (Greek, Norse, Egyptian, Sumerian).

### Physical Properties and Anomalies

*   **Electromagnetic Field (EMF) Emissions:**
    *   Some artifacts emit EMF, with readings fluctuating and being highly localized to specific pieces.
    *   These emissions are distinct from the EMF of common electronic devices like smartphones.
    *   The EMF emissions are consistent and localized, even on pieces that do not exhibit luminescence.
*   **Green Banded Calcite:**
    *   Green banded calcite is used in artifacts. The natural coloring of calcite can be white, making the consistent use of green variants notable.
*   **Weight and Durability:**
    *   Heavy artifacts (e.g., 10-20 pound handbags, 400+ pound table bases) were created from materials that are often fragile, posing engineering challenges for their construction and preservation.
*   **Wear and Weathering:**
    *   The natural-looking wear and weathering on some artifacts are difficult to replicate. While artificial aging methods (e.g., rock tumblers) exist, they are considered destructive for intricate or large mosaic pieces.
*   **Drilled Holes and Illumination:**
    *   Some artifacts feature drilled holes, allowing light to pass through and illuminate gemstones or inlaid details, suggesting deliberate design for visual effect.
*   **Repair Evidence:**
    *   Evidence of ancient repairs using similar primitive adhesives on artifacts suggests they are not modern fakes.

### Historical and Governmental Context

*   **Government Disavowal:**
    *   The Mexican government officially considers these artifacts to be false or hoaxes.
    *   Museums, such as the INAA, reportedly possess many such pieces but lack a place for them in their historical narratives, suggesting a reluctance to integrate them into established history.
*   **Secrecy and Resistance to Research:**
    *   Universities and private labs are often unwilling to test or date these artifacts, citing ethical concerns or an unwillingness to engage with potentially controversial findings.
    *   This resistance suggests a potential effort to suppress information that could challenge established historical and scientific paradigms.

### Interpretations and Theories

*   **Ancient Advanced Civilization:**
    *   The sophistication of the artifacts suggests the presence of an advanced civilization predating known human history, potentially with technological capabilities beyond our current understanding.
*   **Intervention or Origin Theories:**
    *   The artifacts are interpreted as evidence of ancient alien visitation, intervention, or the existence of previous intelligent races that inhabited Earth.
*   **Genetic Engineering and Experimentation:**
    *   Depictions of DNA and hybrid beings suggest ancient involvement in genetic manipulation or the creation of new life forms.
*   **Communication and Record Keeping:**
    *   The complex symbols and detailed imagery may represent an ancient form of communication, record-keeping, or religious/mythological narratives.
*   **Multidimensional or Transdimensional Beings:**
    *   Some imagery is interpreted as depicting beings that can exist in multiple dimensions or states of being, consistent with some modern ufological theories.
*   **Historical Parallels:**
    *   The recurring themes and symbols across different cultures (Sumerian, Egyptian, Mesoamerican) suggest a common origin or a widespread ancient global civilization.
*   **DNA as Immortal Record:**
    *   A hypothesis suggests that advanced ancient civilizations might have encoded information within DNA itself as a form of immortal record.
