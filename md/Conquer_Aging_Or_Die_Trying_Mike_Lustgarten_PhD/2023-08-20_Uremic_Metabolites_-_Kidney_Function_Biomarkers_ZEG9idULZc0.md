# 2023-08-20 Uremic Metabolites - Kidney Function Biomarkers

## Executive Summary

*   Kidney function, as measured by estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), declines with age, dropping from approximately 125 in youth to around 55 in 95-year-olds.
*   Serum creatinine levels, a common eGFR component, increase with age but can be confounded by declining muscle mass, making it less reliable in older adults.
*   Cystatin C is a more robust marker of kidney function in advanced age, as it is less influenced by muscle mass changes. Higher cystatin C levels are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   Uremic metabolites, such as indoxyl sulfate, indoleacetic acid, paracresol sulfate, and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), accumulate in the blood with declining kidney function and increase significantly with age.
*   Uremic metabolite levels may offer a more sensitive indication of kidney function decline than creatinine alone, as they can increase even when creatinine levels remain stable or decrease.

## Kidney Function Decline with Age

*   Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), a biomarker of kidney function, shows a progressive decline with age.
    *   eGFR is approximately 125 in younger individuals.
    *   eGFR decreases to around 55 in 95-year-old individuals.

## Creatinine as a Kidney Function Biomarker

*   eGFR is often calculated using circulating creatinine levels. Reduced kidney function leads to increased blood creatinine.
*   **Age-Related Changes in Serum Creatinine:**
    *   Serum creatinine levels exhibit a slow but consistent and significant increase with age, as confirmed by a p-value below 0.05.
*   **Limitations of Creatinine:**
    *   Creatinine levels are proportional to muscle mass.
    *   Higher muscle mass correlates with higher circulating creatinine.
    *   Lower muscle mass correlates with lower circulating creatinine.
    *   Muscle mass declines with aging.
    *   While decreased kidney function would increase creatinine, declining muscle mass would decrease creatinine release into circulation. This can mask age-related changes in eGFR when using creatinine.

## Cystatin C as a Kidney Function Biomarker

*   Cystatin C is a more reliable marker of kidney function in advanced age as it is less sensitive to changes in muscle mass.
*   **Age-Related Changes in Cystatin C:**
    *   Circulating cystatin C levels increase with age.
    *   Relatively lower cystatin C levels indicate good kidney function.
    *   Relatively higher cystatin C levels indicate poor kidney function.
*   **Cystatin C and All-Cause Mortality Risk:**
    *   Higher cystatin C levels are associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality.
    *   **Survival Probability Analysis ( >15 years follow-up):**
        *   **Lowest cystatin C levels (< 0.7 mg/L):** Nearly all individuals survived, with approximately 5% mortality.
        *   **Age-related cystatin C levels (> 1.08 mg/L):** Approximately half of the individuals died within the 15-year follow-up period.
    *   Conclusion: Lower cystatin C levels are associated with better survival outcomes.

## Uremic Metabolites and Kidney Function

*   Uremic metabolites are substances that accumulate in the blood in the presence of poor kidney function.
*   **Formation of Uremic Metabolites:**
    *   Dietary intake of amino acids (e.g., tryptophan, tyrosine) and choline.
    *   Metabolism by gut microbiota produces indoles, phenols, and trimethylamine (TMA).
    *   Further metabolism (by gut bacteria or liver) converts these into:
        *   Indoles -> Indoxyl sulfate, Indoleacetic acid (IAA)
        *   Phenols -> Paracresol sulfate
        *   TMA -> Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)
    *   Indoxyl sulfate, indoleacetic acid, paracresol sulfate, and TMAO are examples of uremic metabolites.
*   **Age-Related Increase in Uremic Metabolites:**
    *   Levels of these four uremic metabolites are significantly higher in older individuals (97-year-olds) compared to younger individuals (67-year-olds), with differences often approaching or exceeding twofold.
    *   These increases are statistically significant (p < 0.05, FDR < 0.05).
*   **Additional Uremic Metabolites:**
    *   Other uremic metabolites that also increase with age include:
        *   Dimethylarginine (ADMA/SDMA)
        *   1-methylhistidine
        *   3-methylhistidine
        *   Trigonelline
        *   Trans-4-hydroxyproline
        *   Aconitate
        *   Kynurenine
    *   These seven additional metabolites also show significantly higher levels in older individuals compared to younger individuals.
*   **Personal Metabolomic Data:**
    *   An individual's uremic metabolite sum increased from ~41 µM to ~62.5 µM between two tests, indicating a worsening trend.
    *   Paracresol sulfate was a major contributor to this increase, more than doubling between tests.
    *   **Creatinine vs. Uremic Metabolites:**
        *   While creatinine levels remained stable or slightly decreased between tests, the overall uremic metabolite sum increased by almost 50%.
        *   This suggests that uremic metabolites may provide a more sensitive indication of kidney function decline than creatinine alone, even when eGFR (derived from creatinine) shows no change.
    *   **Goal:** To avoid age-related increases in uremic metabolites and aim to reduce the current elevated levels.
