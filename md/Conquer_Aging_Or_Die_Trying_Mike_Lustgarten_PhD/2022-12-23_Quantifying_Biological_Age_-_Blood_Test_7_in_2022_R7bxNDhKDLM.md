# 2022-12-23 Quantifying Biological Age - Blood Test 7 in 2022

## Executive Summary
*   The author's most recent phenotypic age (Levine calculator) is 32.6 years, which is 17.3 years younger than their chronological age.
*   In 2022, the author achieved a statistically significant reduction in Phenotypic Age scores compared to the average scores from 2020 and 2021.
*   The average reduction in biological age relative to chronological age (CA - BA) increased substantially in 2022 (15.5 years) compared to prior tests (11.9 years average).
*   The aging.ai predicted age for the latest test is 28 years, approximately 21.9 years younger than chronological age.
*   Recent blood work highlighted elevated Homocysteine (10 $\mu$mol/L) and lower than ideal DHEA Sulfate (109 $\mu$g/dL), both associated with increased all-cause mortality risk as they increase/decrease with age, respectively.

## Phenotypic Age (Levine) Analysis

The biological age calculation is based on nine component biomarkers plus chronological age, utilizing Dr. Morgan Levine's phenotypic age calculator.

**Current Biological Age (December 2022):**
*   Phenotypic Age: 32.6 years
*   Reduction from Chronological Age: 17.3 years
*   Note: High-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) was measured below 0.3 mg/L, suggesting the actual biological age could be slightly lower.

**Historical Phenotypic Age Trends (Average per Year):**
| Year | Number of Tests | Average Phenotypic Age |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2018–2019 | 3 | 36.1 years |
| 2020 | 6 | 35.6 years |
| 2021 | N/A (Implied in comparison) | 35.6 years |
| 2022 | 7 | 33.8 years |

**Statistical Comparison:**
*   A two-sample t-test demonstrated that the biological age scores for the seven tests conducted in 2022 were **significantly lower** when compared against the twelve tests from 2020 and 2021.

**Chronological Age (CA) vs. Biological Age (BA) Reduction:**
*   **Prior to 2022 (15 tests):** Average reduction (CA - BA) was 11.9 years.
*   **In 2022 (7 tests):** Every test showed a greater reduction than the prior average. The average reduction achieved was 15.5 years.

## aging.ai Biological Age Analysis

The aging.ai calculation utilizes 19 component biomarkers (version 3.0, based on the North American dataset).

**Current aging.ai Biological Age (December 2022):**
*   Predicted Age: 28 years
*   Reduction from Chronological Age: 21.9 years

**Historical aging.ai Age Trends:**
*   **2009–2014 (3 tests over 5 years):** Average age was 32 years.
*   **2016–2021 (27 tests):** Average age was 29.9 years.
*   **2022 (7 tests):** Average age was 29.4 years.

**Statistical Consistency:**
*   A two-sample t-test comparing data from 2016–2021 versus 2022 showed **no statistically significant difference**, indicating the average yearly aging.ai age has remained consistently in the 29 to 30-year range over the last seven years, irrespective of chronological progression.

## Highlighted Biomarker Data

The following biomarkers warrant specific attention as they are trending in a direction associated with increased aging risk:

**1. Homocysteine**
*   Current Value: 10 $\mu$mol/L (Relatively high values are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk and increase during aging).
*   Intervention: Glycine supplementation was initiated on December 15th, 2022, with the goal of reducing this value toward the $7.5 \mu$mol/L range.

**2. DHEA Sulfate**
*   Current Value: 109 $\mu$g/dL (Relatively low levels are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk and levels decline during aging).
*   Intervention Context: Fructose intake was reduced for this specific test cycle, and the relationship between fructose intake and DHEA Sulfate levels will be detailed in a future video.
