# 2022-06-26 A Bile Acid TBMCA Is Involved In A Mechanism That Reduces Muscle Mass And Strength

## Executive Summary

*   Antibiotic treatment in young mice significantly reduces gut bacterial DNA content, leading to decreased muscle mass and strength.
*   Antibiotics alter bile acid composition, dramatically increasing cecal levels of tauro-beta-muricholic acid (TBMCA).
*   TBMCA acts as an inactivator of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the intestine, leading to reduced release of Fibroblast Growth Factor 15/19 (FGF15/19) into the blood.
*   Reduced FGF15/19 signaling is a key mechanism for the observed decrease in muscle mass and strength in antibiotic-treated mice.
*   Exogenous FGF19 treatment can reverse the antibiotic-induced muscle loss and weakness in young mice and significantly increase muscle mass and strength in aged mice.

## Impact of Antibiotics on Muscle Mass and Strength

Antibiotic treatment in young mice reduces gut bacterial content. A four-week study showed that after one week of antibiotic treatment, gut bacterial DNA content was reduced by 80% and remained at this reduced level for the duration of the study.

This reduction in gut bacteria has a direct impact on muscle:
*   **Muscle Mass:** The weight of three lower leg muscles – the quadriceps (upper thigh), gastrocnemius (behind the shin), and tibialis anterior (front of the shin) – was reduced in antibiotic-treated mice compared to untreated mice.
*   **Muscle Strength:** Antibiotic-treated mice also showed reduced muscle strength, as indicated by grip strength, compared to non-antibiotic-treated mice.

Therefore, antibiotic treatment in young mice reduces both muscle mass and strength.

## Gut Bacteria and Bile Acid Function

To investigate how gut bacteria impact muscle mass and strength, researchers examined gut bacterial functions. Bacterial gene counts for primary and secondary bile acids were lower in antibiotic-treated mice compared to untreated mice, indicating reduced bile acid-related bacterial functions.

To determine if these functional differences translated to metabolite levels, total bile acid levels were measured in the cecum (the beginning of the large intestine). Antibiotic-treated mice showed a dramatic reduction in cecal bile acid levels, decreasing from approximately 350 micrograms per gram to less than 50 micrograms per gram.

Antibiotics also alter specific bile acid composition:
*   **Untreated Mice:** Major bile acids were deoxycholic acid (DCA) and omega-muricholic acid.
*   **Antibiotic-Treated Mice:** Major bile acids were tauro-cholic acid (TCA) and tauro-beta-muricholic acid (TBMCA).

It is important to note that while the *composition* changed, overall bile acid levels in the cecum were drastically reduced in antibiotic-treated mice.

## Role of Tauro-beta-muricholic Acid (TBMCA)

Despite the overall reduction in bile acids, cecal levels of tauro-beta-muricholic acid (TBMCA) were significantly higher – almost 20-fold higher – in antibiotic-treated mice compared to untreated mice. This led to the hypothesis that TBMCA could negatively impact muscle mass and/or strength.

TBMCA is indeed involved in a mechanism that reduces muscle mass. The overall mechanism linking reduced gut bacterial DNA content (from antibiotics) to reduced muscle mass and strength involves TBMCA.

Increased cecal TBMCA levels are significant because TBMCA is an inactivator of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the intestine. Data shows that as TBMCA concentration increases, FXR activation decreases.

## The TBMCA-FXR-FGF15/19 Pathway

When intestinal FXR is active, Fibroblast Growth Factor 15 (FGF15, or FGF19 in humans) is released into the blood. However, higher levels of TBMCA inactivate FXR, leading to reduced release of FGF15/19. Plasma levels of FGF15 were significantly reduced in antibiotic-treated mice, supporting this pathway.

**Mechanism for Reduced Muscle Mass and Strength:**

Antibiotic Treatment
-> Reduced Gut Bacterial DNA Content
-> Altered Bile Acid Composition & Increased Cecal Tauro-beta-muricholic Acid (TBMCA)
-> Inactivation of Intestinal Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR)
-> Reduced Fibroblast Growth Factor 15/19 (FGF15/19) Release into Blood
-> Decreased Muscle Mass and Strength

## FGF19 as a Potential Therapeutic

FGF19 increases muscle mass and strength in young mice. A study with three groups of mice evaluated the effect of FGF19:

*   **VP:** Untreated mice (control).
*   **AP:** Antibiotic-treated mice, showing significantly reduced muscle mass.
*   **AF:** Antibiotic-treated mice subcutaneously injected with FGF19 (human version).

Mice in the AF group (antibiotic-treated, FGF19-injected) showed significant increases in muscle mass for the quadriceps, gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior muscles, reversing the antibiotic-induced reduction. While antibiotics reduced grip strength in the AP group, FGF19 injection in the AF group resulted in a small but significant increase in muscle strength in antibiotic-treated mice. This confirms that FGF19 increases muscle mass and strength in young mice.

FGF19 also increases muscle mass and strength in aged mice. A separate study examined muscle mass and grip strength in aged mice, comparing three groups:

*   Six-month-old mice (young controls).
*   25-month-old mice (aged controls), which showed reduced muscle mass (soleus and tibialis anterior) compared to young mice.
*   25-month-old mice treated with FGF19.

Aged mice treated with FGF19 showed significantly increased muscle mass for both the soleus (a long muscle located on the back of the shin, under the gastrocnemius) and tibialis anterior muscles. Aged mice generally exhibited about half the grip strength of young mice. However, aged mice treated with FGF19 showed significantly increased grip strength.

Currently, there are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating whether FGF19 treatment can improve muscle mass and strength in older adults.

## Conclusion and Future Questions

The mechanism identified for decreased muscle mass and strength, at least in antibiotic-treated mice, involves the bile acid tauro-beta-muricholic acid (TBMCA) reducing FXR activation, which in turn reduces FGF15/19 levels.

This raises further questions:
*   Can other bile acids increase FGF19 signaling to enhance muscle mass and strength?
*   Are there other pathways through which bile acids can impact muscle anabolism?
