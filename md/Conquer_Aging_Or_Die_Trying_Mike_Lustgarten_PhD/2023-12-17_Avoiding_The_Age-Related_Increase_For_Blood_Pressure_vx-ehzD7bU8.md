# 2023-12-17 Avoiding The Age-Related Increase For Blood Pressure

## Executive Summary
*   Systolic blood pressure (SBP) consistently increases with age across the adult lifespan (18-95 years) for both men and women, based on a large epidemiological study.
*   Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) typically increases until approximately 50-60 years of age, after which it tends to decrease. To differentiate a low DBP indicative of youth from that of older age, SBP levels must be considered (low DBP with low SBP suggests youth; low DBP with high SBP suggests older age).
*   An optimal blood pressure range for young adults is suggested to be 100/60 mmHg, with average youthful values around 118/67 mmHg for men and 108/65 mmHg for women.
*   Personal data tracked over 14 months demonstrated a reduction in average SBP from 123 mmHg to 117 mmHg and DBP from 73 mmHg to 69 mmHg, moving towards more youthful levels.
*   A significant positive correlation was observed between body weight and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. A lower body weight was associated with lower blood pressure and also correlated with improvements in other age-related biomarkers such as resting heart rate, heart rate variability, and slow-wave sleep.

## Age-Related Blood Pressure Changes

A study involving approximately 386,000 people demonstrated clear trends in blood pressure changes with aging:
*   **Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP):** Increases consistently from 18 to 95 years of age for both men and women.
*   **Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP):** Increases until about 50-60 years of age, followed by a decrease over the subsequent 40 years.

When interpreting a low diastolic blood pressure, it's crucial to consider the systolic blood pressure:
*   **Older Age:** Low DBP in conjunction with high SBP.
*   **Younger Age:** Low DBP in conjunction with low SBP.

## Optimal Blood Pressure Ranges

Based on epidemiological data, age-expected blood pressure for a 51-year-old would be approximately 125/77 mmHg. However, average youthful blood pressure values are considerably lower:
*   **Men:** 118/67 mmHg
*   **Women:** 108/65 mmHg

Smaller studies indicate an even lower optimal blood pressure, with some reporting an average of 100/60 mmHg for 20-year-olds. Therefore, an optimal blood pressure range is proposed to be:
*   **Men:** 100/60 to 118/67 mmHg
*   **Women:** 100/60 to 108/65 mmHg

## Personal Blood Pressure Data and Measurement Protocol

Over 170 measurements spanning 14 months (September 2022 to December 2023), personal blood pressure data was collected using a standard automated blood pressure cuff. The measurement protocol was standardized to minimize variability:

*   **Timing:** All measurements were taken between 11:30 AM and 1:00 PM, with most occurring between 11:30 AM and 12:00 PM.
*   **Averaging:** The average of 5-6 tests was recorded over a 15-20 minute period for each measurement session.
*   **Fasting State:** Each measurement was taken exactly 4-5 hours after eating or drinking, ensuring a post-absorptive state.

### Observed Trends:
*   **Systolic Blood Pressure:** In September 2022, average SBP was approximately 123 mmHg, close to the age-expected value. Over 14 months, this was reduced to an average of 117 mmHg in November 2023 (based on 14 tests).
*   **Diastolic Blood Pressure:** Similarly, DBP started at approximately 73 mmHg in September 2022 and was reduced to an average of 69 mmHg in November 2023 (based on 14 tests).

These data indicate a consistent reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure over the 14-month period.

## Body Weight Correlation with Blood Pressure

Body weight data, collected daily in a fasted state and corresponding to the blood pressure measurement days, revealed a significant relationship with blood pressure.

*   **Initial Status:** In September 2022, body weight was 151 pounds with a body fat percentage of 12.9% (measured December 2022). Blood pressure was close to age-expected levels at this time.
*   **Weight Reduction:** Over 14 months, body weight was reduced to an average of 141 pounds, representing approximately a 10-pound weight loss.

Analysis of the 170 paired measurements showed significant positive correlations between body weight and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure:
*   Higher body weight was significantly correlated with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
*   Lower body weight was significantly correlated with lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

In this case, a lower body weight was significantly correlated with more youthful blood pressure values. This trend of lower body weight and increased leanness has also been correlated with other improved aging biomarkers, including:
*   Improved resting heart rate and heart rate variability.
*   Increased percentage of slow-wave sleep.
