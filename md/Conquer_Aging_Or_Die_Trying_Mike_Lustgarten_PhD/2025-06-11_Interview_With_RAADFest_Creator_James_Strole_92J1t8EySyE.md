# 2025-06-11 Interview With RAADFest Creator James Strole

## Executive Summary

*   The concept of aging as a disease is a critical step towards securing funding and advancing research for longevity interventions.
*   Personalized health approaches, utilizing commercial labs and AI, offer a faster and more direct path to optimizing individual health than solely relying on government funding and traditional clinical trials.
*   Longevity exercise focuses on maintaining body function and bone density without overtaxing the system, contrasting with traditional high-impact training.
*   Mindset, particularly embracing a spirit of unlimited lifespan and reducing anxiety, plays a crucial role in overall health and resilience, alongside physiological interventions.
*   The exploration of internal human potential for vitality and creativity is a key aspect of longevity, independent of external chemical stimuli.

## Origins of Longevity Interest

James Strole's lifelong interest in longevity began at age 11 following the death of his grandmother. He questioned the idea of an afterlife and wondered why a "heaven on earth" couldn't be achieved during one's lifetime. This early curiosity was nurtured by teachers and, in 1968, by meeting Bernie and Charles Paul Brown, who espoused the possibility of immortality. Strole began working with them, eventually traveling globally and co-founding the "People Forever" movement. Differences in ideology led to the separation and the formation of People Unlimited in 1995, a community focused on longevity. In 2014, he reached out to Bill Falloon, leading to the development of the Coalition for Radical Life Extension and RAADFest.

## Evolution of RAADFest and Future Vision

RAADFest evolved from a long-held desire for a major event to galvanize the longevity community. The future vision includes:

*   **2026 Longevity Rights Rally:** A walk and rally in Washington D.C., aiming to get the FDA to recognize aging as a disease and advocate for best-choice medicine.
*   **Global Strategy and Roadshow:** A comprehensive plan for the Coalition for Radical Life Extension, including a "RadFest on the Road" initiative to bring one-day events across the country and eventually the world, aiming to introduce longevity concepts to a broader audience.
*   **Defining Aging as a Disease:** A key objective of the rally is to formally classify aging as a disease, which is seen as crucial for increasing support and financial backing for longevity research and treatments.
*   **Decentralized Optimal Health:** A belief that leveraging commercial labs and AI for personalized health data and strategies is more effective than solely relying on slow-moving government initiatives and clinical trials.

## The "Gospel of Longevity" and Media Strategy

Strole is writing a book titled "The Gospel of Longevity." He advocates for saturating social media platforms (TikTok, Instagram, X, Blue Sky, etc.) with content to spread the message of longevity more effectively and rapidly educate the public.

## Personal Health and Longevity Approach

At 76 years old (turning 77), James Strole exemplifies vibrant health and an active lifestyle, attributing this to a combination of mindset and lifestyle choices.

### Mindset and Philosophy

*   **Spirit of Immortality:** Strole emphasizes an internal "spirit of immortality" and a proactive mindset that transcends the limitations of age. He believes in living fully in the present and not waiting for an afterlife.
*   **"Heaven on Earth":** Echoing his childhood query, he believes in creating a fulfilling life and positive environment now, rather than deferring it to a future state.
*   **Resilience and Strength:** He highlights the need for inner strength and resilience to navigate the challenges of life and the pursuit of longevity, drawing parallels to overcoming adversity.
*   **Beyond Survival:** Strole distinguishes between living in a state of survival and embracing a life of creativity and exploration, facilitated by shedding the "tyranny of death."

### Diet and Lifestyle

*   **Paleo Diet (Dr. Michael Rose's Concept):** Strole follows a personalized paleo diet, finding it beneficial for energy levels and weight management.
*   **Longevity Exercise:** His exercise approach focuses on sustained movement and maintaining physical function rather than high-impact, strenuous workouts. This includes:
    *   Daily trampoline jumping and stretching.
    *   Extensive body movement throughout the day, incorporating standing and stretching while working.
    *   Rotation of at least 12-15 different exercises daily, including practices like infrared sauna and vibrator plate use.
    *   Emphasis on pushing oneself to an edge without overtaxing the body, promoting strength and bone density.
*   **Sun Exposure:** Short, controlled periods of sunbathing (5-15 minutes) are practiced to condition the skin without burning.
*   **Natural Skin Care:** Use of natural soaps and occasional application of oils like coconut oil and olive oil.
*   **No Sunscreen:** Avoids sunscreen during short sun exposure periods.

### Supplements and Interventions

Strole takes a varied regimen of supplements, rotating them based on blood work and specific goals, typically around 30 per day. Examples include:

*   **C15:** Taken for its potential to mimic pro-longevity pathways.
*   **Basic Vitamins:** Vitamin B, D, E, Vitamin C (granular form).
*   **Astaxanthin, Curcumin, Turmeric:** Used for their anti-inflammatory properties.
*   **Omegas, Carnosine:** Included in his rotation.
*   **Synoptic Activator (Life Extension):** Used weekly to potentially remove senescent cells.
*   **Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN):** Taken for five years to reduce inflammation and potentially aid cancer prevention, noticing improved joint fluidity.
*   **Thyroid Medication:** He takes thyroid medication.
*   **Stem Cell Treatments:** Has undergone placenta stem cell and exosome treatments, reporting positive results for joint health and bone density.
*   **OsteoStrong Program:** Participates in a franchise program utilizing computerized exercises to build bone density and strengthen tendons.

### Biomarker Monitoring

Strole blood tests a minimum of three times a year, closely monitoring various biomarkers, including cardiovascular indicators, inflammation markers (like CRP, though a specific recent value was not recalled but acknowledged as potentially high if 4.7), and others. He emphasizes the importance of tracking historical data and rate of change, not just reference ranges.

## Underrated Aspects of Longevity Research

Strole identifies two key areas as underrated:

1.  **Movement and Longevity Exercise:** Many individuals misunderstand exercise for longevity, either overdoing it or not understanding the principles of maintaining the body without undue stress. Education on "longevity exercise" is crucial.
2.  **Mindset and Internal State:** While biomarkers and supplements are important, the impact of mindset, anxiety levels, and the ability to relax and find peace are often overlooked. Embracing unlimited lifespan potential internally is as vital as external interventions.

## Philosophical Exploration

*   **Beyond Physical Existence:** The conversation touches on whether there is more to reality beyond our physical senses and if consciousness persists after death, referencing psychedelic experiences as a potential avenue for perceiving broader realities. Strole leans towards the idea that true exploration begins within oneself, rather than seeking external stimuli.
*   **Cryopreservation:** Strole expresses reservations about cryopreservation, primarily due to the uncertain long-term commitment required from future generations to maintain funding. He prefers to focus on living fully now.
*   **If Aging Were Conquered:** If death were no longer an involuntary reality, Strole envisions a world of rejoicing, boundless creativity, deeper exploration of relationships, and expanded pursuits like space travel, all free from the "tyranny of death."

## Personal Health Philosophy

Strole emphasizes that health is a lifestyle and that the "squeeze the orange" approach – extracting every drop of life from one's potential – is paramount. He believes in pushing personal boundaries without self-destruction, drawing a parallel to "dancing through life" rather than "pounding through life." He avoids situations that could lead to injury, recognizing the detrimental impact on a longevity journey.

## Future Aspirations if Aging is Conquered

Strole envisions a future of rejoicing, unburdened by the fear of death. He anticipates a surge in creativity, allowing for deeper exploration of relationships, intimacy, communication, and pursuits like space exploration, creating a "heaven on earth."
