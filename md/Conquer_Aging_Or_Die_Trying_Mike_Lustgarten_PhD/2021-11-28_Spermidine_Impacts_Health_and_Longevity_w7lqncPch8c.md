# 2021-11-28 Spermidine Impacts Health and Longevity

## Executive Summary
*   Spermidine supplementation extends median lifespan in mice, even when initiated later in life.
*   Higher dietary spermidine intake in humans is associated with reduced all-cause mortality.
*   Increased dietary spermidine is linked to a significantly reduced risk of future cognitive impairment in humans.
*   Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggest spermidine supplementation can improve memory performance and overall cognitive function in older adults.
*   Spermidine does not appear to extend lifespan in rats.

## Mouse Data

### Polyamines and Lifespan Extension in Mice
A 2009 study investigated the impact of dietary polyamine levels on the lifespan of male JC1 ICR mice. Mice were fed low, normal, or high levels of polyamines.

*   **Dietary Composition:**
    *   No significant differences in macronutrients (protein, fat, fiber, calories) were observed between the low, normal, and high polyamine diets.
    *   Polyamines are molecules containing multiple amino groups (NH2). Key polyamines include putrescine (2 amino groups), spermidine (3 amino groups), and spermine (4 amino groups).
*   **Polyamines Levels in Diets (High vs. Normal):**
    *   Putrescine: 1.7-fold higher.
    *   Spermine: 2.3-fold higher.
    *   Spermidine: 3.5-fold higher. Spermidine also had the highest absolute content across all diets.
*   **Blood Levels:**
    *   **Spermine:** No significant differences were observed between the normal and high polyamine diet groups at 8, 16, or 26 weeks. While there was a trend towards doubling at 26 weeks, it was not statistically significant (p=0.09). High variability was noted in the high polyamine group.
    *   **Spermidine:** No differences were seen at 8 or 16 weeks. However, at 26 weeks, the high polyamine diet group showed approximately a 50% increase in blood spermidine levels compared to the normal polyamine diet group.
    *   **Putrescine:** Blood levels were not measured.
*   **Lifespan Impact:**
    *   The high polyamine diet significantly extended the median lifespan compared to the normal polyamine diet. This suggests spermidine may be a key contributor due to its higher concentration and increased blood levels.

### Spermidine Supplementation Studies in Mice

*   **Early Intervention (4 months of age):**
    *   Female C57BL/6J mice were fed spermidine in their drinking water starting at 4 months of age (equivalent to adolescence in humans).
    *   This intervention significantly increased median lifespan compared to control mice.
*   **Later Intervention (18 months of age):**
    *   Male and female C57BL/6J mice were fed spermidine in their drinking water starting at 18 months of age (equivalent to middle age).
    *   This later-life intervention also resulted in an increased median lifespan.
*   **Lifelong Supplementation (from birth):**
    *   A study using a higher concentration (3 millimolar) of spermidine in the drinking water supplemented mice from birth for their entire lifespan.
    *   This led to a significant extension of median survival compared to controls. Maximum lifespan was not evaluated.

### Spermidine in Rats
*   Studies supplementing rats with spermidine in their drinking water starting at 18 months of age showed no increase in median lifespan, despite achieving a doubling of blood spermidine levels, indicating ingestion.

## Human Evidence

### Association with All-Cause Mortality
A study of 829 individuals (average age 67) assessed dietary spermidine intake and followed them for 20 years to evaluate all-cause mortality.

*   **Spermidine Intake Categories (mg/day):**
    *   **Low:** < 9.1 mg/day
    *   **Medium:** 9.1 - 11.6 mg/day
    *   **High:** > 11.6 mg/day
*   **Findings:**
    *   The lowest all-cause mortality was observed in the group with the highest spermidine intake (> 11.6 mg/day).
    *   Significantly higher mortality was seen in the medium intake group (9.1 - 11.6 mg/day).
    *   The highest all-cause mortality was associated with the lowest spermidine intake (< 9.1 mg/day).

### Association with Cognitive Function
Data from the same study also assessed future risk for cognitive impairment in relation to spermidine intake.

*   **Findings:**
    *   Individuals with high spermidine intake (> 11.6 mg/day) had approximately a 70% reduced risk for future cognitive impairment compared to those with low intake (< 9.1 mg/day).

### Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) on Cognitive Function

*   **RCT 1: Older adults at risk for dementia**
    *   **Participants:** 28 individuals, average age 70.
    *   **Duration:** 3 months.
    *   **Intervention:** 1.2 mg/day spermidine supplement vs. placebo.
    *   **Outcome:** Reported a positive impact on memory performance, despite no significant differences in blood spermidine or other polyamine levels between groups.
*   **RCT 2: Older adults with dementia**
    *   **Participants:** 92 individuals, average age 83.
    *   **Duration:** 3 months.
    *   **Intervention:** Bread rolls enriched with wheat germ (a spermidine-rich source) vs. control bread rolls.
    *   **Outcomes:**
        *   The intervention group consumed an average of 1 mg/day more spermidine.
        *   Blood spermidine levels increased by approximately 40% in the intervention group (from 42 to 58 ng/mL).
        *   The intervention group showed an improvement in cognitive performance, while the control group showed consistent or declining performance.

## Food Sources of Spermidine (mg spermidine per 100g)

*   **Wheat Germ:** Highly concentrated source. Approximately 30 grams per day can reach the >12 mg/day threshold associated with reduced mortality.
*   **Natto:** Fermented soybean product.
*   **Green Bell Peppers**
*   **Mushrooms:** A significant source for personal intake.
*   **Chicken Liver**
*   **Grilled Chicken**
