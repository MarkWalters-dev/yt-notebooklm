# 2023-02-19 Blood Test 1 in 2023 - Diet Composition

### Executive Summary
*   Biological age remained significantly lower than chronological age (PhenoAge 33 years, Aging.ai 28 years), consistent with previous data.
*   The addition of Glycine (2g/day) and the probiotic *Streptococcus salivarius* did not demonstrably impact biological age metrics for this test.
*   Average daily calorie intake was the lowest recorded since 2015 (2194 kcal/day), driven by a strategy to achieve leanness.
*   Recalculated macronutrient composition (accounting for fiber's caloric contribution) was 42% fat, 40% net carbohydrates, and 18% protein.
*   Total fructose intake reached a purposeful low of 57.5 g/day, and specific micronutrient targets (e.g., Niacin, Vitamin K, Beta-carotene, Vitamin E) were managed based on personal biomarker correlations.

## Biological Age Metrics
For the first blood test in 2023, biological age using the PhenoAge calculator was 33 years, which is 17 years younger than chronological age. Using Aging.ai, biological age was 28 years, 22 years younger than chronological age. These results were within the range of previous lowest biological age data from 2022.

## Supplements
The following supplements were taken during the 42-day period corresponding to this blood test:

*   **Levothyroxine:** Taken daily since a hypothyroidism diagnosis in the twenties.
*   **Vitamin D:** 1000 IU per day, supplemented for approximately eight months out of the year.
*   **Glycine:** 2 grams per day for 39 of the 42 days.
*   **Streptococcus salivarius (probiotic):** Supplemented for 13 of the 42 days, with the goal of optimizing the oral microbiome.

**Finding:** The addition of Glycine and/or *Streptococcus salivarius* did not lead to a dramatic improvement or worsening of biological age data for this test, with metrics remaining consistent with previous ranges.

## Diet Composition
The dietary period corresponding to this blood test was from December 12, 2022, through January 22, 2023, spanning 42 days. This period began immediately after Blood Test #7 of 2022 and concluded the day before Blood Test #1 of 2023.

### Food Intake by Grams
A total of 47 different foods were consumed, with vanilla beans being the lowest intake. Glycine intake averaged 1.9 grams per day due to supplementation, with an initial intention to lower homocysteine, which was not achieved.

### Cheat Days
During the 42-day period, there were two "cheat days," a self-imposed limit to prevent increased cravings for less nutritious foods.
*   **First Cheat Day:** A chocolate bar topped with peanut butter and grape jelly.
*   **Second Cheat Day:** Three slices of Brooklyn pizza. Pizza contributed an average of 24 calories per day over the 42 days, ranking it #20 in terms of calorie contribution.

### Top 10 Foods by Average Daily Calorie Intake
The top 10 foods contributing to average daily calorie intake over the 42-day period were:
1.  **Sardines:** Averaging 233 calories per day.
2.  **Nuts and Seeds (e.g., Almonds):** Included for Vitamin E, with a target of 20 milligrams or more per day.
3.  **Coconut Butter:** Included because saturated fat is positively correlated with HDL in personal data, and HDL tends to be lower (around 45 mg/dL).
4.  **Flaxseeds:** Included for omega-3 fatty acids, which are significantly correlated with lower creatinine (an index of kidney function) in personal data.
5.  **Walnuts:** Included for omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids.
6.  **Strawberries:** Also ranked as the number one food in terms of intake by grams.
7.  **Barley**
8.  **Whole Steel-Cut Oats**
9.  **Beets**

## Macronutrients
Average daily calorie intake was 2194 kcal/day, the lowest recorded since April 2015 (previous low was 2235 kcal/day from the last test in 2022). The individual intends to go lower only after hitting a body weight plateau.

*   **Protein:** 97 grams per day (18% of total calories).
*   **Total Fat:** 82.5 grams per day (34% of total calories).
    *   This includes monounsaturated, polyunsaturated (omega-3 and omega-6), saturated, trans fatty acids, and cholesterol.
*   **Carbohydrates:**
    *   Total Carbs: 304 grams per day.
    *   Fiber: 86 grams per day.
    *   Net Carbs: 220 grams per day (40% of total calories, calculated as (net carbs * 4 cal/g) / average daily calorie intake * 100).

### Chronometer Carb Calculation Adjustment
Chronometer counts fiber as 2.2 calories per gram. Since fiber is fermented by gut bacteria into short-chain fatty acids, the caloric contribution from fiber fermentation was added to total fat for a more accurate net macronutrient breakdown.

**Fiber Fermentation Process:**
Dietary Fiber -> Gut Bacteria Fermentation -> Short-Chain Fatty Acids (Acetate, Propionate, Butyrate)

*   Calories from fiber: 2.2 cal/g * 86 g = 189 calories. These calories were added to the fat intake for the net macro calculation.

### Net Macronutrient Breakdown
After accounting for fiber's caloric contribution to fat:
*   **Total Fat:** 42% of calories.
*   **Net Carbs:** 40% of calories.
*   **Protein:** 18% of calories.

### Sugars
Total fructose intake (including fructose from sucrose) averaged 57.5 grams per day. This represents the lowest purposeful fructose intake since diet tracking began in 2015 (previous low was 59 grams).

## Micronutrients
Micronutrient intake was managed with purposeful vitamin and mineral targets.

*   **Niacin (B3) and Vitamin K:** Aimed for relatively higher intakes due to positive correlative scores with big-picture blood biomarkers in personal data.
*   **Beta-carotene and Vitamin E:** Aimed for intakes below the highest personal intake due to net negative correlative scores with blood biomarkers in personal data.
    *   **Beta-carotene:** Approximately 50,000 micrograms (50 milligrams) per day, which is still a significant intake but not the highest achieved.
    *   **Vitamin E:** Intake was above the RDA of 15 milligrams per day, but not the highest, as higher intakes in personal data correlated with more blood biomarkers trending negatively.
*   **Minerals:** Detailed mineral intake data was recorded.
