# 2023-07-16 Quantifying Biological Age - Blood Test 4 In 2023

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age, calculated using Dr. Morgan Levine's Phenotypic Age, was 34.5 years (16 years younger than chronological age) and has shown a statistically significant reduction from 2020-2021 to 2022-2023.
*   Biological age, calculated using Aging.ai, was 31 years (19 years younger than chronological age) and has remained stable at an average of 29.8 years for the past eight years (2016-2023).
*   Research suggests an optimal White Blood Cell (WBC) count for life expectancy is 3.5-6 x 10^3 cells/µL, a narrower range than typical lab reference values.
*   An optimal neutrophil count for minimizing all-cause mortality risk is indicated to be 2-3 x 10^3 cells/µL, also narrower than standard lab reference ranges.
*   Despite some single blood test results being at the border of lab reference ranges, the speaker's long-term average WBC (4.6 x 10^3 cells/µL) and neutrophil counts (2299 cells/µL) fall within these identified optimal ranges for longevity and health.

## Phenotypic Age (Levine's Test)

*   **Current Biological Age:** 34.5 years, approximately 16 years younger than chronological age, based on Dr. Morgan Levine's phenotypic age calculator.
*   **Note on hsCRP:** For the eleventh consecutive test, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was less than 0.3 mg/L (Quest's limit of detection). A lower hsCRP could theoretically further reduce biological age.
*   **Historical Trend (2018-2023):**
    *   **2018-2019 (3 tests):** Average biological age of 36.1 years.
    *   **2020-2021 (12 tests):** Average biological age of 35.6 years in both years.
    *   **2022 (7 tests):** Average biological age of 33.8 years, a significant reduction.
    *   **2023 (first 4 tests):** Average biological age of 33.6 years, on par or slightly below 2022.
*   **Significant Reduction:** A two-sample t-test comparing the 12 tests from 2020-2021 with the 11 tests from 2022-2023 showed a statistically significant reduction in biological age (p < 0.05).

## Aging.ai Age

*   **Current Biological Age:** 31 years, approximately 19 years younger than chronological age, using the free Aging.ai tool (19 biomarkers, North American dataset).
*   **Historical Trend (2009-2023):**
    *   **2009-02/2013 (3 tests):** Average biological age of 32 years.
    *   **2016-2022 (34 tests):** Average biological age of 29.8 years.
    *   **2023 (first 4 tests):** Average biological age of 29.8 years.
*   **Stability:** The average Aging.ai age has been stable for the past eight years (2016-2023).

## Blood Test Analysis

### White Blood Cell (WBC) Count

*   **Current Result:** 3.6 x 10^3 cells/µL.
*   **Quest Reference Range:** 3.8 - 10.8 x 10^3 cells/µL, which flagged the current result as low.
*   **Optimal Range for Longevity:** A study examining survival rates correlated with baseline WBC count indicated:
    *   **3.5 - 6 x 10^3 cells/µL:** Median survival of approximately 38 years.
    *   **6 - 10 x 10^3 cells/µL:** Significantly shorter life expectancy of approximately 30 years.
    *   **> 10 x 10^3 cells/µL:** Shortest life expectancy of approximately 25 years (a 13-year difference compared to the optimal range).
    *   **< 3.5 x 10^3 cells/µL:** While appearing to have the shortest life expectancy, this group had only 49 subjects, and the association was not statistically significant.
    *   **Conclusion:** The optimal range for life expectancy appears to be 3.5 - 6 x 10^3 cells/µL. The Quest reference range includes values associated with reduced longevity.
*   **Speaker's Average WBC:** Over 42 tests since 2015, the average WBC is 4.6 x 10^3 cells/µL, which falls within the optimal range of 3.5 - 6 x 10^3 cells/µL.

### Neutrophils

*   **Current Result:** 1519 cells/µL.
*   **Quest Reference Range:** 1500 - 7800 cells/µL. The current result is at the lower border of this range.
*   **Optimal Range for All-Cause Mortality Risk:** A study analyzed all-cause mortality risk against neutrophil counts:
    *   **2 - 3 x 10^3 cells/µL:** Defined as the reference range for comparison.
    *   **> 3 x 10^3 cells/µL:** Significantly increased all-cause mortality risk (95% confidence interval completely above hazard ratio of 1).
    *   **< 2 x 10^3 cells/µL:** Also significantly increased all-cause mortality risk.
    *   **Conclusion:** The optimal range for all-cause mortality risk is 2 - 3 x 10^3 cells/µL. The Quest reference range includes values associated with increased all-cause mortality risk both above and below this optimal range.
*   **Speaker's Average Neutrophils:** Over 42 tests since 2015, the average neutrophil count is 2299 cells/µL, which falls within the optimal range of 2 - 3 x 10^3 cells/µL.

### Other Biomarkers

*   The lipid panel, hsCRP, and glucose were also reviewed. No specific data points or trends were discussed beyond the hsCRP mentioned in the Phenotypic Age section.
