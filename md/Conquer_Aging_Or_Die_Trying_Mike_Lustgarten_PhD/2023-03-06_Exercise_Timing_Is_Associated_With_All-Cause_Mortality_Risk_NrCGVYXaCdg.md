# 2023-03-06 Exercise Timing Is Associated With All-Cause Mortality Risk

## Executive Summary

*   Moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is generally associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality.
*   An optimal MVPA volume of approximately 175 minutes per week correlates with a significant reduction (around 65%) in all-cause mortality risk, with a plateau observed for higher weekly volumes.
*   Performing a mixed proportion (up to 50%) of total MVPA across morning, midday-afternoon, or evening time windows is associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk.
*   Concentrating the majority (>50%) of MVPA in the midday to afternoon period (11:00 AM - 6:00 PM) is associated with the most significant reduction in all-cause mortality risk.
*   Concentrating the majority (>50%) of MVPA in the morning or evening periods did not show the same level of significant reduction in all-cause mortality risk.
*   These findings highlight associations, and further randomized controlled trials are needed to establish causation.

## MVPA Volume and All-Cause Mortality

Moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) is associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk. The data indicates that the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality risk decreases as total MVPA volume in minutes per week increases.

**Methodology for MVPA Calculation:**
*   MVPA was calculated via accelerometry, with devices worn on the wrist.
*   Accelerometers detect the intensity of motion.
*   MVPA was defined as activity with a Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) greater than 3 METs per minute, sustained for at least ten minutes.

**Examples of Activities and METs:**
*   **Activities *not* included (less than 3 METs/min):** Walking slowly (e.g., 2 miles per hour).
*   **Activities *included* (greater than 3 METs/min):** Walking 3 miles an hour, stationary cycling at 50 or 100 watts, a leisurely bike ride, light to moderate calisthenics, or a heavy weightlifting workout.

**Association with Mortality Risk:**
Up to approximately 175 minutes of MVPA per week, there is about a 65% reduction in all-cause mortality risk. Beyond 175 minutes of MVPA per week, a plateau is observed, meaning further significant reductions in all-cause mortality risk were not evident relative to performing about 175 minutes per week. These data were derived from MVPA performed at any time during the day.

## Exercise Timing and All-Cause Mortality Risk

The study investigated whether the timing of exercise impacts all-cause mortality risk, specifically exploring if there is an optimal time of day for MVPA. Three time points were analyzed:

*   **Morning:** 5:00 AM to 11:00 AM
*   **Midday to Afternoon:** 11:00 AM to 6:00 PM
*   **Evening:** 6:00 PM to Midnight

The hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was assessed based on the proportion of total MVPA performed within each of these time windows.

**Findings on Exercise Timing:**
*   Spending up to 50% of total MVPA time at any of these three time points (indicating a mixed approach to exercise timing) was associated with a significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk.
*   For individuals who performed more than 50% of their total MVPA in the midday to afternoon group, a significant reduction in all-cause mortality risk was observed.
*   However, for people who performed more than 50% of their total MVPA in the morning or in the evening, this significant reduction in all-cause mortality risk was not observed. This suggests that performing the majority of MVPA in the midday to afternoon may be most beneficial for reducing all-cause mortality risk.

**Limitations:**
This study establishes an association (correlation) between exercise timing and mortality risk. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to determine if this relationship is causal.
