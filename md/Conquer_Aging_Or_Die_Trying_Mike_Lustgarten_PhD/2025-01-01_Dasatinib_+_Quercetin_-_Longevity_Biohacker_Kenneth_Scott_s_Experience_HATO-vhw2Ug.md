# 2025-01-01 Dasatinib + Quercetin - Longevity Biohacker Kenneth Scott s Experience

## Executive Summary
*   Dasatinib and Quercetin (D+Q) are utilized to eliminate senescent cells, administered orally every two months.
*   An oral protocol involves 50mg dasatinib and 1000mg quercetin per dose.
*   Topical application of D+Q (as a shampoo) is being explored for potential hair growth, applied a few times a week and left on for five minutes.
*   A peptide-based skin cream (OneSkin) effectively penetrates the skin to target and remove senescent cells, leading to a reduction in age spots.

## Dasatinib and Quercetin (D+Q) - Oral Protocol

Dasatinib and quercetin (D+Q) is a senolytic combination targeting senescent cells. Dasatinib is a drug used in the treatment of certain cancers, which means it has passed safety tests in humans. Dr. James Kirkland at the Mayo Clinic is running a series of tests on dasatinib plus quercetin.

**Oral D+Q Protocol:**
*   Take 50mg dasatinib.
*   Take 1000mg quercetin.
*   Administer once every two months.

Kenneth reports very low and consistent senescent cell burden.

## Senescent Cells and Longevity

Senescent cells in the skin are potentially detrimental. Recent research indicates that transplanting senescent cells into young skin can lead to an increase in the aged phenotype in the young animals.

## Topical D+Q for Hair Health

Dr. James Kirkland reported a study where sheep were given a shampoo containing dasatinib and quercetin, hoping to extend their wool-bearing life. Sheep typically produce good quality wool for about three years. This treatment aims to extend the quality wool production by an additional year or two.

Inspired by this research, Kenneth has been using a topical D+Q shampoo.

**Topical D+Q Hair Protocol:**
*   Mix dasatinib plus quercetin into a purchased shampoo.
*   Apply to the head, including eyebrows and previously bald areas.
*   Leave the shampoo on for five minutes.
*   Rinse off.
*   Perform this routine a couple of times a week.

A friend in London, who has been following this protocol for 1.5 years, shows evidence of new hair growth at the back of her head.

## Skin Rejuvenation with OneSkin (Peptide-based Cream)

OneSkin is a peptide-based skin cream designed to target and eliminate senescent cells in the skin.

**Mechanism of Action:**
OneSkin Peptide application -> Penetrates the outer dermis -> Kills senescent cells

Kenneth used OneSkin for about three months. He observed that age marks (brown spots) he had around his face disappeared during this period. After discontinuing use for approximately six months, these dark spots did not reappear. OneSkin also offers a more concentrated version of their face cream for eye application to reduce bagginess.
