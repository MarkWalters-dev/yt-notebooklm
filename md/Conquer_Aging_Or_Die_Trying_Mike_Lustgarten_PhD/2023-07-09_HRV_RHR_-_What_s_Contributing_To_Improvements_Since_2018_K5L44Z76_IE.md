# 2023-07-09 HRV RHR - What's Contributing To Improvements Since 2018

## Executive Summary
*   Increased average daily heart rate variability (HRV) from 47 ms (2018) to 64 ms (2023), a 35% improvement.
*   Decreased average daily resting heart rate (RHR) from 51 bpm (2018) to 44 bpm (2023), a 14% reduction.
*   Higher Average Daily Heart Rate (ADHR) is significantly correlated with worse HRV and RHR, suggesting a need to balance activity.
*   Decreasing body weight is significantly correlated with improved RHR and HRV, approaching more youthful values.

## Exercise Training and its Impact

### Average Daily Heart Rate (ADHR) as an Index of Physical Activity
*   ADHR from a fitness tracker (Whoop) is used as an index of daily physical activity.

### Correlation between ADHR and Resting Heart Rate (RHR)
*   A significant positive correlation (r = 0.63, p < 0.05) exists between ADHR and RHR.
*   This indicates that excessively high daily activity too often is detrimental to resting heart rate.

### Correlation between ADHR and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
*   An inverse correlation exists between ADHR and HRV.
*   This suggests that excessively high daily activity too often is also detrimental to heart rate variability.

### Optimizing the Balance Between Active and Rest Days
*   Finding a balance between active and rest days is crucial for optimizing both HRV and RHR.
*   The observed pattern involves aiming for low activity before a workout day to ensure near-full recovery.
*   After an 80-minute, full-body workout (weights, calisthenics, flexibility, mobility, balance), activity is intentionally reduced for at least two days post-workout.
*   This tapering of activity allows HRV and RHR to recover sufficiently before the next workout.
*   A three-day cycle of activity tapering is a common approach, though adjustments may be needed based on individual recovery.

## Body Weight and its Impact

### Correlation between Body Weight and Resting Heart Rate (RHR)
*   **Long-term Trends:**
    *   Average monthly body weight and average monthly heart rate data from August 2018 to June 2023 show a clear relationship.
    *   During periods of intentional weight loss, RHR has declined.
    *   During periods of weight gain, RHR has increased.
*   **Daily Data:**
    *   Analysis of daily data (nearly 1800 days) reveals a significant positive correlation between body weight and RHR.
    *   As body weight increases, RHR also increases.
    *   Approaching a body weight of 144 pounds correlated with an RHR of approximately 43 beats per minute.
    *   Further reduction in body weight (specifically body fat) is hypothesized to lead to even lower RHR.

### Correlation between Body Weight and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
*   **Long-term Trends:**
    *   While less visually striking than RHR, trends show that during periods of weight loss, HRV has increased.
    *   During at least one period of weight gain, HRV has decreased.
*   **Daily Data:**
    *   Daily data analysis (around 1800 days) shows a significant inverse correlation between body weight and HRV.
    *   Higher body weight is correlated with lower HRV.
    *   As body weight approached 144 pounds, HRV approached approximately 75 milliseconds.
    *   The trend suggests that further weight reduction could lead to higher HRV values, potentially approaching 80 milliseconds.

### Conclusion on Body Weight Impact
*   Both RHR and HRV approach values considered more youthful as body weight decreases. This observation is specific to the individual's data.
