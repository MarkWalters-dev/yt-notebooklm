# 2021-07-08 65 - 100% Lifespan Extension In Drosophila - A Conversation With Dr. Michael Rose Part I

## Executive Summary
*   Experimental evolutionary approaches in Drosophila (fruit flies) can significantly extend lifespan, with average lifespan increases of 65-68% and maximal lifespan increases of up to 100% (doubling).
*   This lifespan extension is achieved by delaying reproduction for many generations, allowing natural selection to favor later aging.
*   The genetic basis for aging and adaptation is complex, involving hundreds of genes, transcripts, and metabolites.
*   Bridging findings from model organisms like fruit flies to human interventions is challenging but can be facilitated by omics data and advanced computational tools like AI and machine learning.
*   Aging is not merely molecular damage but a tunable process of adaptation influenced by natural selection.

## Experimental Evolution for Lifespan Extension in Drosophila

### Methodology
*   **Experimental Setup:** The core protocol involves manipulating the life cycle to delay reproduction.
*   **Procedure:**
    *   Flies are bred exclusively from older adults over multiple generations.
    *   This delay in reproduction is continued for thousands of generations.
    *   Controlled populations with normal reproduction timing are maintained for comparison.
*   **Outcome:** This process leads to populations that evolve later aging and, consequently, extended lifespans.

### Lifespan Data in Drosophila

*   **Average Survival:**
    *   Male flies: Approximately 38 days.
    *   Female flies: Approximately 35 days.
*   **Lifespan Extension:**
    *   **Average Lifespan:**
        *   Male flies: Increased by approximately 68%.
        *   Female flies: Increased by approximately 65%.
    *   **Maximal Lifespan:**
        *   Male flies: Approximately doubled, from around 60 days to over 130 days.
        *   Female flies: Increased by approximately 65%.

## The Role of Natural Selection and Adaptation

*   **Force of Natural Selection on Survival:**
    *   **Childhood:** Very strong, with survival near 100%.
    *   **First Age of Reproduction:** Starts to decline.
    *   **Last Age of Reproduction:** Continues to fall.
    *   **Post-Reproduction:** Death occurs shortly after the last reproductive age.
*   **Evolutionary Principle:** By delaying reproduction to the latest possible point in an organism's life cycle, natural selection can be directed to favor traits that promote survival and well-being at older ages.
*   **Aging as Adaptation:** Aging is viewed not as uncontrollable molecular damage but as a tuned adaptation, often resulting from natural selection's "dereliction" in favoring late-life survival.

## Translating Findings to Human Longevity

*   **Initial Calculation:** Using the rate of lifespan extension observed in fruit flies (80 generations for a doubling of lifespan) and extrapolating to human generation times (approximately 25 years) suggested a timeline of around 2,000 years for similar intervention. This was deemed impractical.
*   **Alternative Strategies:** Since the 1980s, research has focused on developing faster methods for human longevity intervention, moving away from purely experimental evolution.
    *   **Layered Supplementation Approach (Genescient):**
        *   An omic-guided bridging strategy.
        *   Experimentation in fruit flies to identify effective interventions.
        *   Analysis of omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics) in flies.
        *   Bridging this data to human interventions using omics similarities.
        *   Led to a supplement marketed for cognitive health.
    *   **Lyceum (Founded by Dr. Rose and Larry Cabral):** Based on a different intervention strategy.
    *   **AI-Driven Approaches:**
        *   Utilizing AI and machine learning (e.g., FLAM methodology) to bridge the gap between fruit fly genomes and human genomes.
        *   Translating omic effects to clinical efficacy in humans.
        *   Series of publications detailing genomics, AI methodology, and transcriptomics, with metabolomics in progress.

## Complexity of Aging and Adaptation

*   **Genomic Basis:** The genetic underpinnings of aging are complex, involving hundreds of sites in the genome.
*   **Transcriptomic and Metabolomic Tuning:** These genetic changes tune hundreds of transcript levels and hundreds of metabolites, affecting all organ systems.
*   **Interconnectedness:** Nearly all biological aspects are connected to aging, even in simple organisms like fruit flies.
*   **Metazoan Toolkit:** There are significant overlaps in the fundamental mechanisms of adaptation and aging across metazoans, suggesting that research in model organisms like *Drosophila* has broad relevance to human aging.
