# 2022-06-19 Albumin - What's Optimal For Youth And Health 2022 Update

## Executive Summary

*   Albumin is a key biomarker included in at least two blood-based biological age calculators (Levine's, aging.ai).
*   Serum albumin levels naturally decline with age for both men and women.
*   Optimal serum albumin for the lowest all-cause mortality risk is between 45 and 48 grams per liter (4.5 to 4.8 g/dL). Levels below 45 g/L or above 49 g/L are associated with significantly increased mortality risk.
*   In personal N=1 data, beta-carotene intake showed a significant positive correlation with higher albumin levels.
*   However, higher beta-carotene intake also correlated negatively with several other "big picture biomarkers" (e.g., higher glucose, BUN, alkaline phosphatase, LDL, neutrophils, monocytes, and lower lymphocyte percentage), suggesting that maximizing beta-carotene intake for albumin optimization may be detrimental to overall health.

## Albumin and Biological Age

Optimizing albumin is a good starting point for optimizing biological age, as it's included in at least two blood-based biological age calculators: Levine's biological age calculator and aging.ai. The reference range for albumin is 3.4 to 5.4 grams per deciliter (34 to 54 g/L).

## Albumin Levels Across the Lifespan

A study involving approximately 1.1 million people shows that serum albumin levels decline during aging, observed for both men and women, across all age groups up to 100 years old.

## Albumin and All-Cause Mortality Risk

Analysis of all-cause mortality risk in relation to albumin concentration reveals specific optimal ranges:

*   The lowest all-cause mortality risk was observed at an albumin concentration of 46 g/L.
*   The optimal range for lowest risk is 45 to 48 grams per liter (g/L).
    *   An albumin level of 45 g/L serves as the reference (hazard ratio 1.0).
    *   At 46 g/L, the hazard ratio was 0.97, indicating a 3% reduced risk, which was statistically significant.
    *   No data was available for 47 g/L.
    *   At 48 g/L, the hazard ratio was 1.02, but the confidence interval overlapped with one, indicating no significant difference from 45 g/L.
*   Significantly increased risk:
    *   When albumin is less than 45 g/L, there is a significantly increased risk.
    *   At 49 g/L, the hazard ratio was 1.07, indicating a 7% increased risk for all-cause mortality, which was statistically significant.
    *   At 51 g/L, there was a 15% increased all-cause mortality risk.

Youthful levels of albumin, which peak at 45 g/L for women and 46 g/L for men, fall within this optimal range of 45-48 g/L.

Based on aging and all-cause mortality data, optimal albumin is 45 to 48 grams per liter (or 4.5 to 4.8 grams per deciliter).

## Personal N=1 Data: Albumin Tracking

The speaker has tracked his albumin levels through 43 blood tests since 2005.

**Tracking Methodology:**

*   **2005-2013:** Albumin was tracked annually without corresponding diet data.
    *   Average albumin over 7 blood tests: 4.74 g/dL.
*   **2015-Present: Diet and Biomarker Tracking:**
    *   All food has been weighed using a food scale since April 2015.
    *   Food amounts are entered daily into Cronometer (or similar nutrition tracking app).
    *   Cronometer data is exported to a spreadsheet.
    *   Blood biomarkers are tracked concurrently, allowing for correlation analysis between diet and biomarkers.
    *   Since 2016, 36 blood tests for albumin have been recorded corresponding to diet data.
    *   Average albumin over 36 blood tests (2015-2022): 4.94 g/dL.

**Results of Personal Tracking:**

A two-sample t-test showed a significant difference between the two periods. The speaker was able to resist the age-related decline for albumin and significantly increased it instead.

However, the current average albumin level of 4.94 g/dL is higher than the optimal range of 4.5 to 4.8 g/dL, which, according to the all-cause mortality data, could correspond to a 7% increased all-cause mortality risk (similar to 49 g/L). Despite this, analysis of "big picture biomarkers" in the speaker's data (23 biomarkers representing various organ systems) showed no significant correlations with albumin. The closest correlation was with glucose (p-value 0.06, positive correlation), indicating higher albumin trended with higher glucose, but it was not statistically significant.

The speaker's latest albumin test (May 2022) was 4.8 g/dL. Going forward, the speaker aims to limit values higher than 5.0 g/dL (e.g., 5.0, 5.2, 5.4 g/dL previously observed) to consistently stay closer to 4.8 g/dL, which is at the upper threshold of the optimal range.

## Dietary Factors Correlated with Albumin

Analysis of 36 blood tests since 2015 with corresponding diet data allowed for correlation analysis between macronutrients, vitamins, and minerals with albumin.

*   **Macronutrients:** None of the tracked macronutrients (including oxalate, which was categorized here as it's not a vitamin or mineral) showed a significant correlation with albumin.
*   **Minerals:** None of the tracked minerals showed a significant correlation with albumin.
*   **Vitamins:**
    *   None of the vitamins were significantly correlated with albumin, except for Vitamin A and Beta-Carotene.
    *   The significant correlation for Vitamin A is likely driven by beta-carotene, as almost all of the speaker's Vitamin A intake comes from carotenoids.

**Beta-Carotene Intake Details (7-year average):**

*   Average daily beta-carotene intake: approximately 55,000 micrograms (55 milligrams) per day.
*   Source: Entirely from whole foods, not supplements.
*   Primary sources: Carrots, butternut squash, spinach (raw and cooked), sweet potato (orange), red bell pepper, lettuce, and broccoli.

**Beta-Carotene and Albumin Relationship:**

Visualizing albumin versus beta-carotene intake:

*   Lowest beta-carotene intake: ~33,000 micrograms (33 milligrams) per day.
*   Highest beta-carotene intake: ~67,000 micrograms (67 milligrams) per day.
*   Average intake: ~55,000 micrograms (55 milligrams) per day.

There is a positive correlation between beta-carotene intake and albumin levels in the speaker's N=1 data.

## Beta-Carotene and Big Picture Biomarkers

To assess whether maximizing beta-carotene intake for albumin optimization is beneficial for overall health, correlations between beta-carotene intake and 23 "big picture biomarkers" (representative of various organ systems) were analyzed from the speaker's N=1 data.

**Correlations for Beta-Carotene with Big Picture Biomarkers:**

*   **Positive Correlation (Desirable for Albumin):**
    *   Albumin: Significantly correlated with higher albumin (going in the "right" direction for albumin optimization).
*   **Significant Negative Correlations (Undesirable for Overall Health):**
    *   Glucose: Significantly correlated with higher glucose.
    *   Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): Significantly correlated with higher BUN.
    *   Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP): Significantly correlated with higher ALP.
    *   LDL: Significantly correlated with higher LDL.
    *   Neutrophils: Significantly correlated with higher neutrophils.
    *   Monocytes: Significantly correlated with higher monocytes.
    *   Lymphocyte Percentage: Significantly correlated with lower lymphocyte percentage.

These seven negative correlations indicate trends that are generally considered unfavorable for aging and all-cause mortality risk.

**Net Correlative Score:**

*   1 biomarker going in the desired direction (Albumin).
*   7 biomarkers going in the undesired direction.
*   Net correlative score: -6.

This suggests that eating as much beta-carotene as possible might optimize albumin but could worsen other important health markers.

**Current Strategy:**

The speaker's current beta-carotene intake for the next blood test is 50,000 micrograms (50 milligrams) per day. This is purposely below the previous average intake of 55,000 micrograms/day, as a net negative correlative score prompted a reduction in intake. The goal is to balance albumin levels within the optimal range while avoiding adverse effects on other biomarkers.
