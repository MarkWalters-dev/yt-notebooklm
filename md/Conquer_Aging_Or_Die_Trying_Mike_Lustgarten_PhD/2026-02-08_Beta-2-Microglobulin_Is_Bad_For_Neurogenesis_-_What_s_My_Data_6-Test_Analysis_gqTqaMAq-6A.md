# 2026-02-08 Beta-2-Microglobulin Is Bad For Neurogenesis - What s My Data 6-Test Analysis

## Executive Summary

*   Beta-2 Microglobulin (B2M) is a systemic pro-aging factor linked to impaired cognitive function and neurogenesis.
*   In mice, exposure to B2M significantly reduces neurogenesis, while genetic removal of B2M more than doubles neurogenesis.
*   Human post-mortem studies show that brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease have twice the B2M levels compared to controls.
*   Personal B2M levels average 1.58 mg/L, and dietary correlations suggest that cacao intake positively correlates with B2M, while almond, lemon, and potato intake inversely correlate.
*   Strategies to lower personal B2M include reducing cacao and potentially increasing almonds, while monitoring the impact of high strawberry intake.

## Grim Mage and Biomarkers

Grim Mage is an epigenetic clock for evaluating the risk of death. Grim Mage version one incorporates age, gender, an epigenetic approximation of smoking (DNA and pack years), and epigenetic approximations of seven protein biomarkers:
*   **Cystatin C:** A biomarker of kidney function and associated with neurodegeneration.
*   **Leptin**
*   **TIMP-1**
*   **PAI-1**
*   **GDF-15**
*   **ADM**
*   **Beta-2 Microglobulin (B2M):** A kidney function and immune-related biomarker, also linked to neurogenesis.

## B2M's Role in Aging and Neurogenesis

B2M has been identified as a systemic pro-aging factor that impairs cognitive function and neurogenesis. B2M levels increase during aging, and higher levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk. Optimal B2M levels are generally lower, and resistance to age-related increases is desirable.

## Neurogenesis Process

Doublecortin (DCX) expressing cells are a well-known biomarker for neurogenesis, particularly in the dentate gyrus, a region of the brain. The process of neurogenesis proceeds as follows:

Quiescent Neural Stem Cells -> DCX positive cells (Neurogenesis) -> Mature Neurons

## Mouse Data: B2M's Impact on Neurogenesis

### B2M Exposure Impairs Neurogenesis

In mice treated with B2M for 12 days, the neurogenesis biomarker doublecortin declined by approximately 20%. This indicates that relatively high levels of B2M impair neurogenesis. This finding is significant because neurogenesis naturally declines during aging, suggesting a potential causal link given that B2M levels also increase with age.

### B2M Removal Enhances Neurogenesis

To investigate the effect of removing B2M, researchers studied B2M knockout mice (genetically engineered to lack the B2M protein). In an 18-month longitudinal study, 18-month-old B2M knockout mice showed more than two times higher levels of the neurogenesis biomarker doublecortin compared to aged wild-type mice with normal B2M levels.

Collectively, these mouse data suggest that elevated B2M levels, especially those observed during the aging process, are detrimental to neurogenesis.

## Human Evidence

A post-mortem study of human brains found that individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease had two times higher levels of B2M in their brains compared to controls without Alzheimer's disease. This human data aligns with the mouse findings, further implicating B2M in neurodegenerative processes.

## Personal B2M Data and Optimization

The speaker began measuring B2M in 2025, preferring direct biomarker measurements over epigenetic predictions. Over six tests in 2025, the average B2M level was 1.58 mg/L. While not considered terribly high, this level is not as low as desired, as optimal B2M levels are generally lower and should resist age-related increases.

## Dietary Correlation Methodology

To identify potential dietary factors that could influence B2M levels, the speaker employs a rigorous diet tracking and correlation analysis methodology:
*   Since 2015, over 99% of food intake has been weighed using a food scale.
*   Food data is entered into Cronometer, a diet tracking application.
*   Cronometer data, including macronutrients, micronutrients, and individual food amounts, is exported to a spreadsheet.
*   For each blood test, the average dietary intake during the period between the previous and current test is calculated and linked to the biomarker results of the current test.
*   With a sufficient number of blood tests (currently 60+ for many biomarkers), correlations between specific dietary components (foods, nutrients) and biomarker levels are analyzed.
*   This approach helps identify potential dietary strategies for biomarker optimization.

## Dietary Correlations with B2M (6 tests)

Based on six personal B2M tests, the following correlations with dietary intake were observed (P-value < 0.05 indicates statistical significance):
*   **Cacao beans (raw organic):** Positive correlation (higher intake associated with higher B2M).
*   **Almonds:** Inverse correlation (higher intake associated with lower B2M).
*   **Lemon:** Inverse correlation (higher intake associated with lower B2M).
*   **Potatoes:** Inverse correlation (higher intake associated with lower B2M).

It is important to note that these are correlations and do not imply causation. Further experimentation (e.g., intentionally altering intake) is needed to assess causal impact. An almost significant inverse correlation was also observed for strawberries (P = 0.06).

## Action Plan for B2M Reduction

To attempt to lower B2M levels, the speaker's plan involves specific dietary adjustments based on these correlations:

1.  **Reduce Cacao Beans:** Based on the positive correlation, cacao beans have been removed from the diet for the next testing period.
2.  **Increase Almond Intake (with caution):** Almonds show an inverse correlation. The goal is to aim for 20-25g of almonds per day, up from the current average of 19g/day since the last test. However, increasing almond intake significantly is tempered by two factors:
    *   In the speaker's personal data, higher intake of monounsaturated fats (abundant in almonds) correlates with higher glucose levels.
    *   Almonds are a rich source of oxalate, and their oxalate-to-calcium ratio suggests that a portion of oxalate will be absorbed rather than excreted, raising concerns about oxalate levels.
    These constraints prevent a more substantial increase in almond consumption.
3.  **Monitor Strawberry Intake:** High strawberry intake (currently ~3 lbs/day) presents a potential confounding factor. While the correlation for strawberries was close to significant (P=0.06), its impact is uncertain. If B2M levels do not decrease as expected from the cacao and almond adjustments, strawberry intake will be considered for reduction. Reducing strawberries is challenging due to their satiating properties, which are valuable in a calorie-restricted diet.

The next B2M test is scheduled for January 30th, 2026, to evaluate the impact of these dietary changes.
