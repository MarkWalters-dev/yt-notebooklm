# 2020-11-25 HDL - What's Optimal For Minimizing Disease Risk And Maximizing Longevity

## Executive Summary

*   Optimal HDL for the lowest all-cause mortality, based on a meta-analysis of subjects up to 85 years old, is 52-56 mg/dL for men and 58-62 mg/dL for women. Mortality risk increases significantly at both lower and higher HDL levels.
*   Studies in older adults (85-99 years) and centenarians (100-104 years) suggest average HDL levels associated with increased probability of reaching these ages are typically in the mid-fifties (53-59 mg/dL).
*   For extreme longevity (semi-centenarians 105-109 years and supercentenarians ≥110 years), observed HDL levels are lower (44-45 mg/dL). This may indicate a decline towards the end of life, as offspring of centenarians show higher HDL (54 mg/dL) at younger ages (average 76 years).
*   A potential mechanism for HDL's influence on longevity involves inflammation: higher HDL levels are inversely correlated with lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels. This correlation is observed in personal data (r = -0.68, p < 0.05) and supported by larger population studies (p < 0.001).

## Optimal HDL for All-Cause Mortality (Up to Age 85)

A meta-analysis of 24 studies, involving approximately 3.4 million subjects, examined the relationship between HDL and all-cause mortality.

*   **Men:** The lowest risk for all-cause mortality was found with HDL values between 52-56 mg/dL. All-cause mortality risk increased at both lower and higher HDL levels, with the highest risk observed for HDL levels greater than 92 mg/dL.
*   **Women:** The lowest risk for all-cause mortality was found with HDL values between 58-62 mg/dL. Risk significantly increased with values either lower or higher than this range, with the highest risk for HDL levels greater than 120 mg/dL.
*   These data include subjects up to 85 years old.

## HDL in Older Adults and Centenarians

Studies focusing on older populations provide further insights into HDL levels associated with longevity:

*   **Adults 85-99 Years Old:**
    *   One study found an average HDL of 59 mg/dL in this age group.
    *   Data from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and the Long Life Family Study (LLFS), including about 1,900 subjects with an average age of 87 years, reported average HDL values of 55 mg/dL and 55.9 mg/dL, respectively.
    *   These findings suggest that HDL values in the mid-fifties may be associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality and an increased probability of living beyond 85 years.

*   **Centenarians (≥100 Years Old):**
    *   In 275 centenarians aged 100-104 years, the average HDL was 53 mg/dL.
    *   Another study of 1,002 centenarians, with an average age of 102 years, showed an average HDL of 54 mg/dL. These values remain in the mid-fifties, suggesting this range may be optimal for reaching centenarian age.

*   **Extreme Longevity (Semi- and Supercentenarians):**
    *   For semi-centenarians (105-109 years), average HDL was 45 mg/dL.
    *   For supercentenarians (≥110 years), average HDL was 44 mg/dL.
    *   These lower values suggest that HDL may be higher in the mid-fifties in younger years and decline towards the end of life.
    *   Support for this hypothesis comes from a study of 167 offspring of centenarians (average age 76 years), where the average HDL was 54 mg/dL. This implies that centenarians may have had HDL values in the fifties when they were younger, which later declined.

*   **Cumulative Suggestion:** Collectively, these data indicate that an HDL range of 55-60 mg/dL may be optimal for overall health and longevity.

## Mechanism: HDL and Inflammation (hs-CRP)

One potential mechanism through which HDL may impact lifespan involves inflammation, specifically high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP).

*   **Personal Data:**
    *   Analysis of personal blood tests shows an inverse correlation between HDL and hs-CRP. Higher HDL levels are associated with lower hs-CRP levels.
    *   An HDL of 56 mg/dL was associated with an hs-CRP of 0.2 mg/L, a level considered optimal (less than 0.3 mg/L).
    *   Conversely, the lowest HDL (28 mg/dL) correlated with the highest hs-CRP levels.
    *   The correlation coefficient between personal HDL and hs-CRP is -0.68, indicating a moderately strong and statistically significant inverse relationship (p < 0.05).

*   **Population Studies:**
    *   Studies including 6,000 subjects (average age in the mid-forties) also demonstrated inverse correlations between HDL and hs-CRP for both men and women.
    *   For men, the lowest hs-CRP was associated with an HDL of around 50 mg/dL.
    *   For women, the lowest hs-CRP was associated with an HDL of around 61 mg/dL.
    *   Despite weak correlation coefficients in these larger studies (men: -0.04; women: -0.009), the relationship between higher HDL and lower hs-CRP was consistently observed and statistically significant (p < 0.001), suggesting a prevalent trend in the general population.

## Dietary Factors Correlated with HDL

To achieve optimal HDL levels (around 55 mg/dL for men), personal diet tracking data was analyzed.

**Diet Tracking Protocol:**
*   For the past five years, diet has been meticulously tracked using a food scale, weighing and logging all consumed food. This provides macronutrient and micronutrient data.
*   For the last two years, specific food intake has also been logged, allowing for correlation analysis between individual foods/food groups and biomarkers.

**Observed Correlations with HDL:**
*   **Cocoa Bean Intake:** Higher average daily cocoa bean intake correlated with higher HDL (r = 0.54, p = 0.07).
*   **Coconut Butter Intake:** Higher average daily coconut butter intake correlated with higher HDL (r = 0.49, p = 0.1).
*   **Sunflower Seed Intake:** Higher average daily sunflower seed intake strongly correlated with higher HDL (r = 0.61, p < 0.05).
*   **Walnut Intake:** Higher average daily walnut intake correlated with higher HDL (r = 0.52, p = 0.07).

**Combined Nut and Seed Intake:**
When the average daily intake of these four specific nuts and seeds (cocoa beans, coconut butter, sunflower seeds, and walnuts) was combined and correlated with HDL, a strong relationship was observed:
*   **Correlation Coefficient:** r = 0.85
*   **Explained Variability:** 73% of the variability in HDL levels could be explained by the daily intake of these four nuts and seeds.
*   **Statistical Significance:** The p-value was highly significant (p < 0.001).
This suggests that a high intake of these specific nuts and seeds may significantly contribute to increased HDL levels.
