## Diet Composition (October 24 - December 11, 2022)

This data represents the average daily dietary intake for the 49-day period preceding blood test 7 in 2022. All food was weighed using a food scale, and data was tracked using Chronometer.

### Overall Intake

*   **Average Daily Calorie Intake:** 2235 calories
    *   This is the lowest average daily calorie intake recorded since April 2015.

### Macronutrients

#### Protein

*   **Average Daily Protein Intake:** 97 grams
*   **Percentage of Total Calories:** 17.3%
*   **Protein per Kilogram Body Weight:** 1.4 g/kg (based on a body weight of 68 kg)
    *   This intake level is on the ascending portion of the curve for optimizing muscle mass with strength training.

#### Fat

*   **Average Daily Total Fat Intake:** 82.8 grams
*   **Percentage of Total Calories:** Approximately 33%
*   **Breakdown of Fat Types:** (Specific percentages/grams for monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, saturated, and trans fats were mentioned but not fully detailed in the transcript. Cholesterol data was also mentioned.)

#### Carbohydrates

*   **Average Daily Carbohydrate Intake:** 314 grams
*   **Average Daily Fiber Intake:** 87 grams
*   **Average Daily Net Carbohydrate Intake:** 228 grams (Carbohydrates - Fiber)
*   **Percentage of Total Calories (Net Carbs):** 40.9% (Calculated as 914 calories from net carbs / 2235 total calories * 100)
    *   *Note: A discrepancy was noted in Chronometer's carb counts, where subtracting protein and fat percentages from 100% did not align with the calculated carbohydrate percentage.*

#### Sugar and Fructose

*   **Total Fructose Intake:** Approximately 59 grams per day
    *   Calculated as (total sugar / 2) + fructose.
    *   This is the lowest fructose intake recorded since diet tracking began in 2035. Previous intake was close to 115 grams per day.

### Micronutrients

#### Vitamins

*   Specific daily intake for all vitamins was tracked.
*   **Purposeful Targets:**
    *   **Niacin (Vitamin B3):** Aimed for >40 mg per day due to a strong positive correlation with blood biomarkers.
    *   **Beta Carotene:** Aimed for ~50 mg (50,000 mcg) per day. Data suggests a strong negative correlation with blood biomarkers, so intake is titrated to find an optimal range, not the highest.
    *   **Vitamin E:** Aimed for ~20 mg per day. The RDA is 15 mg. Intake is kept below the highest intake (~30 mg) due to negative correlations with blood biomarkers.

#### Minerals

*   All mineral intakes were reported to be higher than the RDA.
*   No specific purposeful targets were set, but intake is monitored for correlations with blood biomarkers.

### "Cheat Days"

*   During the 49-day period, two separate cheat days were incorporated.
*   **Cheesecake:** Approximately 1200 calories consumed over two days, averaging 25 calories per day. Contributed 1.7% to total calories.
*   **Candy (Mike and Ike):** Approximately 150 grams consumed over two days, averaging 3 grams per day, contributing ~600 calories. Contributed 1.7% to total calories.
    *   Combined, cheesecake and candy contributed 1.7% of the total calories during this period.
