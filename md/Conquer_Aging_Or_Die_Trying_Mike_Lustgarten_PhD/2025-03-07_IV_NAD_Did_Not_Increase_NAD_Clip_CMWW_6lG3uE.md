# 2025-03-07 IV NAD Did Not Increase NAD Clip

## Executive Summary
*   While Intravenous (IV) NAD+ demonstrates clinical efficacy for certain neurological conditions and infectious diseases, its effectiveness for general longevity, alertness, and energy is a separate question.
*   A clinical trial involving 10 individuals showed no change in intracellular NAD levels after five separate IV NAD+ sessions.
*   Each IV session administered a significant dose of 750 milligrams of NAD+.
*   Subsequently, the administration of oral supplements (referred to as a 'vitality boost') effectively increased intracellular NAD levels in most of these individuals, often surpassing 40 micromolar.
*   One participant, despite receiving over 1000 milligrams of oral NMN, did not experience an increase in NAD levels.

## IV NAD Efficacy for Longevity/Energy
It is important to note that IV NAD+ does possess clinical efficacy for neurological conditions and infectious diseases in administered individuals. However, the goal for longevity, alertness, and energy improvement is to increase intracellular NAD levels.

A clinical trial involving 10 individuals investigated whether IV NAD+ could achieve this.

### IV NAD+ Protocol
*   **Participants:** 10 individuals
*   **Sessions:** 5 IV NAD+ sessions
*   **Dosage:** 750 milligrams of NAD+ per session

### Results
Following the five sessions of IV NAD+ at a high dosage, intracellular NAD levels in these individuals did not change.

## Oral Supplement Efficacy
Following the IV NAD+ intervention, the same individuals were given oral supplements, referred to as a 'vitality boost'.

### Results
*   In most individuals, intracellular NAD levels increased, often reaching higher than 40 micromolar.
*   One specific individual showed an increase but their levels were not optimized. This participant required more than 1000 milligrams of NMN, and even then, their NAD levels did not increase.
*   Overall, oral supplements demonstrated an efficient ability to increase intracellular NAD levels in most participants.
