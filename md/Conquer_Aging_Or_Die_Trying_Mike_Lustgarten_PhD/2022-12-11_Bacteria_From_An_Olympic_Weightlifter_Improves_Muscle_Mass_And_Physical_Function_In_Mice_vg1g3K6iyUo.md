# 2022-12-11 Bacteria From An Olympic Weightlifter Improves Muscle Mass And Physical Function In Mice

## Executive Summary

*   Supplementation with *Lactobacillus plantarum* isolated from an Olympic weightlifter (Tana) significantly increased relative muscle mass in mice compared to vehicle controls.
*   Treatment significantly reduced fat mass (specifically the epididymal fat pad, EFP) and increased cecal weight, a major site of Short Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) production.
*   Mice receiving the bacteria showed significant improvements in physical performance, including increased relative grip strength and longer time to exhaustion in a swimming test.
*   The supplementation altered the gut microbiome composition, notably causing a significant decrease in the relative abundance of the Firmicutes phylum and a significant increase in the Bacteroidetes phylum in the highest dose groups.
*   Neither initial body weight nor daily food/water intake differed significantly between the supplemented and vehicle control groups, suggesting the benefits were not due to changes in general consumption or weight gain.

## Experimental Context

The study investigated the effect of a specific bacterium isolated from Olympic weightlifter Sing Chun Quo (Tana) on muscle mass and physical function in mice.

### Intervention Protocol

1.  **Bacterial Isolation:** *Lactobacillus plantarum* was isolated from the feces of the athlete Tana.
2.  **Model:** Young, six-week-old male ICR mice were used.
3.  **Supplementation:** Mice were transplanted with *L. plantarum* once per day for four weeks.
4.  **Groups:**
    *   Vehicle control (no supplementation).
    *   Tana 1x concentration.
    *   Tana 2x concentration.
    *   Tana 5x concentration.

## Mouse Data: Impact on Tissue Mass

Relative tissue weight was calculated as (Tissue Weight / 100) * 100%. Four groups were compared: Vehicle, Tana 1x, Tana 2x, and Tana 5x.

### Muscle and Fat Mass Changes

*   **Muscle Mass:** All Tana supplementation groups (1x, 2x, and 5x) showed a significantly increased relative muscle weight compared to the vehicle group (Vehicle: 0.95% vs. Tana groups: 0.99%, 0.99%, and 1.04%, respectively).
*   **Fat Mass (EFP):** Fat mass, specifically the epididymal fat pad (EFP), was reduced in the treated groups. The Tana 5x group showed a significantly reduced EFP percentage (0.74%) compared to the vehicle group (0.90%).
*   **Cecum Weight:** Relative cecum weight, a site for SCFA production, was significantly increased in the Tana 5x group compared to the vehicle group (Vehicle: 2.66%).

### Food and Water Intake Analysis

Comparison between the vehicle group and all three Tana supplementation groups revealed no significant differences in the following parameters:
*   Initial body weight
*   Final body weight
*   Water intake
*   Dietary intake (grams of food consumed per mouse per day)

## Mouse Data: Impact on Physical Function

### Grip Strength

Relative grip strength (Grip Strength / Body Weight * 100%) was measured across the four groups.
*   All Tana supplementation groups (1x, 2x, and 5x) demonstrated significantly increased relative grip strength compared to the vehicle group.
*   A plateau effect was observed where Tana 2x and Tana 5x groups did not significantly differ from each other in grip strength, but both demonstrated higher strength than the Tana 1x and Vehicle groups.

### Aerobic Exercise Capacity (Time to Exhaustion)

A swimming test measured time to exhaustion:
*   The Tana-supplemented groups showed a significantly increased time to exhaustion compared with the vehicle group, indicating improved aerobic capacity.
*   The Tana 2x and Tana 5x groups achieved the longest time to exhaustion, which was significantly longer than both the Tana 1x and Vehicle groups.

## Gut Microbiome Alterations

The observed changes in cecum mass suggested an alteration in the gut microbiome composition.

### Beta Diversity

*   A beta diversity plot indicated that the gut bacterial communities of the vehicle group projected to a different space compared to the Tana 1x group.
*   Furthermore, the Tana 2x and Tana 5x groups projected into a different space when compared to both Tana 1x and Vehicle groups, suggesting an overall different microbiome composition driven by higher doses.

### Relative Abundance (Phylum Level)

The most abundant phyla were Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes.
*   **Vehicle vs. Tana Groups:** The vehicle group composition was overwhelmingly comprised of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes.
*   **Tana 2x and Tana 5x vs. Vehicle:** These higher dose groups showed:
    *   A significant **decrease** in the relative abundance of **Firmicutes**.
    *   A significant **increase** in the relative abundance of **Bacteroidetes**.

## Conclusion: Gut-Muscle Axis Impact

Supplementation of *Lactobacillus plantarum* isolated from the Olympic weightlifter resulted in a positive impact on the gut-muscle axis in young mice:
1.  Altered cecum weight.
2.  Altered gut microbiome composition.
3.  Improved muscle mass.
4.  Reduced fat mass.
