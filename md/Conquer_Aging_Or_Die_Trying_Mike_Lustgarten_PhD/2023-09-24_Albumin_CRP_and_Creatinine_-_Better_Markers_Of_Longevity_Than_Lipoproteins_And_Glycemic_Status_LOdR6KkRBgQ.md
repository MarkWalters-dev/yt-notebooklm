# 2023-09-24 Albumin CRP and Creatinine - Better Markers Of Longevity Than Lipoproteins And Glycemic Status

## Executive Summary
*   Albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and creatinine appear to be stronger indicators of longevity than lipoproteins and glycemic status (HbA1c).
*   Higher albumin levels are associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality in individuals aged 85 and older.
*   Higher levels of C-reactive protein and creatinine are associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality in the same age group.
*   Lipoproteins (HDL, LDL) and HbA1c showed no significant association with all-cause mortality in this study cohort.

## Study Cohort
The study included individuals aged 85 years and older, categorized as follows:
*   531 individuals aged 85-99 years.
*   288 centenarians (aged 100-104 years).
*   572 semi-supercentenarians (aged 105-109 years).
*   36 supercentenarians (aged 110+ years).

## Association with All-Cause Mortality Risk (Hazard Ratio - HR)

### Lipoproteins (HDL, LDL) and Glycemic Status (HbA1c)
*   The 95% confidence intervals for HDL, LDL, and HbA1c completely overlapped with 1.
*   This indicates no significant association with all-cause mortality risk within the study population (aged 85 to over 110 years).

### Albumin
*   The 95% confidence interval for albumin was completely below 1.
*   This suggests that relatively higher albumin levels are associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality.

### Creatinine and C-Reactive Protein (CRP)
*   The 95% confidence intervals for creatinine and CRP were completely above 1.
*   This indicates that relatively higher levels of CRP and creatinine are associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality.

## Conclusion on Longevity Markers
Based on these findings, for the goal of achieving maximum longevity, the data suggests that:
*   Relatively high albumin levels.
*   Relatively low C-reactive protein levels.
*   Relatively low creatinine levels.

May serve as better indicators of longevity compared to glycemic status and lipoproteins.
