# 2023-04-23 Epigenetic Test 5 - Impact of NMN

### Executive Summary

*   **NMN Protocol:** Average NMN intake was 340 mg/day for 42 days, increasing to 1000 mg/day for 7 days prior to the test.
*   **Dunedin Pace:** The result for Test #5 was 0.79, consistent with Test #4 (0.78), indicating no impact from NMN. This value is an improvement over the first three tests (0.89, 0.82, 0.80).
*   **Horvath Epigenetic Age:** The result for Test #5 was 52.99 years (3 years older than chronological age), which is the lowest Horvath age recorded over five tests and a 2-year reduction from the previous average.
*   **Hannam Epigenetic Age:** The result for Test #5 was 42.08 years (8 years younger than chronological age), which is the highest Hannam age recorded over five tests, suggesting a potential negative impact or normal variation.
*   **Overall Conclusion:** Despite NMN supplementation, diet and physical activity were consistent between Test #4 and Test #5. The mixed results (Dunedin Pace unchanged, Horvath better, Hannam worse) suggest NMN had no definitive effect on epigenetic age, and observed changes may be normal variation.

## NMN Protocol

The NMN intake leading up to Test #5 was as follows:
*   **Average NMN intake (42 days):** 340 mg/day
*   **Increased NMN intake (7 days prior to Test #5):** 1000 mg/day

The epigenetic tests used were Dunedin Pace, Horvath, and Hannam, generated with True Diagnostic.

## Previous Epigenetic Test Results (Test #4)

*   **Dunedin Pace:** 0.78
*   **Horvath Epigenetic Age:** 5 years older than chronological age
*   **Hannam Epigenetic Age:** 11 years younger than chronological age

## Dunedin Pace

### Importance of Dunedin Pace

Dunedin Pace is significant because it uniquely identified a younger biological age in individuals on a 12% calorie-restricted (CR) diet for two years, unlike other epigenetic clocks such as Horvath, Hannam, PhenoAge, GrimAge, or the earlier iteration, Dunedin Poam. Data demonstrated that people on CR consistently had a younger epigenetic age at both the 12-month and 24-month time points, as identified by Dunedin Pace.

### Interpretation of Dunedin Pace

Dunedin Pace measures the epigenetic aging rate:
*   **0.6:** Represents the slowest epigenetic aging rate, meaning for every one year of chronological age, epigenetic age increases by 0.6 years.
*   **1.4:** Represents the fastest epigenetic aging rate, meaning for every one year of chronological age, epigenetic age increases by 1.4 years.

### Dunedin Pace Results (Test #5)

The Dunedin Pace value for Test #5 was 0.79.
*   This is essentially the same as Test #4 (0.78), indicating no change attributable to NMN.
*   The values of 0.79 and 0.78 are better than the first three recorded values: 0.89, 0.82, and 0.80.

## Horvath Epigenetic Age

### Importance of Horvath Epigenetic Age

Horvath's test, also known as Intrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration (IEAA), is a marker of cell-intrinsic aging and shows a strong correlation with chronological age. It is a multi-tissue clock, encompassing various cell types including breast, buccal cells, brain, cerebellum, and colon. The first iteration of the Horvath clock had a correlation coefficient of 0.94 with chronological age, while the second iteration had a coefficient of 0.85, confirming its robust correlation. In fact, it is the most strongly correlated with chronological age among all epigenetic clocks.

### Horvath Epigenetic Age Results (Test #5)

*   **Average for first four tests:** 54.9 years, which was 4 to 7 years older than chronological age.
*   **Test #5 result:** 52.99 years, which is 3 years older than chronological age.
*   This is the lowest Horvath epigenetic age recorded over the five tests, representing a 2-year epigenetic age reduction. It is unclear if this reduction is directly caused by NMN or falls within normal variation.

## Hannam Epigenetic Age

### Importance of Hannam Epigenetic Age

Hannam's epigenetic test, also known as Extrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration (EEAA), serves as a marker of immune system aging.

### Hannam Epigenetic Age Results (Test #5)

*   **Test #5 result:** 42.08 years, which is 8 years younger than chronological age.
*   **Average for first four tests:** 38.3 years, which was 10 to 12 years younger than chronological age.
*   The Test #5 result is the highest Hannam epigenetic age recorded over the five tests, suggesting a potential worsening or negative impact from NMN compared to previous results.

## Analysis of Other Variables

To assess if variables other than NMN could explain the epigenetic age changes, diet and physical activity were compared between the 42-day periods preceding Test #4 and Test #5.

### Diet

*   Macro and micronutrients, including calorie intake, were analyzed.
*   A two-sample t-test showed p-values greater than 0.05 for all comparisons, indicating no significant differences in diet between the two periods.

### Physical Activity

*   Average daily heart rate (not resting heart rate) was used as an index of physical activity.
*   For both periods, the average daily heart rate was 55 beats per minute, showing no significant difference.

### Body Weight

*   Body weight was significantly lower for Test #5 compared to Test #4.
*   The specific impact of this body weight difference on the varied epigenetic test results (Horvath improving, Hannam worsening, Dunedin Pace unchanged) is currently unknown and requires future correlation analysis.

## Conclusion

Based on these data, there was no conclusive effect of NMN on epigenetic age. Dunedin Pace remained largely unchanged, Horvath showed a slight improvement, and Hannam indicated a slight worsening. This pattern suggests a net neutral effect, and the observed changes in Horvath and Hannam may be attributable to normal biological variation rather than NMN supplementation.
