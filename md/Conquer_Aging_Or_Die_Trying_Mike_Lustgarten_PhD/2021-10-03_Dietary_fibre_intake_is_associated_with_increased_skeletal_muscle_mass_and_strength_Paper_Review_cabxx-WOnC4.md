# 2021-10-03 Dietary fibre intake is associated with increased skeletal muscle mass and strength Paper Review

## Executive Summary
*   Increased dietary fiber intake (up to 50 g/day) is significantly associated with lower body mass and Body Mass Index (BMI) in US adults.
*   Higher fiber intake correlates with increased relative total whole body lean mass and appendicular lean mass (a proxy for skeletal muscle mass).
*   Increased fiber intake is associated with higher relative combined grip strength and higher relative total body bone mineral content.
*   Higher fiber intake is associated with lower whole body fat mass and trunk fat mass, which correlates with improved insulin sensitivity (lower HOMA-IR score) and lower fasting insulin levels.

## Study Methodology and Adjustments
The human data presented originates from the **NHANES 2011 through 2018** survey.

### Adjustments in Statistical Models
All models presented were adjusted for factors known to influence the measured associations, including:
*   Gender, age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.
*   Smoking status and physical activity level (defined as sedentary activity).
*   Dietary factors: total calorie intake, alcohol intake, and diet composition (percentage of calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat).

### Measurement Protocols
*   **Body Composition:** Assessed using Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA), providing data on whole body lean mass, whole body fat mass, and whole body bone mineral content.
*   **Muscle Mass Proxy:** Appendicular lean mass (lean mass of arms + legs divided by body weight) was used as a marker for skeletal muscle mass, as it excludes major organs.
*   **Strength Measurement:** Relative combined grip strength (right + left hand strength divided by body weight).
*   **Insulin Sensitivity:** Assessed using HOMA-2 IR (Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance).

## Human Observational Data: Fiber and Body Composition
The analysis plots dietary fiber intake (grams per day, up to approximately 50 g/day) against various body composition metrics.

### Body Mass and BMI
*   **Body Mass & BMI:** Both body mass and BMI show a negative association with increasing dietary fiber intake across both linear and non-linear models. Higher fiber intake is associated with lower body mass and BMI.
    *   *Sample Size for Body Mass/BMI:* Over 6,000 people, average age 50 years.

### Lean Mass and Strength
*   **Whole Body Lean Mass:** Higher dietary fiber intake is associated with higher relative total whole body lean mass (divided by body weight).
*   **Appendicular Lean Mass (Skeletal Muscle Proxy):** Higher dietary fiber intake is associated with higher relative appendicular lean mass (divided by body weight).
*   **Grip Strength:** Higher dietary fiber intake is associated with higher relative combined grip strength (divided by body weight).
    *   *Sample Size for Strength Data:* Approximately 5,300 subjects, average age 58 years.

### Bone Health
*   **Bone Mineral Content:** Relative total body bone mineral content shows an increase with fiber intake. A significantly higher level of bone mineral content is observed when fiber intake exceeds approximately 20 grams per day.

### Fat Mass
*   **Whole Body Fat Mass:** An inverse association is observed; the higher the dietary fiber intake (up to 50 g/day), the lower the relative levels of whole body fat mass. Similar inverse associations were noted for trunk fat mass.

## Human Observational Data: Fiber and Metabolic Health
The metabolic data investigates the relationship between fiber intake and markers of glucose regulation.

*   **Fasting Glucose:** Statistically significant, though small, evidence suggested that higher fiber intake is associated with slightly lower fasted glucose levels.
*   **Fasting Insulin:** A stronger, significant association was found: higher dietary fiber intake correlates with lower levels of fasting insulin for both linear and non-linear models.
*   **Insulin Sensitivity (HOMA-2 IR):** Higher levels of dietary fiber are associated with lower HOMA-2 IR scores, indicating improved insulin sensitivity. This trend followed the observed changes in fasting insulin.

## Causality and Future Research
The presented data establishes associations only. There are currently no Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) investigating the impact of fiber intakes greater than 50 g/day on body composition in older adults.

### Existing RCT Evidence
One RCT studied the impact of high fiber on insulin sensitivity in older adults (average age 53):
*   **Protocol:** Subjects switched from a baseline diet of 20 g/day of fiber to 51 g/day of fiber.
*   **Finding:** Increasing fiber intake to 51 g/day resulted in a **29% reduction** in insulin levels.

### Conclusion on Causality
The presentation suggests a need for future RCTs to test the hypothesis that very high fiber diets (>50 g/day) can causally improve body composition and metabolic features, including insulin sensitivity, in older adults.
