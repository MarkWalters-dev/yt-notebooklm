# 2024-05-15 PD Mangan - Fit At 69-Diet And Exercise Approach

## Executive Summary

*   **High-Intensity, Brief Training:** A workout approach of once every four days, lasting a maximum of 30 minutes, focusing on compound exercises to momentary muscular failure with minimal rest between exercises.
*   **Time Under Tension is Key:** Repetitions are less important than the duration a muscle is under tension (typically 45-90 seconds per set) to stimulate muscle growth and strength.
*   **Dietary Protein Emphasis and Intermittent Fasting:** Prioritizing protein intake, especially at breakfast and lunch, with an eating window generally from 10 AM to 6 PM, incorporating intermittent fasting as a flexible practice.
*   **Iron Regulation for Health:** Maintaining low to low-normal ferritin levels, particularly through regular blood donation, is associated with reduced mortality and improved health outcomes, as excess iron can contribute to oxidative stress and inflammation.
*   **Strategic Sun Exposure:** Aiming for 20-30 minutes of daily sun exposure without sunscreen is beneficial for vitamin D, nitric oxide production, and overall well-being, while avoiding prolonged, unprotected exposure.

## Exercise Approach

### Workout Frequency and Duration

*   Workouts occur approximately once every four days, with the specific day varying.
*   An extra rest day is taken if not feeling up to training.
*   Workouts last a maximum of 30 minutes.

### Training Methodology: High-Intensity Training (HIT)

*   **Focus:** Training for fitness improvement, distinct from general physical activity.
*   **Type:** Resistance training, specifically High-Intensity Training (HIT).
*   **Exercises:** Primarily compound exercises that engage large muscle groups and multiple joints (e.g., chest press, deadlifts, chin-ups, leg press, overhead press, seated rows).
*   **Intensity:** Exercises are performed to momentary muscular failure (the point where no further repetitions can be completed with good form).
*   **Sets:** Only one set per exercise is performed.
*   **Rest:** Minimal to no rest is taken between exercises to maintain an elevated heart rate, contributing to cardiovascular conditioning.
*   **Muscle Group Targeting:** No more than two different exercises are used per muscle group.
*   **Isolation Exercises:** A few isolation exercises (e.g., biceps curls, triceps pulldowns) may be included towards the end of the workout.
*   **Metabolic Finisher:** Each workout concludes with a short, intense cardiovascular burst, typically on a stationary cycle with high resistance for 20-25 seconds to reach near-maximal heart rate.

### Set Extension Techniques

*   **Rest-Pause:** Used for bodyweight exercises like chin-ups. After reaching failure, short rests (up to 10 seconds) are taken to perform additional repetitions.
*   **Drop Sets:** Used for machine exercises. After reaching failure, the weight is reduced by 10-15% to perform further repetitions.

### Time Under Tension (TUT)

*   The primary driver of muscle stimulus, aiming for 45-90 seconds of tension per set.
*   Rep speed varies by exercise, but focus is on controlled movements (e.g., 7-8 seconds up/down for seated rows, 5 seconds up/down for biceps curls).
*   The goal is to hit failure within the 45-90 second window; if failure is reached too quickly, the weight is too high; if it takes longer, the weight is too low.
*   This duration is chosen to optimize anaerobic energy system utilization for strength and muscle gains, avoiding excessive reliance on aerobic metabolism which occurs with longer durations.

### Safety and Injury Prevention

*   **Priority:** Preventing injury is the number one priority.
*   **Warm-up:** Not performed for most exercises, as the initial reps of the chosen weight are not heavy enough to pose an immediate injury risk. For exercises like deadlifts, a few warm-up reps may be done.
*   **Explosive Movements:** Avoided in training to minimize injury risk. Sports and powerlifting/Olympic lifting are considered distinct from exercise in this regard.
*   **Negatives:** Slow negatives (eccentric phase of the movement) are incorporated, but with caution to avoid overtraining and increased injury risk.
*   **Overtraining Avoidance:** Strict adherence to the 30-minute workout limit and listening to the body to prevent overtraining symptoms.

### Past Training Evolution

*   Previously a runner for many years, including marathons.
*   Transitioned to weightlifting about 15 years ago.
*   Trained conventionally for 6-7 years before discovering and adopting High-Intensity Training.

## Diet Approach

### Eating Window and Intermittent Fasting

*   **Eating Window:** Typically an 8-hour window, roughly from 10 AM to 6 PM.
*   **Intermittent Fasting (IF):** Practiced flexibly; generally, no food is consumed for 5-6 hours after waking up.
*   **Fasting Duration:** Eating typically begins around 10-11 AM and ends before 6 PM.

### Macronutrient Focus

*   **Protein Emphasis:** A significant focus on protein intake throughout the day.
*   **Low Carb (Generally):** Follows a generally low-carbohydrate approach.
*   **Dietary Fat:** Consumed but not excessively, avoiding the "massive amounts" of fat sometimes promoted in low-carb circles.

### Meal Structure and Examples

*   **Upon Waking:** Copious amounts of tea.
*   **Breakfast (after fasting period):** High-protein options like nonfat Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, or eggs.
*   **Lunch:** Similar to breakfast, kept relatively light.
*   **Dinner:** Typically includes meat (e.g., steak) with vegetables or salad.
*   **Beverages:** Enjoys a couple of glasses of wine with dinner.

### Calorie Intake and Monitoring

*   **Satiety-Based:** Primarily relies on satiety signals for intake, rather than strict calorie counting.
*   **Daily Weigh-ins:** Used as a primary tool to gauge hunger and adjust intake; a slightly higher scale weight can indicate less hunger.
*   **Water Retention:** Recognizes that fluctuations in weight can be due to salt or carbohydrate intake (water retention) rather than significant calorie surplus.

### Food Preferences and Avoidances

*   **Whole Foods:** Emphasizes whole, unprocessed foods.
*   **Ultra-Processed Foods:** Avoided due to their potential to disrupt gut-brain signaling and auto-regulation. Consumed very rarely, if at all.
*   **Desserts:** Consumed only a few times a year.
*   **Restaurants:** Considered challenging for maintaining dietary goals due to social factors and hyperpalatable food.

## Sun, Grounding, and Longevity

### Sun Exposure

*   **No Sunscreen:** Does not use sunscreen.
*   **Moderate Duration:** Aims for 20-30 minutes of sun exposure per day, depending on time of day and season.
*   **Benefits:** Supports vitamin D synthesis, increases nitric oxide levels, and provides fresh air and movement.
*   **Philosophy:** Less about fear of the sun and more about natural exposure and getting outside.

### Grounding (Earthing)

*   **Practice:** Spending time with bare feet on grass or earth.
*   **Mechanism:** Believed to involve absorbing electrons from the earth, which may increase the zeta potential of red blood cells, reduce blood viscosity, improve circulation, and decrease inflammation.
*   **Association:** While direct evidence for reduced all-cause mortality is lacking, it's hypothesized to reduce clotting and related issues.

### Iron and Health (Dumping Iron)

*   **Iron's Role:** Essential for life, but excess iron is problematic.
*   **Regulation:** The body has regulatory mechanisms for iron absorption, but many people have dysregulated systems leading to elevated body iron stores (ferritin).
*   **Sources of Excess Iron:** Fortified foods (flour, cornmeal), multivitamins.
*   **Association with Ill Health:** Rising ferritin levels with age are linked to increased mortality and various health issues.
*   **Jerome Sullivan's Hypothesis:** Proposed that lower heart disease rates in women pre-menopause were linked to lower iron stores.
*   **Cancer Link:** Rapidly growing tissues like cancer cells require iron; tumor cells often upregulate transferrin receptors to accumulate iron.
*   **Blood Donation Benefits:** Studies suggest blood donors have better health and lower mortality rates compared to non-donors, even after accounting for the "healthy donor effect." Regular donations beyond two per year are associated with a significant reduction in mortality.
*   **Therapeutic Phlebotomy:** The practice of drawing blood can improve metabolic syndrome and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
*   **Mechanism of Harm:** Free iron (labile iron) can cause oxidative stress and damage. Iron stored within ferritin is generally less reactive, but this system can become dysregulated (e.g., glycosylated ferritin due to high blood sugar) leading to iron leakage.
*   **Biomarker Importance:** Ferritin is a key indicator, and maintaining low-normal levels is recommended. Serum iron alone is less informative.
*   **Microbial Interaction:** Bacteria generally require iron for growth. Pathogenic bacteria compete with humans for iron, leading to an evolutionary "arms race." Critical illness or injury can release free iron, promoting microbial growth and infection. The role of microbes in iron dysregulation is an area for further investigation.

## Diet and Exercise in Aging and Longevity

### Overtraining and Longevity

*   **U-Shaped Curve:** Overtraining, like lack of exercise, can be detrimental.
*   **Exercise and Longevity:** While exercise significantly improves healthspan (quality of life), its impact on maximum lifespan is less pronounced compared to other factors like genetics or diet.
*   **Heart Health in Endurance Athletes:** Lifelong, intense endurance training can sometimes lead to cardiac scarring (late gadolinium enhancement).

### Lean Mass Hyper-Responder (LMHR) Phenotype

*   **Lipid Profile:** Individuals on very low-carb diets may exhibit high LDL cholesterol and high total cholesterol with low triglycerides and HDL.
*   **Metabolic Health Assessment:** High LDL alone does not necessarily indicate poor metabolic health. Crucial factors include:
    *   **Oxidized LDL:** Considered more atherogenic than non-oxidized LDL.
    *   **ApoB:** A marker for small, dense LDL particles, often associated with metabolic syndrome.
    *   **Glucose and HbA1c:** In LMHR individuals, it's important to monitor glucose and HbA1c. If these are elevated despite a low-carb diet, it suggests poor metabolic health or insulin resistance.
*   **Improving Metabolic Health:**
    *   **Exercise:** Appropriate amounts of resistance training are key for improving body composition (increasing muscle mass, reducing body fat).
    *   **Dietary Fat Intake:** Re-evaluating excessive dietary fat intake in low-carb diets, as it may contribute to weight management issues or potentially impact glucose/HbA1c.
    *   **Carbohydrate Introduction:** Carefully reintroducing complex carbohydrates and fiber from whole foods might improve insulin sensitivity and gut microbiome health in some individuals.
*   **Dawn Phenomenon:** Elevated fasting glucose levels in the morning can be due to the dawn phenomenon (cortisol release) and stress, rather than chronic hyperglycemia. HbA1c provides a better long-term measure.

### Hormonal Health

*   **SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin):** Often elevated in individuals on calorie restriction and regular exercisers.
*   **Testosterone:** Very low free testosterone and high SHBG can be seen in individuals with very high training volumes or potential overtraining, despite high total testosterone.

## Past Regrets and Advice

### Pre-Autodidact Era (Runner PD)

*   **Dietary Advice:** Regrets following mainstream low-fat, vegetarian/vegan advice, which he believes led to insufficient protein and potential health concerns (e.g., cardiovascular disease in family history).
*   **Smoking:** Smoked cigarettes for 15 years, which he now views as a significant regret.
*   **Running:** While enjoyable and euphoric, he no longer considers it the optimal form of exercise.

### Post-Awakening Era (HIT PD)

*   **Training Methodology:** Wishes he had adopted the High-Intensity Training approach earlier.
*   **Smoking Cessation:** Motivated by family history of heart disease and the understanding of smoking's risks. Lung function tests have since shown excellent results.
