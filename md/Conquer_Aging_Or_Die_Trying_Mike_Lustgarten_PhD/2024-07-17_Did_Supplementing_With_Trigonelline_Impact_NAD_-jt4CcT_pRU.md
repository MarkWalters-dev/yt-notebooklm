# 2024-07-17 Did Supplementing With Trigonelline Impact NAD

## Executive Summary
*   Studies in mice indicate that Trigonelline increases NAD levels in the blood, liver, and muscle.
*   A 10-day human self-experiment with 500 mg/day of supplemental Trigonelline did not increase NAD levels.
*   The NAD level measured after supplementation (17.1 micromolar) was the lowest recorded in 20 tests conducted over more than a year.
*   Future analysis of plasma Trigonelline levels from the experiment will determine if the 500 mg dose was sufficient to elevate plasma concentrations above a historical maximum of 6.9 micromolar.
*   Depending on the plasma Trigonelline levels, subsequent steps may include increasing the supplemental dose or concluding that higher Trigonelline intake does not impact NAD for this individual.

## Mouse Data
Trigonelline increases NAD in blood, liver, and muscle.

## Human Self-Experiment Protocol and Results
### Protocol
*   **Supplement:** 500 mg supplemental Trigonelline per day
*   **Duration:** 10 days
*   **Context:** This dose represented a seven-fold increase above the usual dietary intake of approximately 70 mg per day.
*   **Measurement:** Blood samples were sent to Ginfinity for NAD analysis. Blood was also sent for metabolomic analysis (ILO's kit) to measure plasma Trigonelline levels.

### Results
*   On June 28, NAD levels were 17.1 micromolar.
*   Supplemental Trigonelline did not increase NAD levels and showed no measurable impact.

## NAD Levels Comparison
The 17.1 micromolar NAD level recorded after supplementation was the lowest out of 20 tests conducted from early 2023 to 2024. This suggests that at least 500 mg of supplemental Trigonelline did not positively impact NAD levels.

## Future Considerations and Hypotheses
A key question remaining is whether plasma Trigonelline levels exceeded 7 micromolar during the supplementation period. This threshold is chosen as the highest previous dietary intake of Trigonelline resulted in plasma levels of 6.9 micromolar.

### Hypothesis Flow
*   **Measurement:** Awaiting metabolomic analysis results (ILO's kit) to measure plasma Trigonelline levels from the June 28 test.
*   **Scenario 1:** Plasma Trigonelline was **NOT** greater than 7 micromolar.
    *   **Interpretation:** 500 mg of supplemental Trigonelline was insufficient to significantly raise plasma levels.
    *   **Next Step:** Potentially increase supplemental intake to 1 gram or more per day.
*   **Scenario 2:** Plasma Trigonelline **WAS** greater than 7 micromolar.
    *   **Interpretation:** Even with elevated plasma Trigonelline, NAD levels did not increase.
    *   **Conclusion (for the individual):** This argues against a significant role for relatively higher dietary and supplemental Trigonelline intakes in impacting NAD levels for this individual. Other individuals may experience different results.
