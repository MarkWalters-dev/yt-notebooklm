# 2022-05-01 Methionine Restriction Extends Lifespan-What's Optimal For Protein Intake n=1 Analysis

## Executive Summary
*   Methionine restriction in male mice showed a 7% increase in median lifespan and a significant increase in maximal survival.
*   Methionine restriction in rats resulted in a 29% increase in median survival and a 12% increase in maximal survival.
*   Analysis of personal n=1 data suggests that higher protein intake correlates with negative health biomarkers, including higher glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), neutrophils, and lower lymphocyte percentage.
*   Conversely, higher protein intake correlates positively with lower homocysteine and potentially higher red blood cells, though the latter also shows negative correlations with other biomarkers.
*   Based on a net score of -7 (8 biomarkers in the wrong direction, 1 in the right), higher protein intake was deemed detrimental, leading to a reduction in personal protein intake.

## Methionine Restriction and Lifespan Extension

### Mouse Data
*   **Control Diet:** Contained 0.43% methionine.
*   **Methionine Restricted Diet:** Contained 65% less dietary methionine (0.15%).
*   **Study Start:** Methionine restriction began at 12 weeks of age.
*   **Median Survival:** Controls lived 948 days; methionine-restricted mice showed a 7% increase.
*   **Maximal Survival:** Defined as the age when 10% of the colony remained.
    *   Controls: Approximately 2 mice left at 1175 days.
    *   Methionine Restricted: Significantly more mice (7-8) still alive at the same age.

### Rat Data
*   **Control Diet:** Contained 0.86% methionine.
*   **Methionine Restricted Diet:** Contained 80% less methionine (0.17%).
*   **Study Start:** Methionine restriction began at 42 days of age.
*   **Median Survival:** Controls lived 818 days; methionine-restricted rats showed a 29% increase.
*   **Maximal Survival:** Increased by 12% in the methionine-restricted group.

## Personal n=1 Analysis: Protein Intake and Health Biomarkers

### Methodology
*   **Data Collection:** Daily food weighing using a food scale, with amounts entered into a nutrition tracking app (e.g., Cronometer).
*   **Timeframe:** April 2015 - April 2022 (7 years).
*   **Protein Intake Tracking:** Daily protein intake logged into an Excel spreadsheet.
*   **Protein Intake Range:** As low as 78 grams/day, as high as 148 grams/day.
*   **Average Protein Intake (7 years):** Approximately 114 grams/day.
*   **Recent Trend (since early 2019):** Consistent reduction in protein intake.
*   **Most Recent Intake (Test #2, 2022):** Averaged 103 grams/day.
*   **Blood Biomarker Analysis:** Up to 36 blood tests for blood biomarkers collected over the same 7-year span.
*   **Correlation Analysis:** Examining the correlation between dietary protein intake and "big picture" blood biomarkers.

### Correlation of Protein Intake with Big Picture Biomarkers

*   **Methodology for Interpretation:**
    *   If significantly correlated with more biomarkers going in the wrong direction: Reduce protein intake.
    *   If significantly correlated with an equal number of biomarkers going in the right and wrong direction: Aim for average protein intake (114g/day).
    *   If significantly correlated with more biomarkers going in the right direction: Increase protein intake.

*   **Biomarker Correlations:**

    *   **Glucose:**
        *   Higher protein intake correlated with higher glucose.
        *   Glucose increases during aging.
        *   **Arrow:** Red (Wrong direction)

    *   **Homocysteine:**
        *   Higher protein intake correlated with lower homocysteine.
        *   Homocysteine increases during aging.
        *   **Arrow:** Green (Right direction - lower levels are found in youth)

    *   **Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN):**
        *   Higher protein intake correlated with higher BUN.
        *   BUN increases during aging.
        *   **Arrow:** Red (Wrong direction)

    *   **LDL Cholesterol:**
        *   Higher protein intake correlated with higher LDL.
        *   LDL increases during aging.
        *   **Side Analysis (LDL vs. other biomarkers):** LDL showed significant correlations with 5 biomarkers in the wrong direction and 1 in the right, suggesting lower LDL might be optimal.
        *   **Arrow:** Red (Potentially wrong direction)

    *   **Neutrophils:**
        *   Higher protein intake correlated with higher neutrophils.
        *   Neutrophils increase during aging.
        *   **Arrow:** Red (Wrong direction)

    *   **Lymphocyte Percentage:**
        *   Higher protein intake correlated with lower lymphocyte percentage.
        *   Lymphocyte percentage declines during aging.
        *   **Arrow:** Red (Wrong direction - lower levels are found in the aged)

    *   **Platelets:**
        *   Higher protein intake correlated with higher platelets.
        *   Platelets decline during aging (U-shaped curve for mortality risk).
        *   **Side Analysis (Platelets vs. other biomarkers):** Higher platelets correlated with 4 biomarkers in the wrong direction and 1 in the right, suggesting lower platelets might be optimal.
        *   **Arrow:** Red (Potentially wrong direction)

    *   **Red Blood Cells (RBC):**
        *   Higher protein intake correlated with higher RBC.
        *   RBC decline during aging.
        *   **Side Analysis (RBC vs. other biomarkers):** Higher RBC correlated with 7 biomarkers in the wrong direction and 2 in the right, suggesting higher RBC might not be good.
        *   **Arrow:** Red (Potentially wrong direction)

### Summary of Protein Intake Correlations

*   **Total Significant Correlations:** 8 biomarkers in the wrong direction, 1 in the right direction.
*   **Net Score:** -7.
*   **Conclusion:** Higher protein intake is significantly correlated with more biomarkers going in the wrong direction than the right.

### Personal Action Based on Findings
*   Due to the net score of -7, protein intake has been reduced relative to the average.
*   This is one reason for the observed reduction in protein intake over the past three years.
*   **Current Adjustment:** Reduced intake to 103 grams/day (Test #2, 2022), and further to 99 grams/day for the next test.
*   **Future Goal:** Exploring if a daily protein intake between 78 and 103 grams per day is optimal, while balancing muscle mass considerations.
