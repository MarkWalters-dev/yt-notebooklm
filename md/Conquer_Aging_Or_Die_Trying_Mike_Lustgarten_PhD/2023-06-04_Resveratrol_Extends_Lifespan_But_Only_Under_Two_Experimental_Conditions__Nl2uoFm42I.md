# 2023-06-04 Resveratrol Extends Lifespan But Only Under Two Experimental Conditions

## Executive Summary
* Resveratrol extended median and average lifespan in male Little (dwarf) mice only when they were fed a **high-calorie, obesogenic diet (60% fat)**.
* Lifespan extension on the obesogenic diet was **not greater** than the lifespan observed in mice fed a standard, non-obesogenic diet.
* Resveratrol **did not extend lifespan** in mice fed a standard, non-obesogenic diet across five tested doses (100, 300, 400, 1200, and 2400 mg/kg food).
* A second condition for lifespan extension was observed when mice were fed the standard diet on an **Every Other Day (EOD) schedule with low-dose resveratrol (100 mg/kg food)**, but not at the higher dose (400 mg/kg food).
* The maximal lifespan benefit achieved under the obesogenic diet condition did not exceed the lifespan of the standard diet control groups.

## Mouse Data: Resveratrol on Obesogenic Diet (Diet-Induced Obesity Model)

Mice were initiated on treatment at one year of age. Data presented is for male mice only.

### Diet Conditions and Body Weight Impact
1.  **Standard Diet (SD):** 7% fat, purified diet (contained cornstarch, casein, maltodextrin, sucrose, soybean oil, cellulose).
    *   Body weight remained constant (approx. 35 grams/mouse).
2.  **High Calorie Diet (HCD):** 60% fat (obesogenic).
    *   Body weight increased by approximately 40% and was sustained throughout the study for both HCD and HCD + Resveratrol groups.

### Median Survival (0.5 Proportion Surviving)
*   **HCD (No Resveratrol):** Median survival was approximately 108 weeks.
*   **SD:** Mice on the standard diet lived significantly longer than the HCD group.
*   **HCD + 0.04% Resveratrol (400 mg/kg food):** Median survival was significantly increased (20% more mice alive at 108 weeks compared to HCD controls), demonstrating lifespan extension in diet-induced obesity.

### Full Lifespan Data (Published 2008)
Mice were fed one of four diets starting at one year of age:
*   Standard Diet (SD)
*   High Calorie Control (HCD)
*   High Calorie Low Resveratrol (HCLR): 100 mg/kg food
*   High Calorie Resveratrol (HCR): 400 mg/kg food

**Average Lifespan Results:**
*   **SD:** Average lifespan indicated at approximately 118 weeks.
*   **HCD:** Average lifespan was significantly shorter at 102 weeks.
*   **HCLR (100 mg/kg):** Average lifespan increased significantly to 115 weeks compared to HCD.
*   **HCR (400 mg/kg):** Average lifespan also extended when compared with the HCD group.

**Maximal Lifespan Results (0.2 Survival):**
*   **HCD** showed significantly reduced maximal lifespan compared to **SD**.
*   **HCLR (100 mg/kg):** Showed a significant increase in maximal lifespan compared to HCD controls.
*   **HCR (400 mg/kg):** Did not show a statistically significant increase in maximal lifespan compared to HCD controls, although the survival curve shifted rightward.
*   **Conclusion for Obesogenic Diet:** Lifespan increased under HCD, but maximal lifespan reached approximately the level of mice on the standard diet (SD).

## Resveratrol on Non-Obesogenic Diet (Standard Diet)

Studies investigated the effect of resveratrol on mice fed a standard, non-obesogenic diet (purified or whole-food based). Treatment started at one year of age.

### Purified Standard Diet (No Resveratrol vs. Doses up to 400 mg/kg)
**Median Survival:**
*   **SD (Control):** Average lifespan $\approx$ 118 weeks.
*   **Low Resveratrol (LR, 100 mg/kg):** Median/average survival was essentially overlapping with the SD control.
*   **Higher Resveratrol (400 mg/kg):** A 2.3-week increase in average lifespan was observed, but this difference was **not statistically significant** compared to SD controls.

**Maximal Survival (0.2 Survival):**
*   Both low and higher dose resveratrol groups showed virtually overlapping curves when compared with the SD control, indicating **no effect on maximal survival**.

### Purified Standard Diet (Very High Dose: 2400 mg/kg)
*   **Median Survival:** The very high dose virtually overlapped with the standard diet control curve, showing **no significant difference**.
*   **Maximal Survival (0.2 Survival):** The high-dose group also showed virtually overlapping curves with the standard diet controls, indicating **no effect**.
*   **Summary:** Five doses tested (100, 300, 400, 1200, and 2400 mg/kg food) on a standard, non-obesogenic diet (purified or whole food based) showed **no significant extension of lifespan** in male or female mice.

## Resveratrol on Every Other Day (EOD) Feeding Schedule

The second condition where resveratrol extended lifespan involved a modified feeding protocol using the purified standard diet (7% fat).

**Protocol:**
*   **Day 1:** Free access to food.
*   **Day 2:** Food removed; resveratrol supplemented (if applicable).
*   Treatment initiated at one year of age (male mice only).

**Dose Groups:**
*   Standard Diet Control (EOD without R)
*   EOD + 100 mg/kg Resveratrol (Low Dose)
*   EOD + 400 mg/kg Resveratrol (High Dose)

### Average Lifespan Results
*   **EOD Control (No R):** Average lifespan showed a small rightward shift compared to continuous feeding controls ($\approx$ 118 weeks), but this was **not statistically significant**.
*   **EOD + 100 mg/kg R (Low Dose):** Showed a **significant increase in average lifespan** when compared with EOD feeding without resveratrol.
*   **EOD + 400 mg/kg R (High Dose):** Survival curves completely overlapped with the EOD control group, showing **no significant effect**.

### Maximal Survival Results (0.1 Survival)
*   **EOD Control (No R):** Did not impact maximal survival compared to standard continuous feeding.
*   **EOD + 100 mg/kg R (Low Dose):** Showed a **significantly increased maximal survival** compared to EOD controls without resveratrol.
*   **EOD + 400 mg/kg R (High Dose):** Did not increase maximal lifespan compared to EOD controls without resveratrol.
*   **Conclusion for EOD:** Resveratrol extended lifespan only at the lowest dose (100 mg/kg food) when administered under an Every Other Day feeding regimen.
