# 2022-12-08 American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine A4M Conference Presentation

## Executive Summary

*   The speaker consistently achieved a biological age significantly younger than his chronological age using both blood-based (Levine's Phenotypic Age, aging.ai) and some epigenetic (Hannum, Dunedin PACE) clocks, with reductions of 15-18 years below chronological age.
*   Personalized diet tracking, involving daily weighing of all food and correlation analysis of macro/micronutrient intake with a comprehensive panel of 20+ blood biomarkers, is used to guide dietary adjustments. This data-driven approach often leads to intake levels far exceeding or falling below standard RDAs for optimal biomarker ranges.
*   Cardiovascular fitness metrics (Resting Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability) showed consistent improvements, with resting heart rate decreasing year-over-year and heart rate variability increasing relative to baseline. These improvements were strongly correlated with body weight reduction and a strategic 3-4 day workout-to-rest cycle.
*   The speaker identified relatively low DHEA sulfate levels as a potential weakness, exploring its link to dietary cholesterol and adrenal function. An attempt to increase dietary cholesterol did not significantly raise blood cholesterol or DHEA sulfate, indicating a need for alternative interventions.
*   Initial oral microbiome analysis revealed the absence of cavity-forming bacteria and high levels of oral health-promoting bacteria, likely due to a homemade mouthwash containing xylitol, sodium bicarbonate, and peppermint oil. However, high nitrate intake (dietary and supplemental) did not further increase nitrate-reducing bacteria, suggesting maximization through diet.

## Blood-Based Biological Clocks

### Levine's Phenotypic Age

The speaker's biological age, calculated using Dr. Morgan Levine's phenotypic age calculator (which incorporates nine blood test variables and chronological age), was 34 years in August 2022, 15.6 years younger than his chronological age. Across 20 blood tests from 2018-2022, his average biological age consistently remained significantly lower than his chronological age. In 2022, the average was 33.9 years, a 1.7-year reduction compared to 2020-2021. The difference between chronological and biological age increased from an average of 12 years prior to 2022, to over 15 years in 2022, reaching a maximum disparity of 17.2 years.

Levine's test exhibits strong correlations with chronological age (R=0.94 and 0.96 in NHANES III and NHANES IV studies with ~10,000-11,000 participants), comparable to the best epigenetic clocks like Horvath.

Beyond chronological age, Levine's test is associated with all-cause mortality risk. A study of ~11,000 people showed that for every one-year increase in biological age, all-cause mortality risk increases by 9%. This association was consistent across young, middle-aged, and older groups. Increased biological age was also linked to higher mortality risk from heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease, and kidney-related issues, but not cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, influenza, or pneumonia. Additionally, an older Levine's biological age was associated with increased COVID-19 mortality risk up to 15 years before the pandemic.

### aging.ai

The aging.ai calculator, which uses 19 input biomarkers from standard chemistry panels and CBC (costing less than $80 USD when combined with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein for Levine's test), offers another free and practical assessment. Its correlation with chronological age is R=0.8, without including chronological age in its model.

Studies show aging.ai's biological age is also associated with all-cause mortality risk:
*   In a Canadian cohort, biological ages >5 years older than chronological age showed a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk. Conversely, biological ages >5 years younger than chronological age showed a significantly reduced risk.
*   Similar trends were observed in a US NHANES cohort.

The speaker's data across 35 blood tests from 2009-2022 shows his aging.ai biological age consistently falling within the 29-32 year range, regardless of his chronological age (ranging from early thirties to approaching 50). His predicted age from a recent test was 31 years, 18.6 years younger than his chronological age.

## Epigenetic Testing

### Horvath Clock (Intrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration - IEAA)

The Horvath clock measures cell-intrinsic aging. It is strongly correlated with chronological age (R=0.94 in multi-tissue studies and R=0.85 for the Horvath 2 iteration). A meta-analysis of 13 studies (~13,000 people) found it significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk, showing a relatively small but significant 1.4% increase in risk for older Horvath ages.

The speaker's Horvath epigenetic age was 59 years in May 2022 and 53.5 years in July 2022, both 4-6 years *older* than his chronological age. This contrasts with centenarian offspring who exhibit lower IEAA compared to age-matched controls, suggesting a potential lack of strong longevity genes in the speaker's family history.

### Hannum Clock (Extrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration - EEAA)

The Hannum clock is considered a marker of immune system aging. It is significantly correlated with chronological age (R=0.68). The same meta-analysis of 13 studies showed that a relatively older Hannum epigenetic age is significantly associated with a 2.9% increased all-cause mortality risk.

The speaker's Hannum epigenetic age was 36.87 years in the first test and consistently 12 years younger than his chronological age in subsequent tests. This clock adjusts for immune cell parameters including B cells, CD4 and CD8 T cells, NK cells, and white blood cell differentials (lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils), as well as the CD4 to CD8 ratio.

### Dunedin PACE Epigenetic Test

The Dunedin PACE (Pace of Aging Calculated from the Epigenome) test, though weakly correlated with chronological age (R=0.32), is notable for its strong association with all-cause mortality risk and its unique ability to detect biological age reduction from calorie restriction (CR) in human studies.

*   **Association with All-Cause Mortality:** In a study of men (~771 participants), Dunedin PACE and an older iteration (Dunedin POAM) were as strongly associated with all-cause mortality risk as other established clocks like PhenoAge and GrimAge, while Horvath and Hannum were not significantly associated in this specific study. Similar findings were seen in the Framingham offspring study.
*   **Detection of CR-Induced Age Reduction:** A two-year randomized controlled trial on calorie restriction (average 12% reduction) showed that Dunedin PACE was the only epigenetic clock that detected a lower epigenetic age (slower aging rate) in the CR group at 12 and 24 months, compared to ad libitum eaters. Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, and GrimAge clocks did not show a significant difference between CR and ad libitum groups.

The speaker's Dunedin PACE value was 0.8 in the first test and 0.82 in the second. This means for every chronological year, his epigenetic age increases by 0.8-0.82 years, which is slower than the fastest rate (1.4) but not as slow as the slowest recorded rate (0.6).

**Summary of Speaker's Epigenetic Age Clocks:**
*   **Horvath:** Relatively older epigenetic age, possibly due to longevity genes or factors not yet identified.
*   **Hannum:** Relatively youthful immune cell aging, indicated by a lower epigenetic age.
*   **Dunedin PACE:** Relatively slow epigenetic aging rate.

The speaker emphasizes that while epigenetic clocks are cutting-edge, their precise measurement of aging hallmarks is still under discovery. He focuses heavily on blood-based biomarkers due to their extensive historical research and established malleability to intervention.

## Lifestyle Factors Impacting Biological Age

### Supplements

The speaker's supplement regimen is minimal:
*   **Levothyroxine:** Prescribed for hypothyroidism since his mid-twenties.
*   **Melatonin:** Occasionally taken in small microgram doses (100-200 mcg) for a few nights (e.g., 3 nights in a 42-day period).
*   **Vitamin D:** Only in winter months due to northern latitude; not taken in summer due to sufficient sun exposure.
*   **No Geroprotectors or Senolytics:** These are not currently used.

### Diet Tracking Methodology

1.  **Daily Food Weighing:** All food is weighed prior to intake, every day since 2015.
2.  **Online Tracking Tool:** Food amounts are entered into Cronometer (or similar apps).
3.  **Data Entry:** Daily Cronometer data is transferred to a spreadsheet.
4.  **Average Intake Calculation:** Average daily intake (individual food amounts, macro/micronutrients) for the period between blood tests is calculated.
5.  **Correlation Analysis:** With sufficient blood tests and corresponding dietary compositions, correlations between diet and blood biomarkers are calculated.
6.  **Dietary Alteration:** Based on these correlations, dietary intake is adjusted to optimize blood biomarkers, aiming for ranges associated with optimal aging and reduced all-cause mortality risk (determined through extensive literature review).

### Individual Food Amounts & Homocysteine Example

*   **Berry Intake:** An unintentional shift from high strawberry intake to a mix of blackberries and blueberries occurred due to availability.
*   **Sardine Intake:** Increased intentionally (e.g., from 99g/day to 115g/day). The primary goal was to reduce homocysteine, as B12 (largely from sardines) was inversely correlated with homocysteine levels in the speaker's data.

**Homocysteine and B12:**
Homocysteine levels increase with aging (e.g., from ~7 µmol/L in youth to ~12 µmol/L in those over 80, and ~23 µmol/L in centenarians). Hyperhomocysteinemia (>15 µmol/L) is linked to adverse health in multiple organ systems.

The speaker's data shows a significant inverse correlation between B12 intake and homocysteine levels: higher B12 intake led to lower homocysteine. However, high B12 intake (especially from supplementation) was also significantly correlated with multiple "big picture" biomarkers moving in the wrong direction (e.g., higher glucose, BUN, alkaline phosphatase, neutrophils, monocytes, lower percentage lymphocytes). This led to a negative net correlative score (-8), suggesting that high B12 supplementation might be detrimental overall despite lowering homocysteine.

*   **Dates Intake:** A higher date intake was significantly correlated with lower homocysteine in the speaker's data. However, dates also had a net negative correlative score (-4) with big picture biomarkers, suggesting a need to stay below his average intake. An experiment to reduce homocysteine by increasing dates while reducing B12 supplementation successfully lowered homocysteine.

**"Cheat Meals" Strategy:**
To manage occasional consumption of "junk food," the speaker consumes it on the day of or the day after a blood test, then abstains completely until the next test (e.g., no junk for 40 days between tests).

### Macro and Micronutrient Composition

The speaker determines optimal macronutrient and micronutrient intake based on net correlative scores with a panel of "big picture biomarkers" (glucose, homocysteine, kidney/liver function markers, lipoproteins, immune cells, RDW, biological age scores). A positive net score suggests eating *above* average intake, a zero score suggests aiming for average, and a negative score suggests eating *below* average.

*   **Calories:** Net score of -5 (correlated with higher alkaline phosphatase, AST, LDL, platelets, RDW). Speaker eats below his 2015 average of 2550 kcal/day (e.g., ~2294 kcal/day).
*   **Protein:** Net score of -8 (correlated with higher glucose, BUN, alkaline phosphatase, AST, LDL, neutrophils, monocytes, lower percentage lymphocytes). Speaker eats below his 2015 average of 112.5g/day (e.g., ~97g/day).
*   **Total Fat:** Net score of -7. Speaker eats below his 2015 average of 86g/day (e.g., ~83g/day).
    *   **Monounsaturated Fat:** Net score of -3. Speaker eats below his 2015 average.
    *   **Omega-3:** Net score of +3. Speaker eats above his 2015 average.
    *   **Omega-6:** Net score of +3. Speaker eats above his 2015 average.
    *   **Saturated Fat:** Net score of -6. Speaker eats below his 2015 average (e.g., ~23g/day vs 27g/day). Dairy-derived saturated fat appears to be a major driver of negative correlations.
*   **Total Cholesterol (Dietary):** Net score of -8. Speaker eats below his 2015 average of 126 mg/day (e.g., ~24 mg/day).
*   **Net Carbohydrates:** Net score of +1. Speaker eats above his 2015 average of 234g/day.
*   **Fiber:** Net score of +1. Speaker aims for above average but acknowledges a slight shortfall (e.g., 91g/day vs 97g/day average).
*   **Fructose:** Net score of -3. Speaker eats below his 2015 average of 85g/day (e.g., ~65g/day).

**Micronutrients:**
*   **Niacin:** Net score of +7. Speaker consumes ~42mg/day, well above the RDA (16mg/day), which correlates positively with several biomarkers.
*   **Beta Carotene:** Net score of -9. Despite positive correlation with albumin, it correlates negatively with nine other biomarkers. Speaker consumes below his average intake (e.g., ~50mg/day vs 54mg/day average).
*   **Vitamin D:** Speaker's intake (~300 IU/day) is below the RDA but his blood levels are optimal (~64 ng/mL) due to regular sun exposure in summer.
*   **Vitamin K:** Net score of +2. Speaker consumes ~1955 µg/day, 16 times higher than the AI (120 µg/day), showing a net positive correlative score.
*   **Copper:** Net score of +3. Speaker consumes ~4.7mg/day, five times higher than the RDA (0.9mg/day), showing a net positive correlative score.
*   **Magnesium:** Net score of 0. Speaker consumes ~700mg/day, which is above the RDA but slightly below his 800mg/day average.

## Cardiovascular Fitness Metrics

The speaker emphasizes tracking additional organ systems beyond those on biological age tests (e.g., musculoskeletal, pulmonary, brain, cardiovascular) to avoid blind spots in health optimization.

### Resting Heart Rate (RHR)

*   **Age-Related Changes:** WHOOP data shows RHR increases from 20-50 years, then Fitbit data suggests it decreases after age 50. Thus, a low RHR can be found in both youth and advanced age.
*   **Speaker's Data:** Across 1500 days of data (2018-2022), the speaker consistently reduced his RHR year-over-year. Starting at ~51 bpm in 2018, it decreased to ~45 bpm in 2022, resisting the age-related increase observed up to age 50.

### Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

*   **Definition:** Variability in the time between heartbeats (RMSSD measure). HRV declines significantly with aging (e.g., from ~75-80 ms in 20-year-olds to <40 ms in 60-year-olds).
*   **Longevity Marker:** Studies suggest that people older than 80 and centenarians can have higher-than-expected HRV for their chronological age, potentially indicating a marker of longevity.
*   **Speaker's Data:** Starting at 47 ms in 2018, his HRV increased to ~56-57 ms in 2019-2020, regressed to ~52 ms in 2021, and then increased to ~59.4 ms in 2022. While not a consistent year-over-year increase, it is significantly higher than his starting point in 2018 and above his chronologically expected HRV of ~35 ms.

**Interpreting RHR and HRV:**
A low RHR combined with a high HRV (as seen in the speaker's data) suggests cardiovascular youth. In contrast, a low RHR with low HRV would be indicative of advanced age.

**Factors Contributing to CV Improvements:**

1.  **Body Weight:**
    *   The speaker reduced his body weight from ~159 lbs to ~151-152 lbs over the tracking period.
    *   Decreased body weight was significantly correlated with decreased RHR and increased HRV, both approaching youthful values.

2.  **Physical Activity (Average Daily Heart Rate - ADHR):**
    *   ADHR serves as an index of overall physical activity and stress.
    *   Higher ADHR for the day before was significantly correlated with a higher next-day RHR and lower next-morning HRV.
    *   **Workout Strategy:** The speaker implements a 3-4 day workout cycle. This involves an intense 80-minute workout followed by 3 days of relatively low activity levels (not sedentary), allowing for recovery and optimization of RHR and HRV.

## Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement

### DHEA Sulfate

The speaker identified relatively low DHEA sulfate levels (e.g., 129 µg/dL in August 2022) as a potential weakness. DHEA sulfate is the most abundant circulating steroid, peaking around age 20 and declining thereafter. The speaker's levels are low for his age group and even for some older age groups. Levels below 129 µg/dL are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk in 27-year follow-up studies. Finger-prick home blood tests across 12 measurements confirmed an average DHEA sulfate level of ~120 µg/dL.

**Metabolic Pathway of DHEA Sulfate Synthesis:**

Cholesterol -> Pregnenolone -> 17-Hydroxypregnenolone -> DHEA -> DHEA Sulfate

(Enzymatic reactions occur primarily in the adrenal gland)

The speaker hypothesized that his low DHEA sulfate might be linked to his very low dietary and blood total cholesterol levels. If true, cortisol and testosterone (also derived from cholesterol) might also be low.
*   **Cortisol:** Speaker's cortisol levels were midpoint, with a slight decline from earlier data.
*   **Testosterone:** Speaker's testosterone levels were not low but were lower than in his youth, suggesting potential age-related changes in adrenal function.

An attempt to increase dietary cholesterol to raise DHEA sulfate was made. While dietary cholesterol was the most strongly correlated nutrient with blood cholesterol in his personal data, increasing his intake (e.g., from 24 mg/day to 92 mg/day) did not result in an increase in his blood total cholesterol or DHEA sulfate levels. This suggests dietary cholesterol may not be the causative factor in his case, requiring alternative approaches to increase DHEA sulfate.

### Oral Microbiome

Oral bacteria have been linked to various adverse health conditions, both locally (cavity formation, periodontal disease) and systemically (atherosclerotic plaques, pneumonia, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune conditions). Since oral health is not captured by blood biomarkers, tracking the oral microbiome is included in the speaker's approach.

**Speaker's Initial Oral Microbiome Analysis (Bristle):**
*   **Oral Health-Promoting Bacteria:** Neisseria and Rothia comprised ~53% of his total oral bacteria.
*   **Cavity-Forming Bacteria:** No *Streptococcus mutans* or other cavity-forming bacteria were detected. This is attributed to a homemade mouthwash.

**Homemade Mouthwash Composition and Efficacy:**
*   **Xylitol:** 1 gram per 100 ml of water (1% concentration). Studies show 1% xylitol inhibits *Streptococcus mutans* growth by 61-76%.
*   **Sodium Bicarbonate:** 1 gram per 100 ml of water. This base helps limit oral pH drops below 5.5 (the critical pH for enamel demineralization) after sugar consumption, promoting rapid recovery to physiological pH.
*   **Peppermint Oil:** A few drops per 1000 ml. *In vitro* studies show it inhibits *P. gingivalis* growth. The speaker's *P. gingivalis* levels were initially low (0.2%) and were eliminated in a subsequent test after increasing peppermint oil.

**Areas for Improvement in Oral Microbiome:**
*   Some bacteria linked with adverse oral and/or systemic health (e.g., *Treponema*, *Tannerella*) were present at >0.2% abundance.
*   **Nitrate as a Prebiotic:** Nitrate-rich foods increase oral nitrate levels, which are consumed by nitrate-reducing bacteria (like *Neisseria* and *Rothia*), promoting their growth. Increased plasma nitrate from diet also concentrates in salivary glands and is secreted into the mouth.
    *   *Mechanism:*
        Dietary Nitrate -> Oral Cavity (Nitrate) -> Nitrate Reducing Bacteria Growth (*Neisseria*, *Rothia*)
        Dietary Nitrate -> Plasma Nitrate -> Parotid & Salivary Glands -> Oral Cavity (Nitrate) -> Nitrate Reducing Bacteria Growth (*Neisseria*, *Rothia*)
    *   An *in vitro* study showed nitrate incubation increased *Neisseria* and *Rothia* and reduced caries/halitosis-related bacteria.
*   **Speaker's Nitrate Intake:** He consumes a high-nitrate diet (e.g., ~1900 mg/day vs. an acceptable daily intake of ~256 mg/day), which is 7-8 times higher than recommended.
*   **Mouthwash Experiment with Potassium Nitrate:** Despite adding potassium nitrate (64 millimolar, 10x higher than *in vitro* study) to his mouthwash and using it frequently, his nitrate-reducing bacteria levels did not increase further; they actually slightly decreased (from 53% to 46%). This suggests his high dietary nitrate may have already maximized these beneficial bacteria. He was able to eliminate *P. gingivalis* and reduce gum inflammation-related bacteria, but halitosis-related bacteria (5-5.5% of total oral bacteria) remained a work in progress. Further experiments with lower nitrate concentrations in the mouthwash are planned, as super-physiological doses might be counterproductive.
