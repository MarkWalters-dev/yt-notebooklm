# 2025-04-25 Dave Pascoe Presents His Blood Test Results - Thyroid Biomarkers

## Executive Summary

*   Dave was initially prescribed a very high T4 (levothyroxine) dose (estimated at 250 mcg), leading to Free T4 values as high as 6.
*   His Free T3 (liothyronine) levels were consistently low (2.3-2.5) for a period, despite high T4, indicating a T4 to T3 conversion issue.
*   Current medication protocol involves T4 (137 mcg) and T3 (25 mcg) daily, with consideration for split T3 dosing to better mimic physiological circadian rhythms.
*   Dave did not experience typical hypothyroid symptoms but observed vanity-related changes (under-eye bags, thinning hairline) when discontinuing medication.
*   Testing frequency was limited by his endocrinologist to every six months, despite T3's rapid fluctuations in blood, leading to challenges in dose titration.

## Thyroid Medication History

*   Dave has been on thyroid supplementation for over 30 years.
*   Initially prescribed a very high dose of T4 (levothyroxine), estimated at 250 micrograms (mcg).
*   An endocrinologist later initiated a gradual decrease in T4 dosage over several months.
*   T3 (liothyronine) was subsequently added to the regimen due to poor T4 to T3 conversion.

## Thyroid Biomarkers

### Free T4 (Thyroxine)
*   **Initial levels:** Values were observed as high as 6.
*   **Current target:** Aiming for values around 0.8 or lower, potentially below 0.75.
*   **General trend:** Free T4 levels increase during aging. Lower levels are generally associated with a lower all-cause mortality risk.

### Free T3 (Triiodothyronine)
*   **Past levels (Dave):** Consistently low, ranging from 2.3 to 2.5, for multiple tests.
*   **Past levels (Speaker):** Data consistently below the typical reference range (e.g., lowest 2.5).
*   **General trend:** Declines occur during aging. Lower levels are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Observation:** Both Dave and the speaker experienced periods of very low Free T3.

### Free T3 to Free T4 Ratio
*   The ratio has been progressively moving in the right direction over time.
*   Historically, doctors or endocrinologists primarily tested TSH and Free T4, often omitting Free T3 measurements.
*   The speaker's personal data for this ratio was collected independently due to a lack of comprehensive testing by practitioners.

## Medication Adjustments and Current Protocol

### Dave's Protocol Progression
*   **Initial:** 250 mcg T4.
*   **Transition:** Gradual decrease in T4 dose over several months.
*   **Introduction of T3:** Added due to poor conversion.
*   **Current:**
    *   T4: 137 mcg (once daily).
    *   T3 (Cytomel/liothyronine): 25 mcg (once daily).
    *   Consideration for a split T3 dose in the future.

### Speaker's T3 Dosing Strategy
*   T3 has a shorter half-life than T4.
*   The speaker takes T3 twice per day, despite a doctor's recommendation for three times daily.
*   **Dosing Schedule:**
    *   Morning (around 9 AM): T3 (with T4).
    *   Before bed: 10 mcg T3 (Cytomel).
*   **Rationale:** To mimic the normal circadian rhythm of T3, which peaks around 2-4 AM and 9 AM. This aims to achieve a more physiological T3 profile throughout the day and night.

## Impact of Testing Schedule on Results

*   **Past Inconsistency:** Blood tests were sometimes taken before morning medication, and other times after, leading to variable results.
*   **Endocrinologist's Approach:** Limited testing to every six months, based on the belief that markers do not change quickly.
*   **Counter-argument:** T3 levels can rise rapidly in the blood after administration, suggesting more frequent testing is beneficial for dose titration.
*   **Dave's Current Testing Strategy:**
    *   First attempted 2 hours after medication.
    *   Then 4 hours after medication.
    *   Currently aiming for 6 hours after medication.
    *   Also tested completely fasted without morning medication, showing very low levels, but this doesn't assess medication efficacy.
*   **Optimal Testing Strategy Discussion:** Testing completely fasted, without morning medication, particularly with a split T3 dose (where an evening dose provides some residual T3), could be valuable to assess baseline and drug absorption.

## Symptom Experience

### Dave's Experience
*   Never knew he had a thyroid issue; experienced no typical hypothyroid symptoms (e.g., tiredness, weight gain, low libido).
*   Only noticeable physical symptoms were occasionally cold nose, fingers, and toes.
*   **Experiment:** Went off all thyroid medication for about a month.
    *   No immediate subjective feeling of difference.
    *   Observed bags under eyes and thinning hairline (vanity-related symptoms) after a month, which prompted him to resume medication.
    *   After Free T3/T4 levels increased, the occurrence of cold nose, fingers, and toes decreased.

### Speaker's Experience
*   Struggles with hypothyroidism, experiencing:
    *   Persistent tiredness despite good sleep.
    *   Consistently cold fingers, toes, and nose.
*   **Experiment:** Stopped all thyroid medication.
    *   TSH levels increased significantly.
    *   Felt even more tired than before.
