# 2023-05-21 Kynurenine Tryptophan Ratio - More Insight Into The De Novo NAD Synthesis Pathway

## Executive Summary

*   The kynurenine to tryptophan ratio (KTR) increases with age and is associated with increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   A KTR between 15 and 23 is associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk.
*   A KTR greater than 26 is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), a form of vitamin B6, may be a limiting factor in the de novo NAD synthesis pathway, potentially impacting the conversion of tryptophan to NAD.
*   The speaker's current KTR of 23.4 places them in a range associated with either a small risk reduction or no significant association with all-cause mortality, prompting an investigation into increasing vitamin B6 intake.

## Introduction to the De Novo NAD Synthesis Pathway

Tryptophan is converted into Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) through the de novo NAD synthesis pathway. An age-related decline in vitamin B6, specifically pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), may limit this conversion. To gain insight into increasing intracellular NAD levels and potentially reversing age-related decline, measuring NAD, vitamin B6, tryptophan, and kynurenine is important.

## Metabolomic Analysis and Kynurenine-Tryptophan Ratio (KTR)

*   **Kynurenine and Tryptophan Measurement:** At-home metabolomics with IOLO provided data for kynurenine and tryptophan, along with over 500 other metabolites.
*   **KTR Significance:** The kynurenine to tryptophan ratio increases during aging and is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.

## Human Evidence: KTR and All-Cause Mortality

*   **Study Design:** A study of approximately 1,000 individuals provided blood samples at baseline (median age 59) and again 11 years later. KTR was calculated from these samples.
*   **Observed Trend:** A significant increase in the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio was observed during aging.
*   **Mortality Association:**
    *   The lowest all-cause mortality risk was associated with a KTR of 15 to 23.
    *   A statistically significant association with reduced mortality was observed when the KTR was between 15 and 23, indicated by the shaded region being completely below a hazard ratio of one.
    *   An increased all-cause mortality risk was observed when the KTR was greater than 26, indicated by the shaded region being completely above a hazard ratio of one.

## Speaker's Personal KTR Data and Implications

*   **Speaker's Metabolomic Results:**
    *   Kynurenine: 0.74 micromolar
    *   Tryptophan: 31.57 micromolar
*   **Speaker's Calculated KTR:** 23.4 nanomolar per micromolar.
*   **Interpretation:** This KTR places the speaker at best in the range of a small but significant decrease in all-cause mortality risk, and at worst, no association. The speaker aims to improve this by reducing their KTR towards the range associated with the lowest mortality risk.

## Future Intervention and Testing

*   **Hypothesis:** Increasing vitamin B6 intake may reduce the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio, thereby potentially increasing NAD levels.
*   **Current Vitamin B6 Intake:** Approximately 35 milligrams per day (three times higher than at the last NAD test).
*   **Planned Intervention:** Further increase vitamin B6 intake.
*   **Future Testing:** Blood samples will be tested in a couple of weeks, with data anticipated in June to assess the impact on KTR and NAD.
