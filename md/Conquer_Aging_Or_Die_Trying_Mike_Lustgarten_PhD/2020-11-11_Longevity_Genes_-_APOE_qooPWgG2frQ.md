# 2020-11-11 Longevity Genes - APOE

## Executive Summary
*   APOE2 genotype is associated with increased human longevity, with carriers living approximately 5-6 years longer on average than APOE4 carriers.
*   This association of APOE2 with longevity (and APOE4 with reduced lifespan) is independent of Alzheimer's disease (AD) status.
*   APOE4 carriers face significantly increased risks for both dementia-associated mortality (up to 6.49-fold for two E4 alleles) and all-cause mortality (up to 43% for two E4 alleles) compared to APOE3 carriers.
*   Conversely, APOE2 carriers show a significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk.
*   Mouse models engineered with different human APOE genotypes confirm a causative role, with APOE2 mice exhibiting the longest lifespan and APOE4 mice the shortest.

## Human Evidence: APOE Genotypes and Longevity
ApoE is associated with longevity independent of Alzheimer's disease. Data in humans shows survival against age for different APOE genotypes: APOE2 (two E2 alleles or one E2 and one E3 allele), APOE3 (two E3 alleles), and APOE4 (one E3 and one E4 allele or two E4 alleles).

At 50% survival, an assessment of average lifespan revealed that APOE2 carriers had the longest average lifespan at about 95 years. APOE3 carriers had a shorter lifespan at approximately 91-92 years, and APOE4 carriers had the shortest lifespan at about 89 years. This represents a 5-6 year difference in average lifespan between APOE2 and APOE4 carriers.

This data supports that APOE2 is associated with longevity. Further analysis investigated its association with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related mortality. Comparing APOE4 carriers with APOE3 carriers, an increased mortality risk was observed in APOE4 carriers, irrespective of whether subjects had Alzheimer's disease or not. Conversely, APOE2 carriers demonstrated a reduced mortality risk compared to APOE3, regardless of AD status. This suggests that APOE2 is associated with longevity independent of Alzheimer's disease.

## Human Evidence: APOE Genotypes and Mortality Risk (Dementia & All-Cause)
Further data from a larger study involving approximately 106,000 subjects also identified associations between the APOE gene and mortality risk, particularly for dementia-associated mortality.

When comparing APOE4 carriers with the APOE3 reference group, a significantly increased mortality risk related to dementia was observed for APOE4 carriers. Carrying one E4 allele (e.g., APOE4/E3) was associated with a 2.33-fold increased risk of dementia-associated mortality compared to APOE3/E3. Carrying two E4 alleles (APOE4/E4) was associated with a 6.49-fold increased risk of dementia-associated mortality compared to APOE3/E3 carriers.

Beyond dementia-associated mortality, the study also examined all-cause mortality, encompassing deaths from cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and other causes. Compared to APOE3/E3, carrying one E4 allele (e.g., APOE4/E3) was associated with a 10% increased all-cause mortality risk, and carrying two E4 alleles (APOE4/E4) was associated with a 43% increased all-cause mortality risk. Conversely, carrying one E2 allele (e.g., APOE3/E2) was associated with a significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk compared to APOE3/E3.

## Causative Role: Mouse Model Data
To investigate causation, Shinohara's group engineered mice to express human APOE2, APOE3, or APOE4. Survival plotted against age demonstrated that mice carrying the APOE2 gene exhibited the longest average lifespan. APOE3 carriers had an intermediate lifespan, and APOE4 carriers had the shortest. This experimental data, consistent with human observational studies, suggests that APOE has a causative role in impacting longevity.
