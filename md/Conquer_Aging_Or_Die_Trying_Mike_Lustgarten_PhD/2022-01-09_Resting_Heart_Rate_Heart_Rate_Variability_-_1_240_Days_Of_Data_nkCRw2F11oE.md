# 2022-01-09 Resting Heart Rate Heart Rate Variability - 1 240 Days Of Data

## Executive Summary

*   Average resting heart rate significantly decreased year-over-year from 2018 to 2021, moving from 50.9 BPM to 47.4 BPM.
*   Heart rate variability (HRV) significantly increased year-over-year from 2018 to 2020, from 47.3 ms to approximately 58 ms, with a dip in 2021.
*   The observed decrease in resting heart rate and increase in HRV, relative to population averages for aging, suggest improved cardiovascular fitness.
*   However, the dip in HRV in 2021 indicates potential room for improvement in cardiovascular health.

## Resting Heart Rate (RHR) Analysis

### Personal Data (2018-2021)

*   **2018 Average RHR:** 50.9 BPM
*   **2019 Average RHR:** 48.9 BPM
*   **2020 Average RHR:** 48.1 BPM
*   **2021 Average RHR:** 47.4 BPM

**Statistical Significance:** Two-sample t-tests comparing each year's RHR against 2018 data showed statistically significant reductions in RHR for 2019, 2020, and 2021.

### RHR and Aging (Population Data)

*   **WHOOP Data (Men, Age 20-50):**
    *   20-year-olds: Below 54 BPM
    *   50-year-olds: Above 56 BPM
    *   *Expected RHR for chronological age (based on this data):* Greater than 56 BPM.
*   **Fitbit Data (Men, Age 20-85):**
    *   RHR increases up to approximately 50 years old.
    *   RHR then declines from approximately 50 to 85 years old.

**Comparison:** The personal RHR of 47.4 BPM in 2021 is significantly lower than the expected RHR for the chronological age based on WHOOP data. This suggests a potential indication of youthfulness or resistance to age-related RHR increases.

## Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Analysis

### Personal Data (2018-2021)

*   **2018 Average HRV:** 47.3 ms
*   **2019 Average HRV:** 56.2 ms
*   **2020 Average HRV:** ~58 ms
*   **2021 Average HRV:** ~52 ms

**Statistical Significance:** Two-sample t-tests comparing each year's HRV against 2018 data showed statistically significant increases in HRV for 2019, 2020, and 2021.

### HRV and Aging (Population Data)

*   **WHOOP Data (Men, Age 20-65):**
    *   High End: ~110 ms (20-year-olds) -> ~60 ms (65-year-olds)
    *   Median: ~80 ms (20-year-olds) -> ~40 ms (65-year-olds)
    *   Low End: ~60 ms (20-year-olds) -> <30 ms (65-year-olds)

**Observation:** Heart rate variability declines significantly during aging.

### Interpretation of Personal Data

*   **Personal Average HRV (over 1240 days):** 54.3 ms.
*   **Median HRV for Age Group (estimated):** ~42 ms.

**Conclusion:** The personal HRV is consistently above the estimated median for the age group. When combined with a declining resting heart rate, this suggests improved cardiovascular function and resistance to age-related declines. However, the dip in HRV in 2021 indicates that maintaining and further improving cardiovascular health remains an ongoing objective. A low resting heart rate coupled with low HRV would indicate poorer cardiovascular function.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

*   **Source:** Whoop fitness tracker.
*   **Metrics:** Resting Heart Rate (RHR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV).
*   **Measurement Timing:** Automatically recorded during the last sleep cycle, minimizing human error.
*   **Data Duration:** August 2018 to December 2021 (1240 days of data).

### Personal Activity Level (2018)

*   **Walking:** Minimum 10-15 miles per week (1 mile each way to work, 5 days a week = 2 miles/day; plus weekend walking).
*   **Strength Training:** 2-3 days per week, at least 1 hour per session.

### Statistical Analysis

*   **Two-sample t-tests:** Used to compare yearly RHR and HRV data against the 2018 baseline to assess statistical significance of changes.

## What is Heart Rate Variability?

Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is defined as the variation in time between successive heartbeats.

**Example Calculation:**
*   Variability in time between beats: 859 ms, 793 ms, 726 ms.
*   HRV (using RMSSD calculation): 67 ms.
