# 2023-10-01 Cholesterol Esters - Underrated Metabolites That Are Associated With Youth And Survival

## Executive Summary

*   Cholesterol esters, particularly those derived from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are inversely associated with all-cause mortality risk and are indicative of a younger epigenetic age.
*   Specific cholesterol esters, such as the 16:1 ester, are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk and an older epigenetic age.
*   Cholesterol ester levels naturally decline with age, but individual ester profiles can vary significantly.
*   At-home metabolomics kits can be used to track levels of numerous cholesterol esters, allowing for potential optimization strategies.
*   Maintaining higher levels of "younger associated" cholesterol esters and lower levels of "older associated" cholesterol esters may be beneficial for healthspan.

## Introduction to Cholesterol Esters

Cholesterol is metabolized into various compounds, including steroid hormones (which decline with age) and bile acids (which increase with age). Cholesterol esters are another important class of cholesterol metabolites. They are formed when cholesterol is esterified with a fatty acid, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (22 carbons, 6 double bonds), in the presence of acyl CoA cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT).

## Age-Related Changes in Cholesterol Esters

A study of approximately 4,200 individuals aged 30 to 89 years indicated that cholesterol ester levels are generally higher in younger age groups (30-59 years) and decline in older age groups (80-89 years). However, it is crucial to analyze specific cholesterol esters, as some may increase with age while others decline.

## Cholesterol Esters and All-Cause Mortality Risk

A study involving over 11,000 individuals with a median follow-up of 23 years analyzed the association between 243 metabolites and all-cause mortality risk. The hazard ratio (HR) indicates the risk of mortality. Values to the right of zero signify increased risk with higher metabolite levels, while values to the left of zero indicate decreased risk.

*   **Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) cholesterol ester (CE 22:6):** Associated with a significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk.
*   **16:1 cholesterol ester (CE 16:1):** Significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.

These findings highlight the divergent effects of specific cholesterol esters on mortality risk, underscoring the importance of individual ester analysis rather than grouping them.

## Cholesterol Esters and Epigenetic Age

Epigenetic age, assessed by validated clocks like PhenoAge and GrimAge, is a measure of biological age based on DNA methylation patterns and is strongly correlated with all-cause mortality.

*   **Red dots:** Indicate higher cholesterol ester levels are associated with an older epigenetic age.
*   **Blue dots (labeled as green in the context of positive association):** Indicate higher cholesterol ester levels are associated with a younger epigenetic age.

### CE 16:1 and Epigenetic Age

*   The CE 16:1 ester is consistently associated with an **older epigenetic age** (indicated by a red dot for both PhenoAge and GrimAge). This aligns with its association with increased all-cause mortality risk.

### CE 22:6 (DHA) and Epigenetic Age

*   The DHA cholesterol ester (CE 22:6) is consistently associated with a **younger epigenetic age** (indicated by a blue dot for both PhenoAge and GrimAge). This further supports its association with reduced all-cause mortality risk.

Other cholesterol esters, such as CE 15:0 and CE 17:0, were also found to be associated with a decreased all-cause mortality risk.

## Tracking and Optimizing Cholesterol Esters

### Tracking Cholesterol Esters

At-home metabolomics kits, such as the iolo kit, can measure a wide range of metabolites, including 22 different cholesterol esters. These kits allow individuals to track their cholesterol ester profiles over time.

### "Younger Associated" Cholesterol Esters

These are cholesterol esters that are associated with a younger epigenetic age. Based on the data, the goal should be to maintain relatively high levels of these esters, as this is associated with younger biological aging.

*   **CE 22:6 (DHA cholesterol ester)** is identified as a "younger associated" cholesterol ester.
*   Other "younger associated" cholesterol esters include CE 15:0 and CE 17:0, among others.

The speaker's personal data showed a decline in the sum of these "younger associated" cholesterol esters over three testing periods, suggesting a trend in the wrong direction.

### "Older Associated" Cholesterol Esters

These are cholesterol esters that are associated with an older epigenetic age. The goal for these esters is to keep their levels relatively low.

*   **CE 16:1** is identified as an "older associated" cholesterol ester.
*   **CE 23:0** is another identified "older associated" cholesterol ester.

The speaker's personal data for the sum of these "older associated" cholesterol esters showed variability, with a general trend towards lower levels, which would be considered favorable.

## Potential Implications and Future Directions

The inverse relationship between certain cholesterol esters and negative health outcomes suggests they are important, yet often overlooked, metabolites. Further research into specific ester targets and personalized strategies for optimizing their levels could be a valuable avenue for promoting healthspan and longevity. The data also hints at potential complexities in NAD+ supplementation, where extremely high levels might be associated with unfavorable epigenetic aging markers.
