# 2024-06-09 Resisting An Increased Epigenetic Speed Of Aging 14-Test Results

## Executive Summary
*   Calorie restriction (12% for two years) significantly slowed the epigenetic speed of aging as measured by Dunedin PACE, while ad libitum eating showed an increase.
*   Dunedin PACE appears to be a more sensitive biomarker for detecting intervention-induced changes in the epigenetic speed of aging compared to Horvath, PhenoAge, and GrimAge.
*   The speaker's most recent Dunedin PACE value of 0.81 is slower than the population average for their chronological age.
*   The speaker's Dunedin PACE has remained relatively stable over 14 tests since 2022, indicating resistance to age-related increases.
*   No statistically significant correlations (p < 0.05) were found between diet, macro-, or micronutrients and Dunedin PACE in the most recent test, necessitating further data collection.

## Human Evidence: Calorie Restriction and Epigenetic Aging

Calorie restriction (CR) has been shown to impact the epigenetic speed of aging. In a 12% CR study for two years:
*   **Ad libitum (AL) group:** Showed a significant increase in epigenetic speed of aging at 12 and 24 months.
*   **Calorie Restricted (CR) group:** Showed a slower epigenetic speed of aging compared to the ad libitum group.

This observation highlights the potential of Dunedin PACE as a biomarker for detecting changes in the epigenetic speed of aging, as other established epigenetic clocks (Horvath, PhenoAge, GrimAge) did not show similar reductions in the CR group.

## Personal Dunedin PACE Data Analysis

The speaker has accumulated data from 14 Dunedin PACE tests conducted since 2022. The goal is to achieve a Dunedin PACE value of 0.6, representing the slowest epigenetic aging rate, and to resist age-related increases in this rate.

**Dunedin PACE Scale:**
*   0.6: Slowest epigenetic aging rate
*   1.4: Fastest epigenetic aging rate

**Recent Test Results (04/29/2024):**
*   Dunedin PACE value: 0.81

**Trend Analysis (14 Tests):**
*   **2022 (3 tests):** Average Dunedin PACE = 0.84
*   **2023 (8 tests):** Average Dunedin PACE = 0.80
*   **2024 (3 tests so far):** Average Dunedin PACE = 0.81

**Key Observations:**
*   Dunedin PACE has remained mostly stable.
*   While not yet at the target of 0.6, the stability indicates resistance to an age-related increase in epigenetic aging speed.
*   The speaker's most recent data point (0.81) is below the average Dunedin PACE for their chronological age, suggesting a slower epigenetic aging rate relative to the population average.

**Goals:**
1.  Consistently achieve a Dunedin PACE of 0.6.
2.  Resist the age-related increase in Dunedin PACE.

**Current Status:**
*   Resisting age-related increase: Achieved (Checked)
*   Consistently achieving 0.6: Not yet achieved (Needs optimization)

## Correlation Analysis: Diet and Dunedin PACE

Following each test, correlations between diet and Dunedin PACE are evaluated. For the most recent test, 103 comparisons were made for foods, macro-, and micronutrients.

**Findings:**
*   No statistically significant correlations (p < 0.05) were found between dietary factors and Dunedin PACE.
*   The closest association was with Vitamin B6, with a p-value of 0.08.

**Implication:**
Without significant correlations, it is challenging to identify specific dietary interventions for the next test aimed at improving Dunedin PACE.

## Future Plans

*   **Data Collection:** Increase testing frequency in 2024 to at least 10 tests (compared to 8 in 2023) to gather more data for robust correlation analysis and potential future improvements.
