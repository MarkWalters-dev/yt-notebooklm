# 2025-06-08 Resisting Age-Related Blood Pressure Changes - 336 Days Of Testing

## Executive Summary

*   Reducing blood pressure is associated with a 15% lower risk of dementia and a reduced risk of various cardiovascular outcomes, including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular death.
*   Systolic blood pressure naturally increases with age, while diastolic blood pressure increases until midlife and then declines.
*   Over nearly three years (336 data points), the subject has successfully resisted the age-related increase in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
*   Lower body weight is significantly correlated with lower blood pressure, with a body weight around 138-140 pounds correlating with the most youthful blood pressure readings.
*   Future strategies to maintain youthful blood pressure may involve correlating and tweaking diet if any deviations from optimal levels are observed.

## Introduction

Blood pressure is a critical biomarker for longevity and overall health. Lowering blood pressure has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of dementia and cardiovascular-related outcomes. While age-related increases in systolic blood pressure and midlife increases followed by declines in diastolic blood pressure are typical, this study tracks efforts to counteract these trends.

## Blood Pressure and Health Outcomes

*   **Dementia Risk:** Reducing blood pressure is associated with a 15% lower risk of dementia.
*   **Cardiovascular Risk:** Lower blood pressure is linked to reduced risks of:
    *   Myocardial infarction (heart attack)
    *   Stroke
    *   Heart failure
    *   Cardiovascular death

## Age-Related Blood Pressure Changes

*   **Systolic Blood Pressure:** Increases continuously during aging.
*   **Diastolic Blood Pressure:** Increases until midlife and then declines during aging.

## Study Methodology

The following protocol was used for blood pressure measurements:

*   **Time Period:** September 2022 to May 2025 (nearly 3 years).
*   **Data Points:** 336 data points for systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
*   **Measurement Timing:**
    *   Consistently between 11:30 AM and 1:00 PM.
    *   Primarily between 11:30 AM and 12:00 PM, with rare data points from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM.
*   **Measurement Frequency:**
    *   Five to six measurements taken within the 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM window.
    *   Measurements were taken every couple of minutes with the cuff remaining on the arm.
    *   The average of these five to six values was recorded for the day.
*   **Eating and Drinking:** Measurements were taken 4-5 hours after consuming food or water, indicating testing on days with primarily morning caloric intake.

## Personal Blood Pressure Data (336 Data Points)

**Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg):**

*   **2022 Average:** ~122
*   **2023 Average:** ~119
*   **2024 Average:** ~118
*   **2025 (through early May) Average:** ~118

**Conclusion:** The subject has resisted the age-related increase in systolic blood pressure over the nearly three-year period.

**Diastolic Blood Pressure (mmHg):**

*   **2022 Average:** ~73
*   **2023 Average:** ~70
*   **2024 Average:** ~69
*   **2025 Average:** ~70

**Conclusion:** The subject has resisted the age-related increase in diastolic blood pressure, particularly notable within the 50-60 age range where an increase would typically be expected.

## Comparison to Youth and Chronological Age Expected Values

*   **Average Blood Pressure in Youth (18-year-olds):** 118/67 mmHg.
*   **Subject's Current Average Blood Pressure:** Approximately 118/70 mmHg.
*   **Chronological Age Expected Blood Pressure (52 years old):** Approximately 127/77 mmHg.

**Conclusion:** The subject's blood pressure readings are comparable to those of 18-year-olds and significantly lower than the expected values for their chronological age of 52, indicating a youthful blood pressure profile.

## Factors Influencing Blood Pressure

### Body Weight Correlation

Data collected on body weight (weighed daily after bathroom use) shows a significant positive correlation with both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

*   **Correlation Coefficient (r):** 0.4 for both systolic and diastolic.
*   **P-value:** Far below 0.05 for both.

**Observations:**

*   **Lower Body Weight (approx. 138-140 lbs):** Correlates with the lowest and most youthful blood pressure readings (both systolic and diastolic).
*   **Higher Body Weight (approx. 15 lbs heavier in 2022):** Correlates with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, reflecting the typical age-related trend.

**Current Status:** The subject's current body weight is 140 lbs. The goal is to avoid dropping below this weight to prevent potential loss of muscle mass, which can negatively impact workout performance and is already a factor that declines with aging.

## Future Strategies for Blood Pressure Maintenance

If blood pressure begins to deviate from optimal levels:

1.  **Dietary Correlation:** Track correlations between diet (foods, macros, micros) and systolic blood pressure.
2.  **Dietary Tweaks:** Adjust diet to maintain the most youthful blood pressure possible for as long as possible.
