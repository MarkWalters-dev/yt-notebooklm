# 2022-02-27 Centenarian Blood Test Analysis n=1 754 Part I

## Executive Summary

*   Centenarians in the Hainan study (median age 100 years) exhibit fasting plasma glucose levels within the optimal range for minimizing all-cause mortality risk, indicative of youthful glucose metabolism.
*   Total protein and albumin levels in centenarians are significantly lower than expected for their chronological age, aligning with levels seen in individuals 30-40 years younger, and contributing to reduced age-expected all-cause mortality risk for albumin.
*   Globulin (gamma gap) levels in centenarians fall below a critical threshold associated with significantly improved survival rates, suggesting healthy globulin metabolism.
*   Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in centenarians indicates kidney function comparable to individuals approximately 35 years younger.
*   Serum uric acid levels in centenarians are very close to the optimal range for minimizing all-cause mortality risk, suggesting healthy uric acid metabolism.
*   Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels in centenarians are also close to optimal for minimizing all-cause mortality risk, consistent with younger age groups.
*   Triglyceride levels in centenarians are within the range associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk, supporting the hypothesis that low triglycerides are a hallmark of longevity.
*   HDL cholesterol levels in centenarians are significantly lower than expected for their chronological age, aligning with much younger individuals and placing them at the lowest risk for all-cause mortality.

## Study Overview

*   **Study:** Hainan Centenarian Study
*   **Participants:** 1,754 subjects
*   **Median Age:** 100 years
*   **Gender Distribution:** 28% men, 72% women (consistent with higher female longevity)
*   **Biomarkers Analyzed (Part I):** 8 out of 16 published variables.

## Biomarker Analysis

### Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG)

*   **Trend with Aging:** Blood glucose levels increase with age in both men and women.
*   **Centenarian Data:** Median FPG is 83 mg/dL (4.6 mmol/L), indicative of youthful levels and located at the far left of the aging curve.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** A J-shaped curve exists for all-cause mortality risk, with the lowest risk observed between 80-94 mg/dL (4.4-5.2 mmol/L).
*   **Centenarian Position:** Centenarian FPG levels fall within the lowest range for all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Conclusion:** Centenarians have relatively youthful and healthy glucose levels.

### Total Protein

*   **Trend with Aging:** Total protein declines with age, from approximately 7.4 g/dL in younger individuals to 6.6-6.8 g/dL in older adults.
*   **Centenarian Data:** Median total protein is 7.03 g/dL (converted from 70.3 g/L), which corresponds to the range observed in individuals aged 60-70 years.
*   **Conclusion:** Centenarians exhibit total protein levels 30-40 years younger than their chronological age.

### Albumin

*   **Trend with Aging:** Albumin levels decline with age. Peak values are around 46 g/L for men and 45 g/L for women.
*   **Centenarian Data:** Median albumin is 40.5 g/L.
*   **Age Equivalence:** This level is comparable to that of an 80-year-old, indicating albumin levels 20 years younger than their chronological age.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** Lowest all-cause mortality risk is associated with albumin levels around 46 g/L.
*   **Centenarian All-Cause Mortality Impact:** The centenarian median albumin of 40.5 g/L, compared to an age-expected level of 36 g/L, is associated with a 75% lower age-expected all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Conclusion:** Centenarians possess youthful albumin levels and a significantly reduced age-expected all-cause mortality risk related to albumin.

### Globulin (Gamma Gap)

*   **Calculation:** Globulin = Total Protein - Albumin. Also referred to as the gamma gap.
*   **Centenarian Data:** Median globulin level is 2.98 g/dL (converted from 29.8 g/L).
*   **Survival Association (in 94-year-olds):**
    *   Gamma gap < 3.2 g/dL (blue line) is associated with significantly improved median survival.
    *   Gamma gap > 3.2 g/dL (red line) is associated with reduced median survival.
*   **Centenarian Position:** Centenarian globulin levels of 2.98 g/dL fall on the blue curve, indicating significantly improved survival.
*   **Conclusion:** Centenarians have relatively healthy globulin levels associated with better survival.

### Serum Creatinine (and eGFR)

*   **Marker for Kidney Function:** Creatinine is used to estimate Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR).
*   **Centenarian Data:** Median eGFR is 59.8, close to 60.
*   **Trend with Aging:** eGFR declines with age, from approximately 125 in youth to near 50 for individuals over 95 years old.
*   **Age Equivalence:** The centenarian eGFR of 59.8 corresponds to the kidney function of an individual around 65 years old, indicating 35 years younger than their chronological age.
*   **Caveat:** Creatinine may not be an ideal marker for kidney function in individuals over 65.
*   **Conclusion:** Centenarians exhibit younger than expected kidney function.

### Uric Acid (SUA)

*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** Lowest all-cause mortality risk is associated with uric acid levels around 303 micromolar.
*   **Centenarian Data:** Median uric acid level is 326 micromolar.
*   **Centenarian Position:** This level is very close to the optimal range for minimizing all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Conclusion:** Centenarians have close to optimal uric acid levels.

### Urea (Blood Urea Nitrogen - BUN)

*   **Trend with Aging:** Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) increases with age.
*   **Centenarian Data:** Median BUN is 16 mg/dL.
*   **Age Equivalence:** This level corresponds to the 60-70 year old age range, indicating BUN levels 30-40 years younger than their chronological age.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** The lowest all-cause mortality risk is associated with BUN levels of 5.26 to 14.7 mg/dL.
*   **Centenarian Position:** The centenarian BUN of 16 mg/dL is very close to the optimal range for minimizing all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Conclusion:** Centenarians have younger than expected and relatively healthy BUN levels.

### Triglycerides (TGs)

*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** As triglyceride levels increase, all-cause mortality risk also increases. The lowest risk is associated with triglyceride levels around 90 mg/dL (1.02 mmol/L).
*   **Centenarian Data:** Median triglyceride level is 1.1 mmol/L (97.4 mg/dL).
*   **Centenarian Position:** This level is very close to the lowest risk observed on the plot.
*   **Longevity Association:** Data from 11 centenarian studies show that in 9 of them, triglycerides were lower than 101 mg/dL. This study is the 12th such study where triglycerides are relatively low.
*   **Conclusion:** Centenarians have relatively healthy triglyceride levels, supporting the hypothesis that low triglycerides are a hallmark of longevity.

### HDL Cholesterol

*   **Trend with Aging:** HDL peaks in youth and declines with age in both men and women, with women generally having higher levels than men.
*   **Centenarian Data:** Median HDL is 54 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L).
*   **Age Equivalence:**
    *   For women, this level is comparable to that of a 74-year-old (26 years younger).
    *   For men, this level is comparable to that of an 18-28 year old (26-82 years younger).
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** A median HDL of 54 mg/dL places centenarians at the bottom of the all-cause mortality risk curve, indicating the lowest risk.
*   **Conclusion:** Centenarians exhibit significantly youthful and healthy levels of HDL cholesterol.
