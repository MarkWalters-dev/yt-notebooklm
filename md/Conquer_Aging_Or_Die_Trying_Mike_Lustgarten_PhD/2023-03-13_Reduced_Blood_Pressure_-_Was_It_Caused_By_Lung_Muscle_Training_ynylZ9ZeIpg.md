# 2023-03-13 Reduced Blood Pressure - Was It Caused By Lung Muscle Training

## Executive Summary

*   Inspiratory muscle training was shown to reduce systolic blood pressure by 3.1 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 2.5 mmHg.
*   Following cessation of lung training, systolic blood pressure remained stable, and diastolic blood pressure showed a non-significant decrease, suggesting the reduction was not solely due to the training device.
*   Systolic blood pressure is positively correlated with body weight, indicating that a decrease in body weight may lead to lower systolic blood pressure.
*   Diastolic blood pressure is also positively correlated with body weight, suggesting that a decrease in body weight may lead to lower diastolic blood pressure.
*   Optimal blood pressure, defined as systolic less than 115 mmHg and diastolic less than 75 mmHg, is associated with lower brain age.

## Introduction to Blood Pressure and Aging

### Systolic Blood Pressure Over Time

*   Systolic blood pressure generally increases with age in both men and women.
*   The speaker's average systolic blood pressure over a three-year period (September 2019 - October 2022) was 123.1 mmHg.
*   This average is slightly below the expected systolic blood pressure of 125 mmHg for the speaker's chronological age.
*   For comparison, systolic blood pressure in 18-year-old males is around 118 mmHg.

### Optimal Systolic Blood Pressure

*   A 2021 study found that systolic blood pressure below 115 mmHg is associated with significantly lower brain ages as determined by MRI scans.
*   The goal is to achieve a systolic blood pressure below 115 mmHg.

### Diastolic Blood Pressure Over Time

*   Diastolic blood pressure exhibits an inverted U-shaped pattern during aging, meaning it increases and then decreases with age.
*   The speaker's average diastolic blood pressure over the same three-year period was 74.6 mmHg.
*   The expected diastolic blood pressure for the speaker's chronological age (50 years) is around 77 mmHg.
*   The speaker's diastolic blood pressure data technically falls within the range for individuals aged 35-40 years, as well as 65-70 years, making age-related plots less informative for this metric.

### Optimal Diastolic Blood Pressure

*   The same 2021 study indicated that individuals with diastolic blood pressure less than 75 mmHg, or a combination of systolic less than 115 mmHg and diastolic less than 75 mmHg, had significantly lower brain ages.
*   The goal is to maintain diastolic blood pressure below 75 mmHg.

## Impact of Lung Muscle Training on Blood Pressure

### Systolic Blood Pressure

*   **Pre-Lung Training Average (3-year period):** 123.1 mmHg
*   **With Lung Training Device (Breather FIT):** 120.3 mmHg
*   A two-sample t-test showed a statistically significant reduction in systolic blood pressure when using the lung training device.
*   **Post Lung Training Device (7 weeks without device):** 120.5 mmHg
*   Systolic blood pressure did not increase after discontinuing the lung training device, suggesting factors other than the device may be influencing blood pressure.

### Diastolic Blood Pressure

*   **Pre-Lung Training Average (3-year period):** 74.6 mmHg
*   **With Lung Training Device (Breather FIT):** 72.1 mmHg
*   A two-sample t-test showed a statistically significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure when using the lung training device.
*   **Post Lung Training Device:** 71.2 mmHg
*   Diastolic blood pressure did not significantly increase after discontinuing the lung training device, further supporting the idea that other factors are at play.

## Potential Factors Influencing Blood Pressure

### Correlation with Body Weight

*   Body weight is significantly correlated with blood pressure in the speaker's data.
*   **Systolic Blood Pressure vs. Body Weight:** A significant positive correlation was observed over 102 days of data (September 2019 - February 2023). Higher body weight is associated with higher systolic blood pressure.
*   **Diastolic Blood Pressure vs. Body Weight:** Similar to systolic blood pressure, a significant positive correlation exists. Higher body weight is associated with higher diastolic blood pressure.

### Impact of Body Weight on Achieving Optimal Blood Pressure

*   Reducing body weight towards 148 lbs or lower is suggested to help achieve systolic blood pressure consistently below 115 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure below 75 mmHg.
*   This, in turn, may contribute to slowing brain aging.
