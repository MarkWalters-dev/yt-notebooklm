# 2023-10-08 Higher HRV Lower RHR - Potential Impacts For Weight Loss And Consistent Exercise Training

## Executive Summary

*   Higher daily physical activity is negatively correlated with next-day resting heart rate and heart rate variability, suggesting that excessive activity without adequate recovery can be detrimental to these metrics.
*   Finding a balance between active and rest days, with a strategy of titrating activity lower after intense workout days, appears beneficial for optimizing HRV and RHR.
*   Decreasing body weight is significantly correlated with a lower resting heart rate and a higher heart rate variability, suggesting that weight loss can lead to more "youthful" cardiovascular metrics.
*   As body weight approaches approximately 142 pounds, resting heart rate trends towards lower values (around 41 bpm) and heart rate variability trends towards higher values (close to 70).

## Impact of Physical Activity on HRV and RHR

*   **Correlation with Next-Day Resting Heart Rate (RHR):** A significant positive correlation exists between the previous day's average daily heart rate (as an index of physical activity) and the next-day resting heart rate. This indicates that excessive daily activity can negatively impact RHR.
*   **Correlation with Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** A significant negative correlation exists between the previous day's average daily heart rate and the next-day heart rate variability. This suggests that too much daily activity can be detrimental to HRV.
*   **Balancing Activity and Rest:** The data indicates that higher previous day average daily heart rates are significantly correlated with worse HRV and RHR. Therefore, finding a balance between active and rest days is crucial for optimizing these metrics.

### Recommended Exercise Protocol for Optimization

*   **Active Day:** Includes an 85-minute full-body workout (strength training, calisthenics, mobility, flexibility).
*   **Post-Active Day Strategy:** Titrate overall activity and average daily heart rate lower for the subsequent two days.
*   **Cycle:** Engage in the usual workout, followed by at least two days of titrated lower average daily heart rate.
*   **Recent Adaptation:** A recent shift to a three-day active / four-day lower activity cycle has not resulted in strength or functional deficits.
*   **Observed Optimum:** Two workouts per week appear to be optimal for long-term HRV and RHR, allowing for sufficient recovery before each workout.

## Impact of Body Weight on HRV and RHR

### Relationship Between Body Weight and Resting Heart Rate (RHR)

*   **Observational Trend:** Over the tracking period since August 2018, periods of reduced body weight have coincided with decreased resting heart rate, while periods of increased body weight have coincided with increased resting heart rate.
*   **Direct Correlation:** A significant positive correlation exists between daily resting heart rate and body weight.
    *   As body weight increases, resting heart rate significantly increases.
    *   As body weight decreases, approaching approximately 142 pounds, resting heart rate approaches lower values, around 41 beats per minute.

### Relationship Between Body Weight and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

*   **Observational Trend:** While not as overtly overlapping as RHR, trends indicate that during periods of reduced body weight, heart rate variability has increased. Conversely, during periods of increased body weight, heart rate variability has decreased.
*   **Direct Correlation:** A significant negative correlation exists between daily heart rate variability and body weight.
    *   As body weight increases, heart rate variability significantly decreases, moving in an unfavorable direction.
    *   As body weight decreases, approaching approximately 142 pounds and becoming leaner, heart rate variability approaches more youthful values, close to 70.

### Conclusion on Body Weight

*   As body weight decreases, both heart rate variability and resting heart rate approach more youthful values, characterized by higher HRV in conjunction with lower RHR.
