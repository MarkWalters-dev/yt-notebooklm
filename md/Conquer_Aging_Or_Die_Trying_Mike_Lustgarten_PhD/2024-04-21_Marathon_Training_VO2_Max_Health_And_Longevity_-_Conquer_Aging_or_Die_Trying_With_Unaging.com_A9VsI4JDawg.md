# 2024-04-21 Marathon Training VO2 Max Health And Longevity - Conquer Aging or Die Trying With Unaging.com

## Executive Summary

*   Consistent weekly running, even for as little as 15 minutes, significantly reduces all-cause mortality by approximately 40%, with no additional benefit observed from increased frequency or speed beyond a certain threshold.
*   Mitochondrial mass (indicated by citrate synthase activity) increases linearly with total training volume and plateaus within approximately a year, suggesting consistency over extreme volume is key for mitochondrial biogenesis.
*   Sprint interval training (SIT) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) are most effective at increasing mitochondrial efficiency, while moderate-intensity continuous training primarily boosts mitochondrial mass.
*   A VO2 max of approximately 51 ml/kg/min places individuals in the "extremely fit" category, associated with an 84% lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to the least fit. However, the life expectancy gains beyond this point are more modest than often implied.
*   Maintaining high heart rate variability (HRV) and low resting heart rate during intense training periods, even with reduced training volume, indicates good adaptation and avoidance of overtraining.

## Marathon Training and Longevity

### Running and All-Cause Mortality

*   Governmental recommendations for exercise (e.g., 150 minutes per week) are often vague and do not clearly delineate the benefits of increased volume or intensity across different sports.
*   Studies on running demonstrate a consistent reduction in all-cause mortality (premature death) of approximately 40% for individuals who run at least 15 minutes per week.
*   This mortality benefit appears to be consistent regardless of exercise frequency (1-6 times per week) or speed (light jog vs. faster pace), suggesting that simply engaging in running offers significant protection.

### Mitochondrial Adaptations to Exercise

*   **Mitochondrial Function:** Mitochondria are organelles responsible for cellular energy production. Increases in aerobic fitness are largely attributed to increases in mitochondrial mass and efficiency.
    *   **Citrate Synthase (CS) Activity:** CS is a marker of mitochondrial mass.
        *   Relative exercise intensity (40% to 100%) shows a weak correlation with CS activity increase. This means that increasing intensity alone doesn't dramatically boost mitochondrial mass.
        *   CS activity increases linearly with total training volume (defined as time x weeks x intensity). This indicates that accumulating more training volume over time is the primary driver of increased mitochondrial mass.
        *   The body's capacity for mitochondrial mass appears to plateau within about a year, suggesting that consistency in training leads to maximal gains over time, rather than just increasing volume indefinitely.
    *   **Mitochondrial Efficiency:** This refers to how effectively mitochondria convert fuel into energy.
        *   **Sprint Interval Training (SIT):** Provides the most significant increase in mitochondrial efficiency, but the low volume achievable makes it difficult to sustain for long durations.
        *   **High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) and Mixed Training:** Require training at 90% or more of maximum heart rate to achieve significant increases in mitochondrial efficiency.
        *   **Moderate Intensity Continuous Training:** Primarily contributes to increasing the total number of mitochondria (mass).

### Marathon Training Protocol and Data

*   Chris Mann Loomis's marathon training program was designed based on a "less is more" approach, focusing on specific training components:
    *   **High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT):** To increase mitochondrial efficiency.
    *   **Moderate-Intensity Long Slow Distance (LSD) Runs:** To increase mitochondrial mass.
    *   **Tempo Runs:** To simulate race pace and build endurance at faster speeds.
*   The training program consisted of:
    *   One long run (10-20 miles / 16-32 km) per week.
    *   One speed work session (HIIT) per week.
    *   One tempo run (3-10 miles / 5-15 km) per week.
*   This protocol involved significantly less weekly volume than typical marathon training plans.
*   **VO2 Max Testing:** Pre-marathon training VO2 max was 55. A VO2 max test involves running on a treadmill with a mask to measure oxygen consumption.
*   **Progression Tracking:** Using Regal's formula, Chris tracked projected marathon finish times weekly.
    *   Initial projection: ~3 hours 40 minutes.
    *   Progression: Improved speeds, with tempo runs showing the most reliable gains.
    *   Final projection: Under 3 hours 20 minutes.
    *   Overall improvement: Approximately 1% per week for the first 10 weeks, resulting in about a 20-minute reduction in projected marathon time.

### Avoiding "Hitting the Wall" (Bonking)

*   **The Challenge:** Marathons are long (26.2 miles / 42 km), and runners often experience a significant performance drop in the final 10 km ("hitting the wall" or "bonking") due to glycogen depletion. This is because the body's natural energy stores (glycogen) can only fuel about 30 km of running.
*   **Scientific Approach vs. Freestyle:**
    *   **Scientific Approach:** Involves strategic calorie intake during the race.
    *   **Freestyle Approach:** No structured caloric intake during the race.
*   **Energy Needs:** Running a marathon requires over 2,000 calories.
*   **Calorie Intake During Race:**
    *   The scientific approach, which includes taking in calories (gels) during the race, helps maintain pace throughout the marathon.
    *   The freestyle approach leads to a significant pace decline after the 30 km mark, resulting in an average 10-minute slower finish time.
    *   **Recommendation:** Taking gels during a marathon, even with potential minor indigestion, is crucial to avoid bonking and is generally better than not taking them.
*   **Carb Loading:** While pre-race carbohydrate loading is common, studies show that taking gels *during* the race has a more significant positive impact on performance than carb loading alone.
    *   A study with cyclists found that those who consumed gels during the race performed best, regardless of whether they had breakfast.
    *   Consuming approximately 1,000 calories or more in the form of sugar during the marathon is recommended to replenish depleted glucose levels.

### Marathon Outcome and Post-Marathon Data

*   **Post-Training VO2 Max:** The week before the marathon, Chris's VO2 max increased to 61.5, placing him in the top ~0.3% for his age group.
*   **Marathon Finish Time:** 3 hours 26 minutes, exceeding the goal of 3.5 hours and nearly qualifying for the Boston Marathon.
*   **Post-Marathon Recovery:** Severe fatigue and physical discomfort for several weeks, including pain in knees and difficulty with stairs, highlighting the toll of marathon training.
*   **Blood Work (During Training):**
    *   Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT) and a stressed heart indicator were observed mid-training.
    *   Free testosterone was below the normal range.
    *   These markers returned to normal within a month after the marathon, suggesting they were temporary effects of extreme training stress.
*   **Current Training:** Reduced to two 30-minute high-intensity interval training (HIIT) sessions per week.
*   **Current VO2 Max (Estimated):** 53, as indicated by an Apple Watch (with an estimated 10-point gap from actual measured VO2 max).

## Health and Longevity Metrics

### Sleep Quality

*   **Slow Wave Sleep (Deep Sleep):** This stage of sleep is crucial for recovery and is known to decrease with age.
    *   A meta-analysis shows a decline in slow wave sleep percentage from ~25% in very young individuals to ~8% in individuals in their eighties.
    *   Slow wave sleep is linked to reduced Alzheimer's disease risk.
*   **Marathon Training Impact:** During Chris's marathon training, his slow wave sleep percentage remained relatively stable between 18.3% and 21%, which is considered good and better than expected for his chronological age based on trend lines. The final weeks of training, with reduced intensity ("deloading"), showed the highest slow wave sleep percentage.

### Respiratory Rate

*   **Nighttime Respiratory Rate:** Lower nighttime respiratory rates (below 16 breaths per minute) have been associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality in older adults.
*   Chris's nighttime respiratory rate consistently remained below this 16 breaths per minute cutoff, indicating a positive indicator for longevity.

### Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Resting Heart Rate

*   **HRV and Resting Heart Rate (RHR):** These metrics are indicators of autonomic nervous system balance and recovery. Consistently high HRV and low RHR are generally associated with better health and fitness.
*   **Marathon Training Impact:**
    *   Chris's HRV and RHR remained remarkably stable throughout his marathon training, even with varying training volumes. This suggests a robust adaptation to training and avoidance of the overtraining phenotype (characterized by declining HRV and increasing RHR).
    *   His HRV, even during periods of high training stress, was consistently above the median for his chronological age, indicating a youthful physiological profile.
    *   His monthly average RHR (48-49 bpm) was exceptionally low, aligning with that of a much younger individual.
*   **Factors Affecting HRV:** Alcohol consumption on weekends was noted as a significant factor that could temporarily lower HRV. However, Chris reported not noticing a significant impact on his subsequent workout performance.
*   **Training Dose and Recovery:** The "less is more" approach, with lower overall training volume (3 days/week) and deliberate rest days, likely contributed to his ability to maintain stable HRV and RHR. This "clever scheduling" allowed for adequate recovery between intense sessions.

### VO2 Max and Mortality Risk

*   **VO2 Max Definition:** The maximum amount of oxygen the body can utilize during intense exercise, measured in milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute (ml/kg/min).
*   **Fitness Categories and Mortality:** A study comparing fitness levels against mortality risk found:
    *   **Least Fit (VO2 Max ~17):** Fourfold higher risk of all-cause death compared to the extremely fit group.
    *   **Extremely Fit (VO2 Max ~51):** Associated with the lowest mortality risk.
*   **The "Elite Endurance Athlete" Myth:** While high VO2 max is beneficial, the data suggests that extremely high VO2 max (e.g., >50 ml/kg/min) may offer diminishing returns for longevity compared to being "highly fit" (VO2 max ~42 ml/kg/min).
    *   The difference in all-cause mortality risk between the "highly fit" and "extremely fit" groups was smaller than between "highly fit" and "least fit."
*   **Life Expectancy Gains:**
    *   Individuals with VO2 max between 35-43 ml/kg/min (fit to highly fit) lived only 4-6 years longer than the least fit group.
    *   The highest fit group (VO2 max >51) showed an average increase of approximately 7 years in life expectancy compared to the least fit.
    *   This contrasts with the idea that extremely high VO2 max leads to dramatically extended lifespans (e.g., living to 115).
*   **Body Mass Index (BMI):** The VO2 max study participants were largely overweight or obese. Attaining a high VO2 max even with a higher BMI still conferred significant mortality benefits, though the optimal scenario likely involves a lean physique combined with high cardiovascular fitness.
*   **Exercise Prescription:** The optimal exercise dose should balance improving VO2 max with maintaining high HRV and low RHR, avoiding overtraining. Consistency with an efficient training regimen (e.g., two 30-minute HIIT sessions per week) can achieve these goals.

### Comprehensive Fitness and Aging

*   **Beyond Cardio:** While VO2 max is important, a comprehensive fitness approach should also include strength training and flexibility to combat age-related declines in mobility, balance, and muscle mass.
*   **Maintaining Functionality:** Training all aspects of fitness ensures individuals can maintain independence and functionality in later life.
*   **Balance Training:** Simple exercises like putting on socks while standing on one foot or performing yoga poses can significantly improve balance and prevent falls.
*   **Strength and Flexibility:** Exercises like squats and deadlifts contribute to maintaining muscle mass, flexibility, and joint health.
*   **HIIT's Contribution:** High-intensity interval training can also improve balance and coordination due to the dynamic, unilateral movements involved in sprinting.
