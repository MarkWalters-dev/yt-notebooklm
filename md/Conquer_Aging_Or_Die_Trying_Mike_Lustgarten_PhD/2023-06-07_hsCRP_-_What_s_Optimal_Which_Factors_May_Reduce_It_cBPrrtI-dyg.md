# 2023-06-07 hsCRP - What s Optimal Which Factors May Reduce It

### Executive Summary

*   High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels increase with age, doubling from an average of 0.8 mg/L in youth to 1.6 mg/L in individuals over 70.
*   An hsCRP level greater than 1 mg/L is associated with increased all-cause mortality risk, suggesting that optimal levels may be as close to zero as possible.
*   Dietary intake, particularly of turmeric, is significantly correlated with lower hsCRP levels. Other foods also show nominal correlations with reduced hsCRP.
*   A higher average daily heart rate, reflecting increased physical activity and/or stress, is significantly correlated with higher hsCRP.
*   Minimizing hsCRP may involve maintaining an optimal average daily heart rate of 55-57 beats per minute (approximately 12-14 bpm above resting heart rate).

## hsCRP, Aging, and All-Cause Mortality Risk

High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels increase during aging. In youth (18 years old), average CRP levels are 0.8 milligrams per liter. For people older than 70, average CRP values double to 1.6 milligrams per liter.

This age-related increase is significant because a relatively higher hsCRP level is associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk. A meta-analysis of 27 studies involving over 480,000 people demonstrated this association. A statistically significant association with increased all-cause mortality risk is observed when hsCRP levels are greater than one milligram per liter. As CRP levels increase, the association with all-cause mortality risk also increases.

## Optimal hsCRP Levels

In youth, the upper limit of the typical CRP range is about one milligram per liter, prompting the question of whether less than one milligram per liter is optimal for hsCRP. Further analysis within the 0 to 1 milligram per liter range indicates that hsCRP levels are significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality risk, with risk increasing above zero. Therefore, an hsCRP level as close to zero as possible may be optimal for all-cause mortality risk.

## Methodology for Identifying Dietary Factors

To identify factors that may reduce hsCRP, a personal dietary tracking methodology was employed:

*   Since April 2015, all food intake has been weighed using a food scale and logged into Cronometer.
*   Each blood test since 2015 has a corresponding average diet composition, allowing for the calculation of correlations between diet (macro/micronutrients, individual foods) and blood biomarkers.
*   The diet is then altered with the goal of improving blood biomarkers.
*   After each subsequent blood test, correlations are recalculated, and the process of adjusting food intake (increasing or decreasing specific foods) is repeated based on the correlation data.

This approach has been applied to 27 blood tests for hsCRP over a five-year period (starting in 2018 when hsCRP tracking began).

## Dietary Factors Affecting hsCRP

The strongest dietary correlation found with lower hsCRP is with turmeric intake. Specifically, a relatively higher average daily intake of turmeric (in powdered form, added to cooked meals) is significantly correlated with lower hsCRP.

Several other foods show a nominal statistical significance (p-value < 0.05) in correlation with lower hsCRP. The strategy involves maintaining high intake of foods correlated with lower CRP and minimizing intake of those correlated with higher CRP.

This approach has led to personal hsCRP levels being below the detection limit of 0.3 milligrams per liter for the last 10 blood tests, suggesting its effectiveness.

## Activity and Stress as Factors

Beyond diet, other factors may impact hsCRP. A significant positive correlation exists between a higher average daily heart rate (calculated over the full day, not just resting heart rate) and hsCRP. This data spans three years and 19 hsCRP blood tests, tracking average daily heart rate since 2020 via a fitness tracker.

A higher daily heart rate, indicative of increased physical activity and/or stress (emotional or work-related), is significantly correlated with higher hsCRP between blood tests. Conversely, lower levels of activity and/or stress are correlated with lower hsCRP.

For minimizing hsCRP, these data suggest an optimal full-day average daily heart rate of 55-57 beats per minute. For context, the individual's average resting heart rate in May 2023 was 42.6 beats per minute, implying that maintaining an average daily heart rate 12-14 beats per minute above resting may be optimal for keeping hsCRP low. This raises the question of whether the amount of physical activity that optimizes fitness differs from that which optimizes longevity, given the correlation between higher activity and higher hsCRP.
