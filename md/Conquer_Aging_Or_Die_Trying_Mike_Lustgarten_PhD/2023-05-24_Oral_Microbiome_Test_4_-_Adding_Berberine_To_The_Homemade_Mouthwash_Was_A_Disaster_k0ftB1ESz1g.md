# 2023-05-24 Oral Microbiome Test 4 - Adding Berberine To The Homemade Mouthwash Was A Disaster

## Executive Summary

*   Oral bacteria, including *Porphyromonas gingivalis*, *Fusobacterium nucleatum*, and *Tannerella forsythia*, have been previously linked with Alzheimer's disease.
*   In vitro studies showed that berberine effectively reduced levels of *P. gingivalis* and *Fusobacterium* in saliva spiked with *P. gingivalis*.
*   For personal oral microbiome test number four, incorporating berberine into a homemade mouthwash led to a reduction in *P. gingivalis* but a dramatic 8.6-fold increase in *F. nucleatum* and *T. forsythia* compared to previous averages.
*   This adverse outcome is hypothesized to be due to an excessively high berberine concentration in the homemade mouthwash, exceeding levels proven effective in vitro.
*   Future strategy involves removing berberine from the mouthwash and implementing a new oral hygiene protocol for Test 5, including daily toothbrushing, tongue scraping, and Waterpik use.

## Background: Oral Bacteria & Alzheimer's

Oral bacteria, specifically *Porphyromonas gingivalis*, *Fusobacterium nucleatum*, and *Tannerella forsythia*, have been linked with Alzheimer's disease. The objective of this fourth oral microbiome test was to reduce salivary levels of these bacteria by adding berberine to a homemade mouthwash.

## In Vitro Berberine Efficacy

Previous in vitro data demonstrated that adding berberine to *P. gingivalis*-spiked saliva reduced levels of *Porphyromonas* and *Fusobacterium*.
In a control saliva sample, the addition of *P. gingivalis* led to an expansion of both *Porphyromonas* and *Fusobacterium*.
Berberine chloride was subsequently added to *P. gingivalis*-treated saliva at three doses: 15, 30, and 60 micrograms per milliliter.
*   *Porphyromonas* levels were almost instantly reduced in the presence of berberine, even at the lowest dose.
*   *Fusobacterium* levels were reduced at medium and higher doses of berberine in the spiked saliva sample.

## Personal Microbiome Test Results (Test 4)

Adding berberine to the homemade mouthwash for oral microbiome test number four yielded unexpected results:
*   **P. gingivalis:** Levels returned to zero, similar to test number two, though it is uncertain if this reduction was directly attributable to berberine.
*   **F. nucleatum & T. forsythia:** Both bacteria showed a dramatic expansion, significantly above levels observed in the first three tests. Their combined sum constituted 17.2% of all salivary bacteria.
    *   This represents an 8.6-fold increase for *Fusobacterium nucleatum* and *Tannerella forsythia* with berberine in the homemade mouthwash, relative to the three-test average of 2%.

## Hypothesis for Test 4 Results

The adverse outcome for *F. nucleatum* and *T. forsythia* may be due to an excessively high concentration of berberine in the homemade mouthwash.
*   The in vitro study's highest effective dose was 60 micrograms per milliliter of berberine.
*   The personal scale used for measurement has a lower limit of 100 milligrams.
*   If 100 milligrams of berberine were dissolved in one liter of water for the mouthwash, this would equate to 100 micrograms per milliliter – a concentration higher than the maximum dose used in the successful in vitro study.
*   It is plausible that the berberine concentration was overshot.
*   Consequently, berberine has been removed from the mouthwash formulation.

## Future Strategy

Despite years of daily toothbrushing and flossing, and the use of a homemade mouthwash (which included xylitol, sodium bicarbonate, and peppermint oil), the salivary microbiome still requires improvement, particularly concerning *P. gingivalis*, *F. nucleatum*, and *T. forsythia*.

There is currently no control data from using no mouthwash for any of the first four tests, making it difficult to assess the mouthwash's standalone impact.

Recognizing that salivary bacteria can originate from below the gum line and that string flossing may not be sufficient for dislodging subgingival bacteria, new tools will be implemented. Salivary bacteria can also originate from the tongue.

**New Oral Hygiene Protocol for Test 5:**
*   Daily toothbrushing
*   Daily tongue scraping
*   Daily Waterpik use

Test number five will evaluate the impact of this combined protocol on the salivary microbiome.
