# 2024-12-01 Conquer Aging Or Die Trying Podcast Episode 5 - Crissman Loomis @Unaging.Crissman.Loomis

## Executive Summary

*   **Walking as the Top Longevity Intervention:** Consistently walking approximately 12,000 steps daily offers the most significant reduction in all-cause mortality, estimated at over 75%, and can add up to seven years of life.
*   **Tiered Longevity Interventions:** Interventions are categorized into tiers (S, A, B, C, D) based on their impact on all-cause mortality, with physical activities and avoiding smoking dominating the top tiers.
*   **Calorie Restriction Nuance in Humans:** While calorie restriction shows benefits in smaller animals, its application and optimal magnitude in humans are debated, with evidence suggesting that very low BMIs (around 18) are associated with increased all-cause mortality in humans, and that the focus should be on achieving a youthful biomarker profile rather than absolute caloric restriction.
*   **Biomarker Optimization vs. Habit Changes:** While habit changes (like diet and exercise) form the foundation, optimizing biomarkers through careful tracking and intervention can potentially offer further gains, especially for individuals already engaged in healthy habits, though the magnitude of benefit from fine-tuning is debated.
*   **The Unaging Challenge:** A structured, year-long, community-based challenge aims to improve physical fitness through four progressive stages: aerobic/HIIT, strength training, mobility/walking, and a personalized peak challenge, with measurable outcomes for participants.

*   **Red Peppers (1 whole pepper once every 1-2 weeks):** Significant longevity benefits.
*   **Garlic, Turmeric, Spices:** Similar benefits to red peppers.
*   **Brushing Teeth (daily):** Daily brushing provides longevity benefits.
*   **Instant Coffee:** Provides caffeine benefit, but polyethanol benefits may be reduced.

### Neutral Impact

*   **Refined Grains (e.g., white bread):** No negative or positive impact on lifespan.
*   **Poultry:** Neutral protein source.

## Calorie Restriction in Humans

The efficacy and optimal approach to calorie restriction (CR) in humans are complex and debated, with research suggesting differences between animal models and human physiology.

*   **Animal Studies vs. Human Physiology:**
    *   CR has shown lifespan extension in certain animal models (yeast, fruit flies, mice).
    *   However, studies suggest that in mice, CR benefits are most pronounced in smaller, lighter individuals and may not apply equally across all strains or those recently introduced to labs.
    *   Humans, compared to other animals, live significantly longer than expected for their body weight.
*   **Human Data on Body Weight and Longevity:**
    *   Individuals with very low BMIs (around 18) are associated with a 50% higher all-cause mortality risk compared to those with a normal BMI (20-25).
    *   This suggests that extreme leanness due to CR is detrimental in humans.
*   **Biomarker-Driven Approach to CR:**
    *   Instead of absolute CR, the focus may be on achieving a body weight and composition associated with optimal biomarker profiles indicative of youth and low all-cause mortality risk (termed "CRON-B" - Calorie Restriction with Optimal Nutrition and Biomarkers).
    *   This involves tracking biomarkers (e.g., glucose, RDW, lymphocytes, hs-CRP) over time to identify an individual's optimal calorie intake that supports youthful biomarker status without negatively impacting other health indicators.
*   **Potential Benefits of Moderate CR:**
    *   Personal data suggests that moderate CR (around 20-25% reduction from ad lib intake) correlates with improvements in several biomarkers (e.g., lower hs-CRP, RDW, uric acid, systolic blood pressure; higher lymphocytes).
    *   The goal is to slow the rate of aging-related biomarker changes rather than solely achieving the lowest possible calorie intake.
*   **GLP-1 Activation:**
    *   Activating GLP-1, a satiety hormone, may be a key mechanism for CR benefits.
    *   This can be achieved through a high soluble fiber diet, which promotes gut bacteria to produce short-chain fatty acids that activate GLP-1.
    *   Excessive supplemental soluble fiber might pose risks (e.g., liver cell damage).

## Biomarker Tuning vs. Habit Changes

The discussion highlights the potential role of optimizing biomarkers in addition to fundamental healthy habits.

*   **Habit Changes as Foundation:** Diet and exercise are considered the primary drivers of health and longevity.
*   **Biomarker Tuning for Fine-Gains:** For individuals already practicing healthy habits, fine-tuning biomarkers may offer additional improvements.
    *   **Example: Glucose Levels:** While reference ranges exist, tracking glucose trends and aiming for youthful levels (e.g., 80-94) can be beneficial. Extremely low glucose (e.g., 74 with HbA1c of 4.5) may indicate underlying issues, suggesting that optimal ranges are nuanced and influenced by factors like liver function.
    *   **Rate of Change:** Monitoring the rate at which biomarkers change over time is crucial. A consistent upward trend in glucose, even within normal ranges, may indicate aging-related metabolic decline.
    *   **Epigenetic Clocks (e.g., Dunedin Pace):** These methylation-based tests aim to measure the pace of epigenetic aging. While promising, their responsiveness to diet and exercise in well-nourished individuals is still under investigation. Some research suggests that diet and exercise may not significantly impact epigenetic markers in certain populations.
    *   **Personalized Data:** Individual data collection and analysis are key to understanding personal responses to interventions and optimizing biomarker profiles.
*   **Caution on Overtuning:** It's important to distinguish between treating significant health issues (e.g., high glucose, blood pressure) and fine-tuning biomarkers within already acceptable ranges, where the incremental benefit may be minimal.

## The Unaging Challenge 2025 Update

The Unaging Challenge is a year-long program designed to improve participants' health through structured challenges, fostering a community approach.

*   **Challenge Structure:** Four distinct challenges spread over a year:
    1.  Aerobic and High-Intensity Interval Training.
    2.  Strength Training.
    3.  Mobility and Walking.
    4.  Personal Peak (self-designed focus).
*   **Current Progress (Strength Training):**
    *   20 early adopters are currently participating in the strength training phase.
    *   Participants are measured on metrics like one-repetition maximum (1RM) to track progress.
    *   **Results:**
        *   Trained individuals gained approximately 10% in strength.
        *   Untrained individuals experienced beginner gains of around 40-60% over the 12-week challenge.
*   **2025 Challenge Registration:** Open registration for the 2025 challenge is available and free.
*   **Community and Measurement:** The challenge emphasizes community support, shared information, and measurable outcomes to encourage progress.

## Additional Considerations Mentioned

*   **Leanness:** Maintaining a lean body composition is beneficial, with weight loss even a few pounds yielding immediate metabolic benefits.
*   **Sleep:** While important, its intervention value is considered moderate compared to other factors.
*   **Sunlight Exposure:** Mentioned as a potential factor, though not detailed in the tiers.
*   **Air Quality and Water Purity:** Identified as factors that could be added to longevity discussions.
*   **Social Contact/Loneliness:** Recognized as having a significant impact on longevity, but difficult to quantify.
*   **Stress:** Another significant factor that is hard to quantify for longevity impact.
*   **Genetics and Longevity:** While genetics play a role, the focus is on optimizing what can be controlled through lifestyle and interventions.
*   **Rejuvenation Technologies:** The long-term goal for some is to "live long enough to live forever" by leveraging future rejuvenation technologies.
