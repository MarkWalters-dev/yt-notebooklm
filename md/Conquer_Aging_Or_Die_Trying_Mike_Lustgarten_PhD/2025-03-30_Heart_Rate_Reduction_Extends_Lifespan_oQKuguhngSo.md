# 2025-03-30 Heart Rate Reduction Extends Lifespan

## Executive Summary

*   A meta-analysis of 46 studies involving over 1.2 million people found that a resting heart rate of 45 beats per minute (bpm) was significantly associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality.
*   Each 10 bpm increase in resting heart rate above 45 bpm was associated with a 9% increased risk of all-cause mortality.
*   The medication ivabradine effectively reduced heart rate by a significant 14% over the lifespan of male mice compared to controls.
*   This ivabradine-induced heart rate reduction led to a significant 6% increase in median lifespan for treated mice, extending it from 906 days to 962 days.
*   A 6% lifespan extension in mice, if translatable to humans, could correspond to approximately an additional five years of life based on an 80-year average human lifespan.

## Human Correlational Data

A meta-analysis of 46 studies, including more than 1,200,000 people, investigated the relationship between resting heart rate and all-cause mortality risk.
*   A resting heart rate of 45 beats per minute was significantly associated with the lowest risk of death for all causes.
*   As resting heart rate increased by 10 beats per minute, there was a significant 9% increased risk of death for all causes.
    *   For example, individuals with a 55 bpm resting heart rate had a 9% higher risk of death compared to those with 45 bpm.
    *   Individuals with a 65 bpm resting heart rate had an 18% higher risk of death compared to those with 45 bpm.
*   This association indicates that all-cause mortality risk progressively increases as resting heart rate increases.

## Mouse Data: Ivabradine and Heart Rate

To investigate a causal link between heart rate reduction and lifespan, a study was conducted using the medication ivabradine in mice. Ivabradine is known to reduce heart rate.
*   Ivabradine-treated mice exhibited a significantly lower heart rate at almost all time points throughout their lifespan compared to control mice.
*   The reduction in heart rate was a significant 14% (p < 0.01) for the duration of their lifespan.

## Mouse Data: Ivabradine and Lifespan Extension

The study further examined whether this ivabradine-induced heart rate reduction impacted lifespan.
*   The study included 150 male mice. (The translation of these effects to female mice is currently unclear.)
*   Control mice had a median lifespan of 906 days, which is considered long-lived for the control strain (C57BL/6 mice typically have a median lifespan around 900 days).
*   Ivabradine-treated mice had a median lifespan of 962 days.
*   This represents a significant 6% longer median lifespan compared to control mice.
*   A 6% increase in lifespan, if translated to an 80-year human lifespan, would equate to approximately a five-year extension (from 80 to 85 years).
*   The lifespan increase in ivabradine-treated mice (962 days) exceeded 950 days, which is considered a robust median lifespan extension based on established longevity research guidelines.
*   The study concluded that decreasing heart rate throughout the lifespan increases lifespan, at least in mice.

### Study Design Considerations

Effective lifespan studies in mice typically adhere to specific guidelines to ensure robust and reliable results:
*   **Sufficient Sample Size:** Studies should include a substantial number of mice per group (e.g., 75 mice per group in this study, or frequently at least 50 mice per group in Interventions Testing Program (ITP) studies, or over 150 mice per group in some studies). Small sample sizes (e.g., 10 per group) may be underpowered to detect significant effects and may not be representative of population-based averages.
*   **Healthy Control Strain:** The control group mice should have a healthy and appropriate median lifespan for their strain (e.g., around 900 days for C57BL/6 mice). If control mice have a shorter lifespan (e.g., 750 days), an intervention that brings them to 900 days might be correcting an environmental defect rather than truly extending lifespan.

## Implications and Future Questions

While mouse data suggests a causal link between heart rate reduction and increased lifespan, the broader question remains:
*   Will reducing human heart rate to relatively low levels (e.g., 45 bpm or lower), whether through lifestyle factors (leanness, fitness) or medical interventions (medications, supplements), increase human lifespan?
