# 2025-10-12 What s The Biochemistry Of Fitness In 80yr Olds

## Executive Summary

*   Muscle mass and strength peak around 30 years old, declining thereafter. This decline is associated with reduced survival and quality of life, highlighting the importance of strategies to maintain function.
*   A study on octogenarians identified distinct serum metabolomic profiles linked to high versus low physical function, measured by VO2 peak and walking speed, despite potential high interpersonal variability.
*   Higher physical function in 80-year-olds correlated with elevated levels of specific metabolites, including phosphatidylcholines (biomarkers of omega-3 index), lysophosphatidylcholines (biomarkers of mitochondrial function), tryptophan, sphingomyelins, ceramide, and glycine.
*   Conversely, lower physical function was associated with higher levels of metabolites such as the amino acid cysteine and its oxidation product cystine, linoleic acid, gut-derived indoxyl sulfate and paracresol sulfate, and specific phosphatidylcholines and triglycerides.
*   Longitudinal personal metabolomic data (over 2+ years) revealed stability for 48 out of 54 key function-associated metabolites, with three beneficial metabolites showing an increase, while three detrimental metabolites (indoxyl sulfate, paracresol sulfate, and one phosphatidylcholine) increased, suggesting specific targets for biochemical optimization.

## The Age-Related Decline of Muscle Function

Muscle mass and function typically peak around 30 years of age, followed by a gradual decline. A faster rate of decline can lead to sarcopenia, while a slower rate is considered normal aging. Maintaining higher levels of muscle mass and strength is associated with increased survival and a better quality of life. The goal of optimizing biochemistry is to flatten this age-related curve, preventing the decline in muscle mass, strength, and function. Aging is a multi-decade biochemical process, so understanding the underlying biochemistry of fitness at older ages is crucial.

## Metabolomic Signatures of Fitness in Octogenarians

A recent study investigated serum proteomic and metabolomic signatures in octogenarians (80-year-olds) to identify biochemical differences between high and low physical function.

### Study Design and Participants

The study included 80-year-olds, with approximately equal numbers of men and women, divided into three groups based on physical function:
*   High functioning
*   Normal functioning
*   Low functioning

### Measures of Physical Function

Participants' physical function was assessed using three metrics:
*   **Walking speed:** Significantly differed between groups.
*   **Grip strength:** No significant difference between groups.
*   **VO2 peak:** Significantly differed between groups. The high-functioning group included master's athletes.

**VO2 Peak and Walking Speed in Study Groups:**
*   **High-Functioning Group:** VO2 peak 32 mL O2/min/kg; Walking Speed 1.6 m/s
*   **Normal-Functioning Group:** VO2 peak 20 mL O2/min/kg; Walking Speed 1.25 m/s
*   **Low-Functioning Group:** VO2 peak 16.5 mL O2/min/kg; Walking Speed 0.83 m/s

The high-functioning group exhibited approximately double the VO2 peak compared to the low-functioning group, with corresponding differences in walking speed.

## Metabolites Associated with Physical Function

The study identified numerous metabolites associated with physical function in 80-year-olds. A positive beta coefficient indicated that higher levels of a metabolite were associated with higher physical function, while a negative beta coefficient indicated that higher levels were associated with worse physical function.

### Metabolites Associated with Better Physical Function

Several metabolite groups and individual compounds showed a positive correlation with physical function:

*   **Phosphatidylcholines (PCs):**
    *   PC C36:5 and PC C38:6 were specifically identified. These are known biomarkers of the omega-3 index, with higher levels associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk. Their association with better physical function suggests a broader role.
    *   Many other phosphatidylcholines were also positively correlated.
*   **Lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPCs):**
    *   LysoPC C18:2 was noted, along with many other lysoPCs. These are biomarkers of mitochondrial function, indicating that better mitochondrial function is linked to higher physical function.
*   **Sphingomyelins (SMs):** A group of lipids that may be linked to neurodegenerative disease.
*   **Amino Acid Tryptophan:** Higher plasma levels were significantly associated with better physical function, particularly evident when comparing the lowest and highest functioning groups.
*   **Ceramide**
*   **Glycine**

These 44 metabolites consistently showed positive beta coefficients and adjusted P-values less than 0.05, indicating significant associations with higher physical function.

### Metabolites Associated with Worse Physical Function

Several metabolites showed a negative correlation with physical function:

*   **Amino Acids:**
    *   Cysteine
    *   Cystine (oxidation product of cysteine)
*   **Fatty Acid:** Linoleic acid (18 carbons, 2 double bonds)
*   **Gut Bacterial Derived Metabolites:**
    *   Indoxyl sulfate (Ind SO4): Higher levels were found in the lowest functioning group and significantly lower levels in the higher functioning group.
    *   Paracresol sulfate
*   **Phosphatidylcholines (PCs):** Two specific PCs were associated with worse function, indicating not all PCs are beneficial.
*   **Triglycerides:** Two specific triglyceride metabolites were identified.

These 8 metabolites consistently showed negative beta coefficients and adjusted P-values less than 0.05, indicating significant associations with worse physical function.

## Personal Metabolomics Data: Tryptophan and Indoxyl Sulfate

Longitudinal personal data over a 2+ year period (2023-2025) was analyzed for key metabolites:

### Tryptophan Levels

*   **2023 Average:** 28 micromolar (5 tests)
*   **2024 Average:** 32 micromolar (9 tests)
*   **2025 Average:** 27 micromolar (5 tests)

Statistical comparison using two-sample t-tests (P-value < 0.05 for significance):
*   2023 vs. 2024: P = 0.19 (not significantly different)
*   2024 vs. 2025: P = 0.17 (not significantly different)
*   2023 vs. 2025: P = 0.41 (not significantly different)

**Conclusion:** Plasma tryptophan levels remained mostly stable over the 2+ year period. Since relatively higher tryptophan levels are associated with better physical function and tryptophan levels typically decline with age, maintaining stable levels suggests resistance to age-related decline.

### Indoxyl Sulfate Levels

*   **2023 Average:** 1.6 micromolar (5 tests)
*   **2024 Average:** 2.2 micromolar (9 tests)
*   **2025 Average:** 2.4 micromolar (5 tests)

Statistical comparison:
*   2023 vs. 2025: Indoxyl sulfate significantly increased, indicating a worsening trend.

**Conclusion:** Plasma indoxyl sulfate levels significantly increased over the 2+ year period, moving in the "wrong direction" as lower levels are associated with better physical function, and indoxyl sulfate typically increases with age.

## Comprehensive Metabolomic Profile Assessment

The plasma metabolome includes approximately 18,000 metabolites. While specific metabolites like glucose or cholesterol are found in high concentrations, two individual metabolites (like tryptophan or indoxyl sulfate) are unlikely to fully capture the complexity of physical function or aging. Ideally, the aim is to resist age-related changes across the entire metabolome, maintaining a biochemical profile closest to a youthful state.

Of the 56 metabolites identified in the octogenarian study as associated with physical function, 54 were tracked personally.

### Longitudinal Changes in Metabolites Associated with Better Function (44 total)

*   **Stability:** 40 of these 44 metabolites showed no significant difference when comparing 2023 with 2025, suggesting a stable biochemical profile potentially linked to stable physical function.
*   **Positive Trend:** Three metabolites showed a significant increase over the 2+ year period, which is considered a positive change since higher levels are associated with better physical function.
*   **Negative Trend:** One metabolite showed a significant decrease, which is a negative change for this group.

### Longitudinal Changes in Metabolites Associated with Worse Function (8 total)

*   **Stability:** Seven of these eight metabolites showed no significant difference when comparing 2023 with 2025.
*   **Negative Trend:** Paracresol sulfate significantly increased from 2023 to 2025, moving in the "wrong direction" as higher levels are associated with worse physical function. Additionally, cysteine increased from 2024 to 2025, also a negative trend.
*   **Positive Trend:** One of the specific phosphatidylcholines associated with worse function showed a decline, which is a positive change.

### Overall Summary of Personal Metabolomic Changes

When examining the 54 tracked metabolites associated with physical function:
*   **Stability:** 48 metabolites showed no significant two-year change.
*   **Positive Changes:** Three metabolites (associated with better function) increased.
*   **Negative Changes:** Three metabolites showed detrimental increases:
    *   Indoxyl sulfate
    *   Paracresol sulfate
    *   One specific phosphatidylcholine (associated with the omega-3 index)

These findings highlight specific areas for targeted interventions to optimize the biochemical profile and potentially improve or maintain physical function.
