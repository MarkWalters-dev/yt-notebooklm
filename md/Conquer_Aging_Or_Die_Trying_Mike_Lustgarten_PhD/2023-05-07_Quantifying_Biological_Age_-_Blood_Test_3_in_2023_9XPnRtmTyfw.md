# 2023-05-07 Quantifying Biological Age - Blood Test 3 in 2023

## Executive Summary
*   The most recent blood test indicates a biological age of 34.2 years using Dr. Morgan Levine's Phenotypic Age calculator, which is 16 years younger than the chronological age.
*   Over 28 blood tests since 2018, the average biological age has trended downwards, with 2022 showing the lowest average at 33.8 years.
*   Using the aging.ai calculator, the predicted biological age is 33 years, 17.2 years younger than chronological age.
*   Historical aging.ai data shows an average age of 32 years from 2009-2014 and 29.8 years from 2016-2022.
*   Current areas identified for potential improvement include creatinine and glucose levels for the Levine test, and glucose, creatinine, triglycerides, and red blood cell count for the aging.ai test.

## Phenotypic Age Calculator (Dr. Morgan Levine)

*   **Most Recent Test (May 2023):**
    *   Biological Age: 34.2 years (16 years younger than chronological age)
    *   High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP): < 0.3 mg/dL (consistent for 10 consecutive tests)
*   **Historical Trends (2018-2023):**
    *   2018-2019 (3 tests): Average biological age of 36.1 years.
    *   2020-2021 (12 tests): Average biological age of 35.6 years.
    *   2022 (7 tests): Average biological age of 33.8 years.
    *   2023 (3 tests thus far): Average biological age of 33.3 years.
*   **Areas for Improvement:**
    *   Creatinine levels are higher than the 2015-present average of 0.95 mg/dL.
    *   Glucose levels have been in the 90s mg/dL for the second consecutive test.

## Aging.ai Calculator

*   **Most Recent Test (May 2023):**
    *   Predicted Biological Age: 33 years (17.2 years younger than chronological age)
*   **Historical Trends (2009-2022):**
    *   2009-2014 (3 tests over 5 years): Average aging.ai age of 32 years.
    *   2016-2022 (34 tests over 7 years): Average aging.ai age of 29.8 years.
*   **2023 Trend:**
    *   The most recent test of 33 years is higher than the first two tests in 2023 (28 and 27 years).
    *   However, all 2023 results (33, 28, 27 years) remain within the established range of 26-34 years since 2016.
    *   2023 average thus far (3 tests): 29.3 years.
*   **Areas for Improvement:**
    *   Glucose levels.
    *   Creatinine levels.
    *   Triglycerides (higher than the average since 2018).
    *   Red blood cell count (below the average of 4.85 million/µL).

## Investigating Interventions

*   **Serine + Vitamin B6 for Homocysteine:**
    *   **Protocol:**
        *   Serine: 2 grams per day.
        *   Vitamin B6: 11 milligrams per day (approximately 3.5 times higher than previous intake of 3 mg/day).
        *   Supplementation duration: 44 out of 49 days preceding the blood test.
    *   *Outcome on homocysteine levels will be discussed in a future video.*
*   **Vitamin B6, NAD, and DHEA Sulfate:**
    *   The impact of Vitamin B6 on blood NAD concentration and the subsequent effect on DHEA sulfate levels is being investigated.
    *   Blood samples for NAD quantification were sent to Genfinity and results are anticipated soon.
