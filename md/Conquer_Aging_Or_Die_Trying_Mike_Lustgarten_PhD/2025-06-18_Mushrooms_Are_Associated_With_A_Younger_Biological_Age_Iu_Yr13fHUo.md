# 2025-06-18 Mushrooms Are Associated With A Younger Biological Age

## Executive Summary

*   Higher mushroom intake is significantly correlated with a younger biological age, as measured by the PhenoAge clock.
*   This correlation persists even after adjusting for body weight, suggesting an independent association.
*   The data indicates a potential optimal intake range of 140 to 300 grams of mushrooms daily for a younger biological age, though causation is not established.
*   Mushrooms are rich in beneficial compounds such as spermidine and ergothioneine.

## Study Methodology

The study utilized data from 40 tests conducted between 2018 and 2025, employing the PhenoAge biological age clock.

*   **Biological Age Measurement:** PhenoAge clock, a clinical chemistry biomarker-based test (not epigenetic).
*   **Dietary Data Collection:**
    *   Food intake has been weighed and entered into the Cronometer diet tracking app since 2015.
    *   Data is then exported to a spreadsheet for analysis.
    *   Average daily intake for foods, including mushrooms, was recorded for each blood test.
*   **Body Weight Adjustment:** A linear regression model was used to assess the association of mushroom intake with biological age after accounting for body weight.

## Key Findings

### Mushroom Intake and Biological Age Correlation

*   A significant inverse correlation was observed between average daily mushroom intake and biological age.
*   **Correlation Coefficient (r):** -0.36
*   **P-value:** < 0.05, indicating statistical significance.
*   This means that a higher intake of mushrooms is associated with a younger biological age.

### Optimal Mushroom Intake Range (Observational)

*   Based on personal data, the range of mushroom intake that appeared most beneficial for a younger biological age was approximately 140 grams to 300 grams per day.
*   **Note:** This is an observational finding from a single individual's data and does not confirm causation.

### Association After Adjusting for Body Weight

*   A linear regression model was constructed including both mushroom intake and body weight as predictors of biological age.
*   Even after controlling for body weight, mushroom intake remained significantly and inversely associated with a younger biological age.
*   This suggests that the association between mushrooms and biological age may be independent of body weight.

## Potential Mechanisms and Future Directions

*   **Beneficial Compounds:** Mushrooms are recognized as a good source of spermidine, ergothioneine, and various polysaccharides, which may contribute to their health benefits.
*   **Causation vs. Correlation:** The current study design can only establish correlation and association. To test causation, one would hypothetically remove mushrooms from the diet and observe changes in biological age. However, given the observed benefits and the nutritional value of mushrooms, removing them is not planned.
*   **Generalizability:** The findings are based on one individual's data and may not be directly applicable to others.
*   **Recommendation:** The study encourages others to engage in regular diet tracking alongside blood testing to observe similar correlations in their own data.
