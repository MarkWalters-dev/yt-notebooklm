# 2024-06-30 Sulforaphane Extends Lifespan Increases Muscle Strength And Endurance

## Executive Summary
* Declining levels of the transcription factor Nrf2 are associated with aging; sulforaphane (SFN) increases Nrf2 expression significantly (nearly two-fold at 3 and 6 $\mu$M concentrations).
* SFN supplementation extended the lifespan of aged mice (21–22 weeks old), showing a statistically significant delay in the time point when 25% of the colony had died compared to controls.
* SFN improved physical performance in old mice: it increased grip hang time (muscle strength/endurance) and treadmill work (aerobic exercise capacity).
* Broccoli sprouts contain substantially more SFN (approximately 12 times more) than broccoli florets/stems combined.
* The optimal SFN content in broccoli sprouts occurs when harvested between 5 and 11 days post-germination, with seeds having the highest concentration.

## Nrf2 Expression and Aging

Aging is associated with a decline in the transcription factor Nrf2, which impacts several hallmarks of aging and age-associated diseases. Sulforaphane (SFN), found abundantly in broccoli sprouts, may reverse this age-related decline.

*   **Effect on Nrf2 Expression:**
    *   Comparing SFN concentrations of 0 $\mu$M, 3 $\mu$M, and 6 $\mu$M:
    *   SFN at 3 $\mu$M and 6 $\mu$M increased Nrf2 expression nearly two-fold compared to the control (0 $\mu$M).

## Sulforaphane Impact on Lifespan in Aged Mice

SFN was tested for its effect on the lifespan of aged mice (21–22 weeks old).

*   **Dosage:** 442.5 mg of sulforaphane per kilogram of food.
*   **Survival Analysis (75% survival milestone, i.e., when 25% of the colony has died):**
    *   **Control Diet:** 5 out of 20 mice had died.
    *   **SFN Diet:** 0 out of 20 mice had died (a statistically significant increase in survival at this time point).

## Improvement in Muscle Strength and Endurance

The study investigated whether SFN improved healthspan metrics in aged mice.

### Wire Hanging Test (Grip Strength and Endurance)
This test measures the time mice can hold onto a wire. Young mice were 2 months old; old mice were 21–22 weeks old.

*   **Young Mice:** SFN supplementation did not impact grip hang time.
*   **Old Mice:** SFN supplementation resulted in a significant increase in grip hang time compared to non-supplemented old mice.

### Treadmill Endurance Test (Aerobic Exercise Capacity)
Treadmill work was calculated to account for variations in body weight:
$$\text{Work} = \text{Force (Body Weight)} \times \text{Distance (Meters Run)}$$

*   **Young Mice:** SFN supplementation did not impact treadmill work.
*   **Old Mice:** SFN supplementation increased aerobic exercise capacity (treadmill work) compared to control old mice.

## SFN Content in Brassicas and Optimal Harvest Time

To determine a human equivalent dose (HED), the SFN content in broccoli versus broccoli sprouts was analyzed.

### Broccoli vs. Sprouts SFN Content
*   **Whole Broccoli (Average of florets and stems across two types):** Approximately 93 mg of SFN per 100 grams.
*   **Broccoli Sprouts:** Contained about 12 times more SFN when compared with whole broccoli.

### Impact of Germination Time on SFN Content
SFN content varies significantly based on the age of the sprouts harvested from seeds:

*   **Broccoli Seeds:** Contained the highest level (3,600 $\mu$g/g).
*   **5-Day Old Sprouts:** Content declined about 12-fold from the seed level.
*   **Optimal Harvest Window:** Highest SFN levels were observed in sprouts harvested between 5 and 11 days post-germination, reaching up to 1,500 $\mu$g/g after the initial decline post-day five.

## Human Equivalent Dose (HED) Calculation

The HED was calculated based on the mouse study that extended 25% survival (SFN dose: 442.5 mg/kg food).

1.  **Daily Mouse Food Intake:** 4 grams/day (0.004 kg/day).
2.  **Total Daily SFN Intake (Mouse):** $442.5 \text{ mg/kg} \times 0.004 \text{ kg/day} = 1.77 \text{ mg/day}$.
3.  **Conversion:** Divide by the mouse-to-human body surface area conversion factor (12.3).
4.  **Resulting HED:** $1.77 \text{ mg/day} / 12.3 \approx 144 \text{ mg of Sulforaphane per day}$.

### Whole Food Equivalent Dose
Based on the Lopez Cervantes study findings (where optimal sprouts contained $\approx 1 \text{ mg SFN/g}$):

*   To achieve the HED of 144 mg SFN/day, approximately **140 grams of optimally harvested broccoli sprouts** should be consumed daily.

## Biological Rationale and Future Aims

SFN increases Nrf2 expression, which increases antioxidant defense enzymes. Oxidative stress is known to limit telomere length, suggesting SFN supplementation may help extend telomere length or slow its shortening as estimated by DNA methylation testing.
