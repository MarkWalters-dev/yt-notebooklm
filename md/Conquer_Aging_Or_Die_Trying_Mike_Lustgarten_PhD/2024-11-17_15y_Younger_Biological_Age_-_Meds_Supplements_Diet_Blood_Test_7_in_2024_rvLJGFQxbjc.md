# 2024-11-17 15y Younger Biological Age - Meds Supplements Diet Blood Test 7 in 2024

## Executive Summary
*   Blood Test 7 in 2024 revealed a biological age 15.2 years younger than chronological age, as calculated by the PhenoAge model.
*   Thyroid medication (Levothyroxine) is a necessary daily prescription, while Rapamycin was briefly experimented with for antifungal properties but was discontinued due to lack of impact on Candida antibodies.
*   Supplementation with Vitamin D and low-dose Nicotinic Acid contributed to maintaining NAD+ levels.
*   Dietary experiments involved increasing strawberries, sardines, low-fat yogurt, oranges, and cacao beans, while decreasing flaxseeds and adding oysters.
*   The diet was 99% clean, with junk calories constituting only 1.2% of the total intake.

## Prescription Medications

*   **Levothyroxine:** 137.5 mcg daily, taken for hypothyroidism diagnosed in mid-twenties.
*   **Rapamycin:** 1 mg daily for 7 days was trialed to assess its impact on elevated Candida IgG antibodies. This experiment occurred approximately one month prior to the blood test period, making a direct impact unlikely. The trial was unsuccessful in lowering Candida antibodies and the medication has been discontinued for now.

## Supplements

*   **Vitamin D:** Supplemented for 8-9 months out of the year due to limited sun exposure in Boston. Used for all 49 days corresponding to Test 7.
*   **Nicotinic Acid:** 50-60 mg daily for 36 out of the 49 days corresponding to Test 7.
    *   **NAD+ Measurement:** On October 25th (Test 7 day), NAD+ levels were 31.7 micromolar.
    *   **Comparison to Test 6:** For Test 6, Nicotinic Acid was taken for 28 out of 42 days, resulting in NAD+ levels of 21.1 micromolar on the test day.
    *   **Impact of Precursor Timing:** NAD+ levels are sensitive to precursor intake for at least 5 days prior to testing.

## Diet

The following dietary composition corresponds to the 49-day period leading up to Test 7. All food weights were measured and entered into Cronometer for accurate tracking.

### Food Intake (Ranked by Grams)
*   Strawberries: Increased from 319g to 510g daily.
*   Sardines: Increased from 107g to 143g daily.
*   Low-fat Yogurt: Increased from an average of 8g to 117g daily.
*   Oranges: Added from 0g to 35g daily.
*   Cacao Beans: Increased from 1g to 12g daily.
*   Flaxseeds: Decreased from 26g to 16g daily.
*   Oysters: Added as one 165g can per week.
*   Green Tea: Measured in ounces.
*   Ice Cream: Included as a cheat meal.
*   Popcorn: Included as a cheat meal.

### Dietary Experiments for Test 7:
*   **Strawberries:** Increased intake to improve overall biomarker data that was not optimal when fructose intake was reduced.
*   **Sardines:** Increased intake to test correlations with Horvath's epigenetic age and homocysteine.
*   **Low-fat Yogurt:** Increased intake to test correlation with nighttime respiratory rate (a biomarker of immune activation).
*   **Oranges:** Added to test correlation with DHEA sulfate.
*   **Cacao Beans:** Increased intake due to correlation with lower MCV (a component of PhenoAge) and lipoprotein a.
*   **Flaxseeds:** Decreased intake as a source of gamma-tocopherol, which in this data is correlated with higher lipoprotein a.
*   **Oysters:** Added for zinc content, aiming to impact Candida IgG levels and taurine.
*   **Sugar:** 40g added on one day post-test to a blend of macadamia nuts, cacao beans, and dates.
*   **Ice Cream Sandwiches (Frozen Dessert):** Included as a cheat meal.
*   **Homemade Ice Cream:** Made with heavy whipping cream for consumption post-Test 7.

### Cheat Meals and Junk Calories
*   **Junk Calories Total:** 1215 calories.
    *   Ice cream sandwiches: 840 calories.
    *   Popcorn: 220 calories.
    *   Added sugar: 155 calories.
*   **Percentage of Total Calories:** 1.2%. The diet was 99% clean.
*   **Cheat Meal Strategy:** Implemented for 2-3 days immediately following blood testing to maintain adherence to the clean diet for the remaining period.

8.  Beets (New to top 10)
9.  Coconut Butter (New to top 10)
10. Pistachios (New to top 10)

*   Seven of the top 10 foods remained consistent with Test 6.
*   Foods that entered the top 10: Beets, Coconut Butter, Pistachios.
*   Foods that left the top 10: Corn, Oats, Chickpeas (reduced for an experiment on total fat intake).

### Macronutrient Composition
*   **Average Daily Calorie Intake:** 2130 calories.
*   **Protein:** 102 grams (19% of total calories).
*   **Fat:** 89.5 grams (38% of total calories).
    *   Increased from 82g for Test 6.
    *   The increase was primarily from saturated fat in cacao beans (approx. 7g increase).
    *   Flaxseed reduction led to lower omega-3 intake (8.4g vs 9.5g).
    *   Monounsaturated fat intake was 5g less than the previous test.
*   **Carbohydrates:**
    *   **Total Carbs:** 265 grams per day.
    *   **Fiber:** 79 grams per day.
    *   **Net Carbs:** 188 grams per day (35% of total calories).
    *   **Calories from Fiber Fermentation:** 166 calories (8% of total calories converted to fat).
*   **Net Macros:** 46% Fat, 35% Net Carbs, 19% Protein.
*   **Total Fructose Intake:** 58 grams per day. This is not the lowest intake but represents progress from higher historical levels.

### Micronutrients
*   **General Coverage:** Full Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) coverage for all vitamins and minerals is maintained.
*   **Choline:** Appears low in Cronometer due to missing data for sardines. Manually adding this data brings it to RDA levels. Plasma levels from the IOLO Metaboloma Kit are not low, indicating adequate intake.
*   **Elevated Micronutrients:** Many micronutrients are consumed at levels significantly higher than the RDA, based on correlations with biomarkers.
    *   **Carotenoids:** Higher intake of alpha and beta carotene, beta cryptoxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, and lycopene is associated with younger epigenetic age in some studies.
