# 2025-04-22 22y Younger Biological Age - Supplements Diet Blood Test 2 in 2025

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age, as measured by the PhenoAge calculator, was found to be 22 years younger than chronological age.
*   Levothyroxine, taken for hypothyroidism, was a significant factor. Vitamin D and nicotinic acid supplementation were also part of the protocol.
*   Dietary experiments included reducing arabinoxylan-containing foods (flaxseeds, corn) to address Candida IgG, increasing walnut intake for higher fat, and reducing beet intake to test nitrate redundancy.
*   Macronutrient composition for the 42-day period leading up to the test was approximately 49% fat, 32% net carbs, and 19% protein, with an average daily calorie intake of 2167.
*   Micronutrient intake, particularly Vitamin K, was significantly above recommended daily allowances, driven by observed correlations with biomarkers.

## Prescription Medications

*   **Levothyroxine:**
    *   Dosage for this test: 137.5 micrograms per day.
    *   Condition: Hypothyroidism, diagnosed in early twenties.
    *   Note: Dose was later reduced, with an increase in liothyronine (T3), the effects of which will be assessed in a future blood test.

## Supplements

*   **Vitamin D:**
    *   Dosage: 2000 IU per day.
    *   Duration: 42 days, from February 4, 2025, to March 17, 2025.
    *   Context: Consistent supplementation for 8-9 months per year in Boston due to lower sun exposure; plans to increase sun exposure after moving to Austin, Texas.

*   **Nicotinic Acid:**
    *   Purpose: To raise NAD+ levels.
    *   Average NAD+ range without supplementation: 20-30 micromolar, with an average around 25 micromolar.
    *   Dosage for this test: 100 milligrams per day for 7 days prior to NAD+ measurement.
    *   Measurement: NAD+ levels were measured on March 18, 2025.
    *   Result: NAD+ levels reached 43 micromolar in response to 100 mg/day of nicotinic acid.
    *   Note: Higher doses (600 mg/day) previously resulted in NAD+ levels in the 60s micromolar but caused severe flushing. Current dose of 100 mg/day is considered a balance.

## Diet Composition

*   **Methodology:**
    *   All food was weighed and logged into Cronometer for accurate daily intake tracking.
    *   Data presented is a 42-day average leading up to the blood test.

*   **Dietary Experiments and Rationale:**

    1.  **Reducing Candida IgG:**
        *   **Problem:** Candida IgG has been elevated for nine consecutive tests; potential symptoms include fungal infections and eczema.
        *   **Hypothesis:** Candida can grow on glucose and arabinoxylan fiber.
        *   **Intervention:** Reduced intake of arabinoxylan-containing foods (flaxseeds and corn).
            *   Flaxseed intake: Reduced from 13 grams/day (Test 1) to 3 grams/day.
            *   Corn intake: Reduced by approximately half, from 76 grams/day to 38 grams/day.
            *   Pre-test period: Complete elimination (zero intake) of flaxseeds and corn for 29 days before testing.

    2.  **Increasing Fat Intake and Reducing Net Carbs:**
        *   **Purpose:** To test the hypothesis that Candida can grow on sugar.
        *   **Intervention:** Increased fat intake primarily from whole food sources, specifically walnuts.
            *   Walnut intake: Increased from 10 grams/day (Test 1) to 45 grams/day.
        *   **Impact:** Higher fat intake did not have major negative impacts on biomarkers. This approach is planned for future tests.

    3.  **Reducing Beet Intake:**
        *   **Rationale:** To assess if beet intake (for nitrates) was redundant given high collard green intake (also rich in nitrates).
        *   **Intervention:** Reduced beet intake significantly.
            *   Beet intake: Reduced from 265 grams/day (Test 1) to 11 grams/day.
        *   **Observations:**
            *   No negative impact on blood pressure, which is measured daily.
            *   Beets contain significant sucrose, fructose, and oxalates.
            *   Majority of biomarkers did not worsen with reduced beet intake.
        *   **Decision:** Beets will remain at a low level for now, with potential reintroduction to assess specific biomarker improvements.

    4.  **Reducing Onion Intake:**
        *   **Rationale:** To mitigate gas issues caused by onions, despite their inulin content (prebiotic).
        *   **Intervention:** Reduced onion intake.
            *   Onion intake: Reduced from 14 grams/day to 4 grams/day.

    5.  **Doubling Kimchi Intake:**
        *   **Rationale:** To balance the reduction in onion intake and potentially support gut health with probiotics.
        *   **Intervention:** Doubled kimchi intake.
        *   **Assessment:** Impact on gut health is pending iolo metabolomic results.

*   **Cheat Meals and Calorie Intake:**
    *   **Approach:** Incorporating cheat meals rather than complete elimination to avoid binge-purge cycles.
    *   **Incident:** A 5,700 calorie day occurred on day two after blood testing, involving peanut butter, chocolate, and grape jelly, stemming from an initial cookie consumption.
    *   **Calorie Breakdown of Junk Food:**
        *   Cookie dough: ~2200 calories
        *   Chocolate chips: ~900 calories
        *   Grape jam/jelly: ~600 calories
        *   Total junk calories: ~3700 calories
    *   **Junk Calorie Percentage:** 4% of total calories for the test period.
    *   **Goal:** Minimize recurrence of such high-calorie days and aim for less than 1-2% junk calories in the total diet.

*   **Top Calorie Contributors (Average Daily Intake):**
    *   Walnuts (ranked first, replacing sardines).
    *   Eight of the top 10 foods were consistent with Test 1.
    *   Foods that entered the top 10: Walnuts, wild-caught salmon.
    *   Foods that left the top 10: Beets, yogurt.

## Macronutrient and Body Weight Analysis

*   **Average Daily Calorie Intake:** 2167 calories per day. This is a relatively high intake compared to previous tests, reflecting an effort to maintain weight stability.

*   **Body Weight Trends:**
    *   **Age-Related Decline:** Body weight and BMI typically peak midlife and decline thereafter, potentially due to factors like cancer cachexia.
    *   **Personal Tracking (August 2018 - March 2025):**
        *   Consistent weight reduction achieved through calorie restriction starting January 2021.
        *   Current weight maintenance strategy aims to avoid unintentional weight loss trends.
        *   Recent slight increase in body weight followed by a decrease, with a target of staying around 140 lbs.
        *   Lower body weight (<140 lbs) has been observed to negatively impact workout performance and lead to muscle/strength loss.
    *   **Future Calorie Intake:** Increased to approximately 2200 calories per day for the next test to ensure weight stability.

*   **Macronutrient Composition (Net Macros):**
    *   **Fat:** 49% of total calories (106 grams per day). This is a moderate increase from the usual 25-30% range, driven by walnut consumption. Total fat intake is not the highest recorded since 2015, and levels around 44% appear to be beneficial for current biomarkers.
    *   **Net Carbohydrates:** 32% of total calories (174 grams per day).
        *   Total carbs: 242 grams per day.
        *   Fiber intake: 68 grams per day.
    *   **Protein:** 19% of total calories (101 grams per day).

*   **Fiber and Short-Chain Fatty Acids:**
    *   Approximately 20% of fiber is fermented by gut bacteria into short-chain fatty acids, contributing about 5% of total calories.
    *   Fiber intake was slightly reduced compared to the previous test (from 7.2% contribution to 5%).
    *   Shift to higher fat intake has improved symptoms of internal hemorrhoids.

*   **Fructose Intake:**
    *   Total fructose intake: 53 grams per day.
    *   This is within the lower range of historical intake (up to 122 grams per day since 2015).

## Micronutrient Intake

*   **Goal:** Achieve full Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) coverage for all vitamins and minerals.
*   **Optimization:** Intake levels above RDA are guided by correlations with biomarker data.
*   **Vitamin K:** Intake is approximately 25 times higher than the adequate intake for men (90 micrograms), based on observed correlations with a panel of biomarkers.
*   **Patreon Content:** Detailed information on biomarker correlations and optimal ranges is available on Patreon.

## Future Directions and Data Analysis

*   **NAD+ Metabolite:** Potential impact of another dietary nutrient on NAD+ levels will be explored in an upcoming video.
*   **Candida IgG:** Further assessment of the effectiveness of dietary changes on Candida IgG levels.
*   **Biomarker Optimization:** Continuous effort to optimize weak spots without compromising the overall dietary approach.
