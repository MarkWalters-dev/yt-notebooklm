# 2025-04-13 22y Younger Biological Age Blood Test 2 In 2025

## Executive Summary

*   **Biological Age:** The subject's biological age, calculated using Dr. Morgan Levine's PhenoAge algorithm, was 29.8 years in March 2025, indicating it is 22 years younger than chronological age. An earlier test in February 2025 showed a biological age of 31.1 years (20.9 years younger).
*   **PhenoAge Trend Over Time:** Over a ten-year period (2018-2025), the subject has successfully resisted an age-related increase in PhenoAge. Despite an expected increase of 0.9 years per chronological year (which would predict a PhenoAge of ~38 years by 2025 if starting at 34 in 2020), the average biological age for 2025 is currently 30.5 years.
*   **RDW Optimization:** Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW), a significant predictor of biological age, was significantly reduced over a decade (correlation -0.67, p<0.05). This contrasts with the natural age-related increase in RDW, with lower levels generally considered optimal based on all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Calorie Intake & RDW:** Calorie intake was strongly correlated with RDW (0.74, p<0.05), suggesting a role in influencing RDW levels.
*   **Glucose Management:** While 86% of glucose readings (49 out of 57 tests) were within the optimal range (80-94 mg/dL), a weak, non-significant increasing trend with chronological age (p=0.07) was observed over 10 years. Recent average glucose levels (87.5 mg/dL for the last two tests) are close to earlier best data (86 mg/dL), suggesting potential to flatten this age-related trend.

## Biological Age Assessment (PhenoAge)

Using Dr. Morgan Levine's PhenoAge biological age calculator, the biological age was determined to be 29.8 years in March 2025, which is 22 years younger than chronological age. This measurement is consistent with an earlier test on February 4, 2025, where the biological age was 31.1 years, approximately 20.9 years younger than chronological age. The current calculation utilizes the official corrected PhenoAge algorithm.

## PhenoAge Trends Over Time

The data for PhenoAge tracking began in 2018, as this was when high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a required biomarker for the PhenoAge calculation, started to be consistently included in blood tests. Over the years, testing frequency has increased to better evaluate year-to-year changes and inform interventions.

**PhenoAge Testing Frequency and Average Biological Age:**

*   **2018-2019:** 3 tests (average PhenoAge: 34.3 years)
*   **2020:** 6 tests (average PhenoAge: 33.9 years)
*   **2021:** 6 tests (average PhenoAge: 33.9 years)
*   **2022:** 7 tests (average PhenoAge: 32.1 years - best to date)
*   **2023:** 7 tests (average PhenoAge: 32.9 years)
*   **2024:** 8 tests (average PhenoAge: 33.1 years)
*   **2025 (first 2 tests):** Average PhenoAge: 30.5 years

PhenoAge typically increases by 0.9 years per chronological year, even if individual biomarkers remain constant. Based on an average PhenoAge of approximately 34 years from 2018-2021, the expected PhenoAge in 2025 would be at least 38 years. However, the current average for 2025 stands significantly lower at 30.5 years, indicating a successful resistance to an age-related biological age increase.

## Biomarker Analysis: Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW)

RDW is a significant contributor to the prediction of biological age. Analysis includes 55 RDW tests conducted from 2015 to 2025, averaging around 5.5 tests per year.

**Optimal RDW Levels:**
The standard reference range for RDW is 11-15%. However, relying solely on this range can be misleading, as all 55 tests fell within this range, yet aging processes can still occur. Based on how RDW changes during aging and its association with all-cause mortality risk, a **lower RDW is generally considered optimal.**

**Trends and Correlations:**
A significant reduction in RDW has been observed over the past ten years. The correlation between RDW and chronological age is -0.67 (p<0.05), indicating a strong inverse relationship, which contrasts with the general age-related increase in RDW. The ongoing challenge is to maintain RDW within the lower end of the optimal range indefinitely, preventing any future age-related increases.

**Influence of Calorie Intake:**
Calorie intake shows a strong positive correlation with RDW, with a correlation coefficient of 0.74 (p<0.05). This suggests that calorie intake may be a significant factor in modulating RDW levels.

## Biomarker Analysis: Glucose

Analysis for glucose includes 57 tests conducted from 2015 to 2025.

**Reference and Optimal Ranges:**
*   **Quest Diagnostics Reference Range:** 65-99 mg/dL. All 57 tests fell within this range, making it not highly informative for optimization.
*   **Optimal Range (based on all-cause mortality risk data from a study of >10 million people):** 80-94 mg/dL.

**Glucose Trends:**
Out of 57 tests:
*   49 tests (86%) were within the optimal range of 80-94 mg/dL.
*   8 tests (14%) were above 94 mg/dL.

While the majority of readings are within the optimal range, the 14% of readings above the optimal threshold indicate room for improvement to minimize risk.

A weak, non-significant correlation (p=0.07, just outside statistical significance) for glucose levels against chronological age was observed, suggesting a small increasing trend in the data. This indicates that efforts are needed to prevent a substantial age-related increase.

**Recent Performance and Goals:**
The average glucose for the last two tests was 87.5 mg/dL. This is slightly higher than the best 14-test average over the ten-year period, which was 86 mg/dL. The goal is to consistently maintain glucose levels around 87-88 mg/dL or lower to further reduce the correlation with chronological age and flatten the rate of age-related change for this biomarker.
