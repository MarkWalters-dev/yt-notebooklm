# 2024-09-22 13y Younger Biological Age Blood Test 6 in 2024 Test 54 Since 2015

## Executive Summary

*   On 09/06/2024, a biological age of 38.6 years was calculated using the PhenoAge metric, which is 13 years younger than chronological age. This measurement is the 6th test in 2024 and the 54th since August 2015.
*   Annual average PhenoAge has been maintained in a youthful range, with the 2024 average (after 6 tests) at 34.6 years, translating to a 15-16 year younger biological age compared to chronological age.
*   Strong biomarker performance includes:
    *   **HDL:** Maintained in the optimal range (50-60 mg/dL for men) for 11 consecutive tests, with an average of 54.5 mg/dL.
    *   **HS-CRP:** Below the detection limit (<0.2 mg/L for the current test; previously <0.3 mg/L) for 19 consecutive tests.
    *   **Glucose:** Measured at 87 mg/dL, falling within the optimal range of 80-94 mg/dL associated with lowest all-cause mortality risk and typical of someone 20 years younger chronologically.
*   Areas for improvement identified:
    *   **Triglycerides:** At 75 mg/dL, this is above the desired target of less than 45 mg/dL, which is associated with the lowest coronary heart disease mortality risk.
    *   **Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV):** At 94.7 fL, this is the highest recorded value. An MCV of 94.7 fL is age-expected for someone aged 90 or older, and values above 95.8 fL are linked to increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Uric Acid:** While flagged low by the lab at 3.7 mg/dL, population data suggests optimal levels are around 5 mg/dL (found in youth and associated with lowest all-cause mortality risk). There is room to increase it slightly, potentially through diet, if desired for optimizing epigenetic age metrics.

## Biological Age Assessment (PhenoAge)

*   **Most Recent Test (09/06/2024):** 38.6 years (13 years younger than chronological age). This is the 6th test in 2024 and 54th since 2015.
*   **Historical PhenoAge Averages:**
    *   **2018-2019 (3 tests):** 36.1 years
    *   **2020 (6 tests):** 35.6 years
    *   **2021 (6 tests):** 35.6 years
    *   **2022 (7 tests):** 33.8 years (best average)
    *   **2023 (7 tests):** 34.7 years
    *   **2024 (first 6 tests):** 34.6 years

*   **Chronological Age Minus Biological Age (Trend):**
    *   **2018-2019:** 9-10 years younger
    *   **2020-2021:** 11-12 years younger
    *   **2022:** 15 years younger (average)
    *   **2023-2024 (so far):** Maintained in the 15-16 years younger range

*   **Observation & Future Plan:** The 09/06/2024 test result (13 years younger) is worse than the average for 2024 (15-16 years younger). Similar outliers were observed in late August/early September 2023. Further investigation into potential seasonal or environmental factors correlating with these outliers is planned to optimize future results. The goal for the remaining 2024 tests is to return to the 15-16 years younger range or better.

## Key Biomarkers

### HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein)

*   **Current Status:** Strength.
*   **Optimal Range (Men):** 50-60 mg/dL.
*   **Current Test Result:** Within the optimal range for the 11th consecutive test.
*   **Average HDL (past 11 tests):** 54.5 mg/dL.
*   **Average HDL (prior 43 tests):** ~45 mg/dL.
*   **Conclusion:** HDL levels can be increased and consistently maintained at higher levels.

### HS-CRP (High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein)

*   **Current Status:** Strength.
*   **Detection Limit:** Quest Diagnostics limit is now <0.2 mg/L (previously <0.3 mg/L).
*   **Current Test Result:** <0.2 mg/L.
*   **Trend:** Below the detection limit for the 19th consecutive test.

### Glucose (Fasting)

*   **Current Test Result:** 87 mg/dL.
*   **Optimal Range:** 80-94 mg/dL, associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk in a study of 12.5 million people.
*   **Age-Related Trends (Study of 12.5 million people):**
    *   **Youth (18-year-olds):** ~85 mg/dL (both men and women).
    *   **Older Adults (88-year-olds):** >100 mg/dL.
    *   **Age-Expected (51.6 years):** 99 mg/dL.
*   **Personal Trend (2024, first 6 tests):** Average glucose levels are 89.9 mg/dL (90 mg/dL), equivalent to the average for someone ~20 years younger chronologically. This is a contributing factor to the consistently younger PhenoAge.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk (Study of 12.5 million people):**
    *   Lowest risk observed when fasting glucose is 80-94 mg/dL.
    *   Significantly increased risk when glucose levels are <80 mg/dL or >94 mg/dL.

### Triglycerides

*   **Current Status:** Weak spot.
*   **Current Test Result:** 75 mg/dL.
*   **Optimal for CHD Mortality Risk (Study of 4.5 million people, 18-45 year olds):** Less than 45 mg/dL.
*   **Trend:** Coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality risk begins to increase when triglycerides are higher than ~45 mg/dL.
*   **Comparison to Reference Range:** Using the standard reference range cutoff (<150 mg/dL) results in a 30% higher CHD mortality risk compared to using a <45 mg/dL cutoff.
*   **Current Risk:** A triglyceride level of 75 mg/dL is associated with approximately a 15% increased CHD mortality risk compared to levels below 45 mg/dL.
*   **Goal:** Reduce triglycerides to less than 45 mg/dL.

### Uric Acid

*   **Current Test Result:** 3.7 mg/dL (flagged as low by the lab).
*   **Age-Related Trends:**
    *   **Men (20-year-olds):** Average 310 micromolar (5.2 mg/dL), with a slow, continuous increase with age.
    *   **Women (20-year-olds):** Lower average, stable/declining until ~40, then a steep, linear increase up to 80 years.
*   **Optimal for All-Cause Mortality Risk:** Around 5 mg/dL (or 300 micromolar), which is found in youth and associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk (J-shaped curve).
*   **Personal Context:** The 3.7 mg/dL level is close to the lowest risk but indicates room to increase. In a previous test, uric acid was 4.7 mg/dL, coinciding with improved epigenetic age metrics (Horvath epigenetic age and telomere length estimation).
*   **Future Plan:** May aim to slightly increase uric acid, potentially through higher protein intake and increased sardine consumption, to support epigenetic age metrics. The lab's "low" flag at 3.7 mg/dL is not a concern based on optimal youthful levels and all-cause mortality risk data.

### GGT (Gamma-glutamyl Transferase)

*   **New Test Added:** GGT is a liver-specific enzyme.
*   **Optimal Level:** Relatively lower is better.
*   **Future Consideration:** May be an important biomarker for other biological age tools, beyond PhenoAge.

### MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume)

*   **Current Status:** Weak spot.
*   **Current Test Result:** 94.7 fL (highest value over 51 tests since 2015).
*   **Definition:** Average volume of a Red Blood Cell; higher values indicate larger red blood cells.
*   **Age-Related Trends:**
    *   **Youth (26-year-olds):** Average ~90 fL (men).
    *   **Older Adults (90-year-olds):** Average ~94 fL.
    *   **Personal Context:** Current MCV of 94.7 fL is age-expected for someone aged 90 or older. This is considered unfavorable data.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk (Study of ~36,000 people):**
    *   Lowest risk associated with MCV less than 95.8 fL.
    *   MCV values greater than 95.8 fL are significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality risk (hazard ratio completely above 1 for the fourth quartile, >95.8 fL).
*   **Personal Goal:** Reduce MCV closer to 90 fL or lower. Future investigations will focus on correlations between diet composition and supplements with MCV to achieve this.
