# 2022-10-23 Breaths Per Minute While Asleep - What's Optimal

## Executive Summary
*   A sleeping respiratory rate greater than 16 breaths per minute (BPM) is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality in older adults.
*   The lowest all-cause mortality risk is observed in groups with a nighttime sleeping respiratory rate consistently below 16 BPM.
*   Age may confound mortality data, as groups with higher respiratory rates (>16 BPM) were statistically older in two studied cohorts.
*   Sleeping respiratory rate is calculated via **Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA)**, where heart rate increases upon inhalation and decreases upon exhalation.
*   Higher resting heart rates correlate directly with higher sleeping respiratory rates; a resting heart rate of 75 BPM correlates with a respiratory rate of 16 BPM.

## Mortality Association with Sleeping Respiratory Rate

Studies indicate a clear association between elevated nighttime sleeping respiratory rate and adverse health outcomes:

*   **Threshold:** A sleeping respiratory rate greater than 16 BPM is linked to increased all-cause mortality risk, measured up to 3,000 days post-assessment.
*   **Optimal Range:** The lowest all-cause mortality risk corresponds to a respiratory rate less than 16 BPM.

### Cohort 1 Data (406 Older Adults; Average Age 83.1)

| Respiratory Rate | All-Cause Mortality Risk | Average Age |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| > 16 BPM | Increased | 83.4 years |
| < 16 BPM | Lowest | 82.9 years |

*   **Observation:** The group with a higher respiratory rate (>16 BPM) was significantly older than the group with the lower mortality risk.

### Cohort 2 Data (2,700 People; Average Age 76.2)

| Respiratory Rate | All-Cause Mortality Risk | Average Age |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| > 16 BPM | Higher | 77 years |
| < 16 BPM | Reduced | 75.9 years |

*   **Observation:** Age may be a contributing factor, as the group with increased mortality risk (>16 BPM) was also significantly older (77 vs. 75.9 years).

## Calculating Sleeping Respiratory Rate

The sleeping respiratory rate is mathematically derived from heart rate (HR) data using the phenomenon known as Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA).

**Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA) Calculation:**
1.  Heart rate (HR) increases upon **Inhalation**.
2.  Heart rate (HR) decreases upon **Exhalation**.
3.  One complete cycle (Inhalation + Exhalation) equals one breath.
4.  Therefore, a higher average sleeping heart rate is associated with a higher nighttime sleeping respiratory rate.

### Heart Rate vs. Respiratory Rate Correlation (Fitbit Data, 10,000 Men/Women)

Data shows a direct, positive correlation between resting heart rate (RHR) and respiratory rate (RR):
*   As RHR increases from 45 BPM up to 85 BPM, the corresponding sleeping respiratory rate also increases.
*   **Mortality Link:** A respiratory rate of 16 BPM corresponds approximately to a Resting Heart Rate (RHR) of 75 BPM. Individuals with RHRs at or above this level may have respiratory rates associated with increased mortality risk.

## Fitness Trackers Providing Respiratory Rate Data

Several commercially available fitness trackers provide respiratory rate monitoring data:

*   Fitbit
*   Oura Ring
*   Whoop
*   Apple Watch

## Factors Affecting Nighttime Sleeping Respiratory Rate

Besides potential advanced age, several factors impact the respiratory rate, with the goal of optimization below 16 BPM:

### Body Mass Index (BMI)

Analysis of population data (10,000 individuals) using BMI vs. Respiratory Rate shows non-linear trends:

*   **Elevated BMI:** A BMI greater than 26 kg/m² is associated with a correspondingly increased respiratory rate.
*   **Lowest Rate:** The lowest respiratory rates in this population study were found around a BMI of 25 kg/m².
*   **Very Low BMI:** Respiratory rates appeared higher for individuals with BMIs below 20 kg/m² compared to those with a BMI of 25 kg/m².

### Personal Data vs. Population Data (Speaker's Data)

The speaker's personal data (567 days, March 2021–October 2022) showed a statistically significant but weak correlation ($r=0.17$, $p=0.02$) between respiratory rate and body weight:
*   **Speaker's Finding:** Higher respiratory rate was significantly correlated with higher body weight.
*   **Contrast with Population Data:** In the speaker's data, the respiratory rate increased as BMI rose from 23.6 up to 25.4, contrasting with the population data where the rate tended to decline toward a minimum at BMI 25.

### Immune Activation

Immune system activation directly impacts the respiratory rate:

*   The speaker recorded respiratory rates greater than 16 BPM only on days associated with vaccination (one day at exactly 16 BPM, two days after the second dose, and days following the third dose).
*   This suggests that immune responses, likely stemming from vaccination, acutely elevate the respiratory rate above the established mortality threshold.
*   **Implication:** This raises the question of whether older adults exhibiting chronic rates >16 BPM may suffer from underlying chronic immune activation (e.g., undiagnosed infection).
