# 2025-08-24 Cardiovascular Disease Risk Biomarker Analysis 70+ Tests Since 2005

**Executive Summary:**

*   Biological age, measured by the PhenoAge clock, is 16.5 years younger than chronological age. However, this clock notably lacks cardiovascular disease (CVD) specific biomarkers.
*   HDL and APO A1 levels are generally well-managed, with APO A1's 6-test average of 146 mg/dL being just below the optimal 150-180 mg/dL range.
*   Triglycerides, while averaging 61 mg/dL over 71 tests, have shown an undesirable upward trend in the last decade, with a goal of consistently reaching <45 mg/dL for optimal coronary heart disease (CHD) risk.
*   LDL levels (72-test average: 82.5 mg/dL) have historically fluctuated but are now intentionally stabilized, aiming to avoid age-related changes and maintain levels close to 65 mg/dL for lowest CHD progression.
*   Despite elevated Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) levels (average 90 nanomolar), chronically low high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels (46-test average: 0.37 mg/L, with no test >1 mg/L) may significantly mitigate overall CVD risk.
*   ApoB levels, with a 6-test average of 67 mg/dL, are within the optimal range of <70 mg/dL associated with the lowest CVD and all-cause mortality risk.

## Introduction

On July 22, 2025, a blood test revealed a biological age 16.5 years younger than chronological age, as calculated by the PhenoAge clock. While the PhenoAge clock incorporates biomarkers related to liver, kidney, metabolic, immune, and red blood cell health, it notably excludes cardiovascular disease (CVD) specific biomarkers. Given that CVD is a leading cause of death, a comprehensive analysis of these specific markers is crucial for a complete risk assessment.

## Cardiovascular Disease Risk Biomarkers

### HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein)

*   **Current Test Value:** 76 mg/dL.
*   **Reference Range:** >40 mg/dL.
*   **Optimal Range:** 50-69 mg/dL (based on meta-analyses of over 19 million people).
*   **Age Trend:** HDL naturally declines during aging.
*   **20-Year Data (73 tests):**
    *   Pre-2015: HDL levels showed a decline. Diet and fitness metrics were not rigorously tracked during this period.
    *   Post-2015: Following the initiation of consistent diet tracking (using FoodScale and Chronometer) and correlation analysis to optimize biomarkers, HDL levels increased in two distinct phases, with the second phase showing a steeper improvement.
    *   **Last 18 Tests:** Average HDL is 58 mg/dL, consistently within the optimal range.
*   **Goal:** Maintain HDL within the 50-69 mg/dL range and prevent any age-related decline in future tests.

### APO A1 (Apolipoprotein A1)

*   **Current Test Value:** 166 mg/dL.
*   **Reference Range:** >115 mg/dL (based on the 2004 Amoris study; updated 2021 Amoris data suggests a different range, but reference ranges are slow to adapt).
*   **Optimal Range:** 150-180 mg/dL (associated with lowest cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk, based on updated Amoris data and a 2024 epidemiological study).
*   **Data (6 tests):**
    *   Only recently started measuring APO A1, with six tests available.
    *   Current test (166 mg/dL) is within the optimal range.
    *   **6-Test Average:** 146 mg/dL, which is just below the lower bound of the optimal range.
*   **Goal:** Consistently achieve and maintain APO A1 levels within the 150-180 mg/dL optimal range.

### Triglycerides

*   **Current Test Value:** 62 mg/dL.
*   **Relationship to VLDL:** VLDL (lipoprotein) ≈ Triglycerides / 5.
*   **Reference Range:** <150 mg/dL.
*   **Optimal Range for All-Cause Mortality:** <90 mg/dL (meta-analysis).
*   **Optimal Range for Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Risk:** <45 mg/dL (study of 4.5 million people).
*   **Age Trend:** Triglycerides tend to increase during aging.
*   **20-Year Data (71 tests):**
    *   First 10 years: Triglycerides showed a reduction. This period lacked detailed diet/fitness tracking, but higher cardio activity may have been a contributing factor.
    *   Noteworthy: One increase occurred during a low-fat vegan diet (approx. 20% fat intake, compared to current ~40%), suggesting that in this case, lower fat intake was not beneficial for triglycerides.
    *   Last 10 years (excluding two outlier points): Triglyceride levels show an unfavorable upward trend.
    *   **71-Test Average:** 61 mg/dL.
*   **Goal:** Consistently reduce triglycerides to 45 mg/dL or less, and resist age-related increases. Future plans include incorporating more cardio to assess its impact.

### LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein)

*   **Current Test Value:** 86 mg/dL.
*   **Reference Range:** <100 mg/dL.
*   **Optimal Range for CHD Risk:** 65-120 mg/dL (study of 4.5 million people, adjusted for over 11 comorbidities).
    *   *Note:* Some data suggests higher LDL may be beneficial in very old individuals (over 80), possibly due to reverse causation (e.g., lower LDL in conditions like cancer cachexia).
*   **Age Trend:** LDL exhibits an inverse U-shape trend, being low in youth, peaking in midlife, and declining in advanced age.
*   **20-Year Data (72 tests):**
    *   The data displays two inverse U-trends (initial increase/decrease, followed by another increase/decrease).
    *   Pre-2015: The increase and decrease are not definitively attributed due to lack of detailed tracking.
    *   Post-2015: Fluctuations are related to varied dietary intake (fat 60-120 g/day; protein 70-150 g/day) and supplement adjustments made to evaluate biomarker correlations.
    *   Recently, LDL levels have become more stable due to intentional dietary consistency.
    *   **72-Test Average:** 82.5 mg/dL.
*   **Goal:** Maintain stable LDL levels, avoiding both age-related increases and decreases.

### Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]

*   **Current Test Value:** 91 nanomolar (flagged as high by the lab).
*   **Reference Range:** Exceeds >75 nanomolar.
*   **Optimal Range for CHD Risk:** <19 mg/dL or <48 nanomolar.
*   **Current test (91 nanomolar) is significantly higher than optimal.**
*   **Data (45 tests over 20 years):** Lp(a) is an add-on test, not part of a standard panel.
    *   First 10 years (pre-diet tracking): Average 106 nanomolar.
    *   One instance of a near-optimal Lp(a) level was achieved with very high-dose nicotinic acid (2000-3000 mg/day). However, this intervention also raised liver enzymes (AST/ALT close to 60), leading to its discontinuation due to liver health concerns.
    *   Excluding the nicotinic acid data point, the pre-2015 average was 112 nanomolar.
    *   Past 10 years (post-diet tracking): Average Lp(a) is 90 nanomolar, demonstrating a significant reduction (approximately 20%) compared to the first decade, achieved exclusively through diet.
*   **Current status:** Despite the reduction, 90 nanomolar remains substantially higher than the optimal <48 nanomolar.

### ApoB (Apolipoprotein B)

*   **ApoB-Containing Lipoproteins:** VLDL, LDL, IDL, and Lipoprotein(a) all contain the ApoB 100 protein.
*   **Current Test Value:** 71 mg/dL.
*   **Reference Range:** <90 mg/dL.
*   **Optimal Range for CVD & All-Cause Mortality Risk:** <70 mg/dL (based on combined data from two large studies).
*   **Current test (71 mg/dL) is just outside the optimal range.**
*   **Data (6 tests):** ApoB measurement was recently initiated and will be included in all future tests.
    *   **6-Test Average:** 67 mg/dL, which falls within the optimal range.
*   **Goal:** Maintain ApoB levels below 70 mg/dL indefinitely, preventing age-related increases or decreases.

## Inflammatory Markers

### hsCRP (High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein)

*   **Current Test Value:** <0.2 mg/L.
*   **Impact on Lp(a) Cardiovascular Risk:**
    *   A study examining cumulative incidence of CVD (heart attack, stroke, CHD diagnosis, angina, resuscitation, atherosclerotic/CVD-related death) in relation to Lp(a) and hsCRP levels showed:
        *   High Lp(a) (>50 mg/dL or >125 nanomolar) combined with high hsCRP (>=2 mg/L) was significantly associated with an increased risk of a CVD event over an 18-year period.
        *   Conversely, in individuals with relatively low hsCRP (<2 mg/L), CVD risk was approximately the same regardless of whether Lp(a) levels were low, medium, or high. This indicates that hsCRP significantly modifies the cardiovascular risk associated with Lp(a).
*   **Personal Data:**
    *   Current test: <0.2 mg/L.
    *   Last 26 consecutive tests: hsCRP has been below the detection limit of 0.3 mg/L.
    *   Last 10 tests: hsCRP has been below the lower detection limit of 0.2 mg/L.
    *   **46-Test Average (over 20 years):** 0.37 mg/L, with no test exceeding 1 mg/L.
*   **Implication:** Although Lp(a) is higher than the reference range, consistently low hsCRP levels over two decades may mitigate the associated coronary artery disease risk. It is noted that studies defining optimal Lp(a) ranges often do not adjust for hsCRP.

## Personal CVD Risk Factors and Family History

A strong family history of cardiovascular disease highlights the importance of rigorous biomarker tracking and intervention:

*   **Paternal Grandfather:** Died at 67 from CVD-related issues.
*   **Paternal Uncle:** Died at 51 from a stroke (experienced stroke at 48).
*   **Maternal Uncle:** Died at 67 from CVD-related issues and other comorbidities.

Avoiding death from cardiovascular disease is a top priority in personal health optimization.
