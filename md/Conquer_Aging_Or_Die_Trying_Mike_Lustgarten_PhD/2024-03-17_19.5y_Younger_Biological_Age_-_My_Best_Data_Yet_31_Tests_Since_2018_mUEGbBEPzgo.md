# 2024-03-17 19.5y Younger Biological Age - My Best Data Yet 31 Tests Since 2018

## Executive Summary

*   **Current Biological Age:** Calculated at 31.7 years using Dr. Morgan Levine's phenotypic age calculator, which is 19.5 years younger than chronological age. This represents the best result recorded across 31 tests since 2018.
*   **Historical Trend:** The average phenotypic age has shown a general downward trend: 36.1 (2018-2019) -> 35.6 (2020-2021) -> 33.8 (2022) -> 34.7 (2023) -> 33.0 (2024, year-to-date).
*   **Key Biomarker Improvements:** Significant improvements were noted in HDL (61 mg/dL, highest since 2015), Creatinine (0.91 mg/dL, below average), Liver Enzymes (ALT 23 U/L, AST 25 U/L, moving into low-risk range), and Red Blood Cell parameters (increased total RBC and hemoglobin, decreased Mean Corpuscular Volume - MCV).
*   **Other Relevant Biomarkers:** LDL is 82 mg/dL (purposely higher for potential Dunedin PACE benefits), HSCRP is < 0.3 mg/L, and Glucose is 84 mg/dL (lower than the historical average). Globulin was low at 1.8 g/dL but not deemed a concern.
*   **Future Outlook:** The primary goal is to sustain the 19.5-year biological age reduction in upcoming tests (next scheduled April 29, 2024) and over the long term. Future content will explore the dietary and supplement protocols associated with these results.

## Biological Age Calculation & Context

The speaker underwent a blood test for the second time in 2024, marking the 50th test since 2015. Using Dr. Morgan Levine's phenotypic age calculator, the biological age was determined to be 31.7 years, which is 19.5 years younger than the chronological age. The actual biological age might be even younger, as the HSCRP measurement was less than 0.3 mg/L (the detection limit for the 16th consecutive test).

To provide context, biological age results from 31 tests since 2018 are reviewed:

*   **2018-2019 (3 tests):** Average phenotypic age was 36.1 years. HSCRP was not consistently included in tests during this period.
*   **2020-2021 (12 tests, 6 per year):** Average phenotypic age was 35.6 years. HSCRP was included in every test.
*   **2022:** Average phenotypic age reduced to 33.8 years.
*   **2023:** Average phenotypic age increased to 34.7 years.
*   **2024 (2 tests so far):** Average phenotypic age is 33.0 years.

The latest test result of 31.7 years represents the best data to date across 31 tests. The goal is to maintain this 19.5-year reduction.

## Key Biomarker Analysis

*   **HDL:** Current HDL is 61 mg/dL, the highest recorded since 2015. The average HDL since 2015 over 50 tests is 46 mg/dL. This marks the seventh consecutive test where HDL was greater than or equal to 50 mg/dL.
*   **LDL:** Current LDL is 82 mg/dL. This value was a deliberate aim for the higher end of the recent range, theorizing that relatively higher LDL may correlate with a younger Dunedin PACE (epigenetic pace of aging). Dunedin PACE results are anticipated in late March or early April.
*   **HSCRP:** The measurement was less than 0.3 mg/L, which is the detection limit for Quest Labs.
*   **Glucose:** Current glucose is 84 mg/dL, which is lower than the average of 90 mg/dL recorded since 2015 over 48 tests. The aim is to consistently maintain lower glucose levels going forward.

## Other Biomarkers and Trends

*   **Creatinine:** Current creatinine is 0.91 mg/dL for the second consecutive test, lower than the 50-test average of 1.0 mg/dL. Reduced creatinine levels are potentially positive, as creatinine typically increases with age and can indicate reduced kidney function.
*   **Globulin:** The level is 1.8 g/dL, which is low and was flagged by QuestLab. While age-related changes are unclear, all-cause mortality data suggests values around 3 g/dL or higher are associated with an increased risk in older adults. A lower globulin (1.8 g/dL) is not considered a concern.
*   **Albumin/Globulin Ratio:** The ratio was flagged due to the combination of low globulin (1.8 g/dL) and a youthful albumin level of 5.1 g/dL.
*   **Liver Enzymes (ALT/AST):** Current ALT is 23 U/L and AST is 25 U/L, showing improvement from previous values of 24 U/L and 28 U/L respectively. Values in the low twenties are associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Red Blood Cell Parameters:**
    *   **Total Red Blood Cells:** 4.9 M/uL (up from 4.53 M/uL in the last test).
    *   **Hemoglobin:** 14.9 g/dL (up from 14.6 g/dL in the last test).
    *   **Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV):** 90.8 fL (down from 92.3 fL in the last test).
    These improvements are significant as both total red blood cells and hemoglobin typically decline with aging, while MCV (average red blood cell volume) typically increases with aging.

Other tests, including NAD, epigenetic and telomere testing, and metabolomics, were also conducted on March 4, with results pending for future updates.

## Future Outlook

*   **Consistency Goal:** The primary objective is to replicate the current biological age reduction (19.5 years younger) in the next test scheduled for April 29, 2024, to confirm it is not an isolated anomaly.
*   **Long-Term Maintenance:** The long-term goal is to maintain this reduction consistently over subsequent tests and years, preventing any age-related increase in biological age.
*   **Protocol Disclosure:** Future content will detail the specific diet and supplements that correspond to this 19.5-year younger biological age.
