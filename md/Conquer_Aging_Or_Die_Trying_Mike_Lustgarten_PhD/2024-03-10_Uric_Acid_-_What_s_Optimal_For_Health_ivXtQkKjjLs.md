# 2024-03-10 Uric Acid - What's Optimal For Health

## Executive Summary

*   Uric acid levels increase with age in both men and women, though the pattern is less pronounced in women until around age 38.
*   The lowest all-cause mortality risk is associated with uric acid levels around 300 micromolar (5 mg/dL) for men and 225 micromolar (3.8 mg/dL) for women.
*   Levels above 375 micromolar (6.3 mg/dL) are associated with a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality.
*   Levels below 175 micromolar (2.9 mg/dL) are also associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality.
*   Individual tracking data suggests that certain foods and nutrients, such as black pepper and ginger, are inversely correlated with uric acid levels, even after accounting for calorie intake.

## Uric Acid and Aging

*   Uric acid levels increase during aging for men.
*   For women, uric acid levels are relatively flat or show a small decline until approximately 38 years of age, after which they show a continuous increase.

## Uric Acid and All-Cause Mortality Risk

*   Lowest all-cause mortality risk is associated with uric acid levels of **300 micromolar (5 mg/dL)**.
*   For men, 300 micromolar is comparable to youthful levels.
*   For women, 300 micromolar is comparable to levels seen in older age (approximately 80 years old).
*   Youthful uric acid levels for women are around **225 micromolar (3.8 mg/dL)**, which is also close to the lowest risk range.
*   Levels **greater than approximately 375 micromolar (6.3 mg/dL)** are associated with a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   Levels **less than 175 micromolar (2.9 mg/dL)** are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.

## Optimal Uric Acid Targets

*   **For Men:** A good target is around **300 micromolar (5 mg/dL)**.
*   **For Women:** A good target is around **225 micromolar (3.8 mg/dL)**.
*   **For both men and women:** It is important to avoid the age-related increase and levels below 175 micromolar (2.9 mg/dL).

## Personal Data Analysis

### Uric Acid Levels Over Time

*   The individual's uric acid levels have remained relatively stable and have not followed the typical age-related increase over 48 blood tests from 2015 to 2024.
*   There is a significant inverse correlation between uric acid and age, with a correlation coefficient of -0.51.

### Methodology for Data Tracking

*   All food is weighed using a food scale.
*   Food amounts are entered into Chronometer.
*   Chronometer data is manually entered into a spreadsheet.
*   Each blood test is associated with the average dietary intake over the preceding period (e.g., 60 days between tests).
*   Correlations are calculated between diet (foods, macros, micros, supplements) and biomarkers.
*   Significant correlations are followed with the goal of improving biomarkers.

### Dietary Correlations with Lower Uric Acid

*   A partial list of foods and nutrients significantly inversely correlated with lower uric acid (higher intake associated with lower uric acid) includes:
    *   Black pepper
    *   Ginger
    *   Turmeric
    *   Brazil nuts
*   There are 21 significant inverse correlations for foods or nutrients.

### Dietary Correlations with Higher Uric Acid

*   A partial list of foods and nutrients significantly positively correlated with higher uric acid (higher intake associated with higher uric acid) includes:
    *   Total fructose
    *   Net carbs
    *   Vitamin E
    *   Cacao beans
    *   Vanilla beans
*   There are 23 significant positive correlations for foods or nutrients.

### Impact of Calorie Intake

*   Calorie intake is significantly positively correlated with higher uric acid.
*   Linear regression models adjusted for calorie intake were used to determine if individual food/nutrient correlations remained significant.

### Calorie-Adjusted Significant Correlations

**Negatively Associated with Uric Acid (even after calorie adjustment):**

*   Black pepper (P-value < 0.05)
*   Pistachios (just outside significance)
*   Strawberries (just outside significance)
*   Serrano peppers (just outside significance)
*   Mushrooms (P-value = 0.19)

**Positively Associated with Uric Acid (even after calorie adjustment):**

*   Total fructose
*   Net carbs
*   Vitamin E
*   Cacao beans
*   Vanilla beans
