# 2024-07-31 Which Biomarkers Are Most Predictive Of Biological Age

## Executive Summary

*   Higher levels of **glucose**, **HbA1c**, and **adiponectin** are consistently associated with an older biological age across data from both LabCorp and Quest.
*   Higher **albumin** levels are consistently associated with a younger biological age in both men and women, observed across both LabCorp and Quest data.
*   Higher **absolute lymphocyte count** and **lymphocyte percentage** are associated with a younger biological age (demonstrated in LabCorp data).
*   Elevated **blood lead levels** are associated with an older biological age (demonstrated in Quest data), showing a comparable predictive strength to glucose and HbA1c.
*   **Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW)** is associated with an older biological age, though not identified as the most significant predictor in this analysis.

## Biomarker Associations with Biological Age (LabCorp Data)

Data from LabCorp analyzed the association between various biomarkers and biological age, relative to chronological age, for each standard deviation increase in a biomarker. An older biological age indicates a greater age than chronological age, while a younger biological age indicates a lesser age.

*   **Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW):** Associated with an older biological age, but not the strongest predictor.
*   **Glucose & HbA1c:** Relatively higher levels of glucose and HbA1c are associated with an older biological age.
*   **Adiponectin:** Relatively higher levels of adiponectin are associated with an older biological age. Adiponectin is produced by fat cells.
*   **Albumin:** Relatively higher albumin levels are significantly associated with a younger biological age in both men and women.
*   **Total Protein:** Total protein levels show a similar association to albumin, consistent with albumin being a major component of total protein (total protein = albumin + globulin).
*   **Lymphocytes:** Relatively higher absolute levels of lymphocytes and a higher lymphocyte percentage are significantly associated with a younger biological age.

## Cross-Lab Validation (Quest Data)

An external validation was performed using clinical lab data from Quest, applying the same methodology to assess biomarker associations with biological age. This provided an opportunity to confirm findings from the LabCorp data.

*   **Glucose & HbA1c:** Relatively higher levels of glucose and HbA1c are again associated with an older biological age, replicating the LabCorp findings across two different lab testing companies.
*   **Adiponectin:** Relatively higher levels of adiponectin are once again associated with an older biological age, consistent with LabCorp data.
*   **Blood Lead Levels:** Blood lead levels are associated with an older biological age. This association is comparable in significance to the effects of relatively high levels of glucose and HbA1c.
*   **Albumin:** Relatively higher levels of albumin are once again associated with a younger biological age in both men and women, consistently observed across both Quest and LabCorp data.

## Summary of Key Findings

When examining data from two distinct lab testing companies (LabCorp and Quest), several biomarkers consistently emerge as predictive of biological age:

*   **Associated with an Older Biological Age:** Glucose, HbA1c, and adiponectin.
*   **Associated with a Younger Biological Age:** Albumin.

Additionally, specific associations were noted within individual datasets:

*   Higher absolute lymphocyte count and lymphocyte percentage were linked to a younger biological age in the LabCorp data.
*   Higher blood lead levels were linked to an older biological age in the Quest data.
