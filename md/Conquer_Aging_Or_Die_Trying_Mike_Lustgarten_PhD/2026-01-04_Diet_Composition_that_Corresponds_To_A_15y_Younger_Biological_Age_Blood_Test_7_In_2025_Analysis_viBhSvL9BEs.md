# 2026-01-04 Diet Composition that Corresponds To A 15y Younger Biological Age Blood Test 7 In 2025 Analysis

## Executive Summary
*   Biological age, measured by PhenoAge, was 15 years younger than chronological age for blood test number 7 (October 27, 2025).
*   Dietary intake analyzed was the 41-day average between test 6 (Sept 16) and test 7 (Oct 27, 2025).
*   Initial experiment to increase whole-food Omega-3 intake (via sardines, flaxseed, walnuts) to correlate with DHEA sulfate levels failed, resulting in the lowest recorded DHEA sulfate level.
*   Correlation analysis following test 7 indicated added salt intake had the strongest positive correlation with DHEA sulfate, while olives and nutmeg showed inverse correlations.
*   Experimentation with Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) involved reducing Brazil nut intake based on a strong positive correlation; however, this resulted in the highest ever MCV recorded (96 fL), suggesting the correlation was not causative.

## Study Methodology & Data Period
The analysis focuses on the average daily dietary intake over a 41-day period corresponding to Blood Test 7:
*   **Period:** September 16, 2025 (day after Test 6) through October 26, 2025 (day before Test 7).
*   **Data Tracking:** Food was weighed daily using a food scale since 2015 (>99% accuracy). Data logged into Chronometer and exported to a spreadsheet for averaging.
*   **Foods Consumed:** 54 different foods were consumed during this period (measured in grams, except Green Tea in ounces and Cookies in total calories).

## Focused Experimental Interventions (Test 7 Cycle)

Three specific dietary experiments were conducted between Test 6 and Test 7:

### 1. Omega-3 Intake vs. DHEA Sulfate
*   **Background:** DHEA sulfate is crucial for age-related phenotypes (osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes, cancer), is immunomodulatory, and neuromodulatory. Optimal plasma levels are suggested to align with the median found in youth ($\approx 300 \text{ mcg/dL}$).
*   **Prior Correlation:** A significant positive correlation ($r=0.41, p=0.05$) was found between average daily whole-food Omega-3 intake and DHEA sulfate levels.
*   **Intervention:** Primary omega-3 sources (Sardines, Flaxseed, Walnuts) were increased to test correlation vs. causation.
    *   Sardines: Increased from $92 \text{ g/day}$ to $\approx 143 \text{ g/day}$.
    *   Flaxseed: Increased from $21 \text{ g/day}$ to $23 \text{ g/day}$.
    *   Walnuts: Increased from $3 \text{ g/day}$ to $\approx 8 \text{ g/day}$.
*   **Result:** The intervention failed. DHEA sulfate experienced a precipitous decline, resulting in the lowest level recorded across 25 tests (from a previous stable average of $126 \text{ mcg/dL}$).

### 2. Brazil Nuts vs. Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)
*   **Background:** MCV (average red blood cell volume) increases with age; lower MCV is associated with youth. MCV was moving in the wrong direction prior to this test.
*   **Prior Correlation (Post Test 6):** Brazil nut intake showed a strong positive correlation with higher MCV ($r=0.72, p < 0.05$).
*   **Intervention:** Brazil nut intake was reduced from $12 \text{ g/day}$ to $\approx 5 \text{ g/day}$.
*   **Result:** The intervention failed to lower MCV. MCV reached its highest recorded level ($\approx 96 \text{ fL}$) across 60 tests. Following this result, the correlation weakened ($r$ moved from $0.72$ to $0.64$).

### 3. Fat Intake vs. Lipoprotein A (Lp(a))
*   **Intervention:** Total fat intake was increased to test significant correlations found for total fat and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) associated with lower Lp(a).
*   **Specific MUFA Test:** Avocado intake, which had an inverse correlation with Lp(a) post-Test 6, was more than doubled, increasing from $41 \text{ g/day}$ to $\approx 87 \text{ g/day}$.
*   **Result:** The experiment failed. Lp(a) remained essentially unchanged (Test 6: $81 \text{ nM}$ vs. Test 7: $80 \text{ nM}$).

### Cheat Meal Protocol
*   A 3-day post-test celebration protocol was used:
    *   Day 1: Peanut butter and jelly/Nutella.
    *   Day 2: Peanut butter and Nutella.
    *   Day 3: Homemade ice cream (ground cookies, powdered sugar, heavy cream).
*   **Calorie Impact:** Total "junk" calories over 3 days were approximately $1,550$, accounting for $1.6\%$ of the total calories consumed during the 41-day period ($98.4\%$ clean diet).

## Diet Composition (41-Day Average)

### Top Calorie Contributors (Top 10)
Sardines were the top calorie source. Eight of the ten top calorie contributors from Test 6 remained in the top 10 for Test 7. Avocados, almonds, pistachios, and Brazil nuts dropped out of the top 10.

### Macronutrient Profile
| Metric | Average Value | % of Total Calories | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Calories** | $2,302 \text{ kcal/day}$ | N/A | Aiming for weight stability. |
| **Protein** | $126 \text{ g/day}$ | $22\%$ | |
| **Fat (Total)** | $101 \text{ g/day}$ | $39\%$ | Increased from $84 \text{ g/day}$ in the prior period. |
| **Carbohydrates (Total)** | $267 \text{ g/day}$ | N/A | |
| **Fiber** | $82 \text{ g/day}$ | N/A | |
| **Net Carbs** | $185 \text{ g/day}$ | $\approx 32\%$ | |
| **SCFA Calories** | $\approx 150 \text{ kcal}$ | $\approx 6.5\%$ | From soluble fiber fermentation. |
| **Net Macros** | Fat: $46\%$ / Net Carbs: $32\%$ / Protein: $22\%$ | N/A | This profile was *not* associated with the best biological age recorded in 2025. |

*   **Saturated Fat (Sat Fat):** Kept relatively low, supporting consistent low readings for Statin C and B2M.
*   **Fructose:** Total fructose intake averaged $50 \text{ g/day}$, a decrease from the previous period ($57 \text{ g/day}$). Higher fructose intake correlated with more biomarkers moving in the wrong direction.

## Micronutrient Findings & Adjustments for Test 8

### Vitamins and Minerals
*   The general goal was to achieve Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) coverage for all vitamins and minerals.
*   **Carotenoids:** Maintained high levels due to consistent correlation with younger biological age.
*   **Sodium:** Intake averaged $2,700 \text{ mg/day}$. This followed an increase from $1,700 \text{ mg/day}$, which negatively impacted blood pressure.
    *   **Adjustment for Test 8:** Sodium intake was cut by $\approx 500 \text{ mg/day}$ to re-evaluate effects on HRV, resting heart rate, and blood pressure.

### Correlation Analysis for Test 8 Planning (Focus: DHEA Sulfate)
Following Test 7, new correlations were calculated across 25 tests:
*   **Strongest Positive Correlation:** Added salt intake ($r=0.78$).
*   **Other Positive Correlations:** Dates, vanilla bean, beets, and coconut butter.
*   **Inverse Correlations (To be reduced/eliminated):** Olives, nutmeg, avocado, celery, corn, kimchi, and lemon.

**Test 8 Adjustments based on DHEA Sulfate Correlations:**
*   Added salt intake was reinstated.
*   Olive intake was cut by half.
*   Nutmeg and avocado were removed.
*   Celery intake was cut by one-third.

**Test 8 Adjustments based on MCV Correlations:**
*   **Inverse Correlation:** Cacao ($r$ inversely correlated with MCV) was added back at $10 \text{ g/day}$.
*   **Positive Correlation:** Lycopene (from tomatoes) was reduced from $\approx 200 \text{ g/day}$ to $\approx 125 \text{ g/day}$. (The rationale for reducing lycopene is complex, as cacao intake is limited by saturated fat concerns related to Statin C and B2M).

**Test 8 Adjustments based on Lp(a) Correlations:**
*   Chickpea intake was doubled (from $\approx 40 \text{ g/day}$ to $\approx 80 \text{ g/day}$) due to a significant inverse correlation with Lp(a).

**Test 8 Adjustments based on Fructose:**
*   Strawberry intake was increased following the observation that lowering fructose slightly accompanied the 15-year biological age reduction, but this progress stalled in subsequent tests.
