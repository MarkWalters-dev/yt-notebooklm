## Executive Summary
* **Engineered Rewilding:** Integrating microbial building materials and "living walls" into indoor spaces can stimulate improved immune activation through constant exposure to beneficial bacteria.
* **Social Vectors of Health:** Multi-generational living and high-frequency social interaction act as natural delivery systems for microbial diversity, breaking the "bubble" of suburban isolation.
* **Sibling-Mediated Protection:** Infants with older siblings show higher proportions of *Lactobacillus* in their lungs, skin, and gut, likely due to siblings acting as vectors for environmental microbes.
* **Ventilation Dynamics:** Increased airflow is most beneficial when the external environment contains a healthy, diverse microbiome.

## Engineering the Microbial Built Environment
To counteract the sterile nature of modern indoor spaces, new architectural strategies are being developed to reintroduce beneficial microbial exposure:

* **Microbial Building Materials:** Incorporating specific bacterial strains directly into the structural components of buildings.
* **Living Walls:** Utilizing systems of plants and microbes to improve the air quality and immune-stimulating potential of indoor workspaces.
* **Enhanced Ventilation:** Increasing the exchange of indoor and outdoor air to facilitate the movement of beneficial microbes from the natural environment into the home.

**Path to Immune Activation:**
Microbial Building Materials/Living Walls -> Release of beneficial microbes into the air -> Inhalation and skin contact by occupants -> Stimulation of the human immune system

## Social Vectors for Microbial Diversity
Modern suburban living often limits microbial exchange. Transitioning to more interactive and multi-generational living structures can significantly alter an individual's microbiome.

**The Sibling Effect on Infant Health:**
Older siblings serve as a bridge between the outside world and the household environment:

1. Older siblings interact with diverse external environments (school, outdoors, peers).
2. Siblings transport environmental microbes (such as *Lactobacillus*) back into the home.
3. Infants in the home are exposed to these microbes through daily interaction.
4. **Result:** Infants with older siblings exhibit higher levels of beneficial *Lactobacillus* in the gut, lungs, and on the skin.

**Microbial Transfer Process:**
External Environment -> Older Sibling Interaction -> Physical contact/Shared environment -> Microbial transfer to Infant -> Increased *Lactobacillus* colonization
