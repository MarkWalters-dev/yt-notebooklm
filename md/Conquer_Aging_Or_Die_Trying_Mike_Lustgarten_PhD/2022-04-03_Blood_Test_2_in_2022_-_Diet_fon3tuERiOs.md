# 2022-04-03 Blood Test 2 in 2022 - Diet

## Executive Summary

*   Biological age for Test 2 was 35.4 years (13.7 years younger than chronological age) using PhenoAge, and 28 years (21 years younger than chronological age) using aging.ai.
*   Both Test 1 and Test 2 in 2022 showed greater reductions in biological age compared to the pre-2022 average over 15 and 27 blood tests, respectively.
*   The diet for Test 2 closely replicated the diet for Test 1 in terms of calorie intake, macronutrient composition (fat, protein, fiber, sugars, net carbs), and most micronutrients.
*   The primary dietary differences between Test 1 and Test 2 were increased strawberry intake and decreased blackberry/blueberry intake in Test 2, along with a shift from peanuts to almonds.
*   The consistent dietary approach between Test 1 and Test 2 is a potential contributing factor to the improved biological age results observed in these tests.

## Biological Age Results (2022)

### Test 1 (Prior to Test 2)

*   **PhenoAge:**
    *   Biological Age: 32.6 years
    *   Difference from Chronological Age: 16.4 years younger
    *   *Comparison to Pre-2022 Average (15 tests):* 4 years further reduction from the average 12-year reduction.
*   **Aging.ai:**
    *   Biological Age: 26 years
    *   Difference from Chronological Age: 23 years younger
    *   *Comparison to Pre-2022 Average (27 tests):* Approximately 7 years further reduction from the average 16.4-year reduction.

### Test 2

*   **PhenoAge:**
    *   Biological Age: 35.4 years
    *   Difference from Chronological Age: 13.7 years younger
    *   *Comparison to Pre-2022 Average (15 tests):* Approximately 2 years younger than the average 12-year reduction.
*   **Aging.ai:**
    *   Biological Age: 28 years
    *   Difference from Chronological Age: 21 years younger
    *   *Comparison to Pre-2022 Average (27 tests):* Approximately 5 years further reduction from the average 16-year reduction.

**Overall Observation:** Both Test 1 and Test 2 in 2022 yielded better biological age results than the average improvements observed in previous blood tests since 2015.

## Dietary Comparison: Test 1 vs. Test 2 (2022)

The goal for Test 2 was to replicate the diet from Test 1 to assess its impact on biological age.

### Calorie Intake

*   **Test 1:** Average 2322 calories/day (42-day period)
*   **Test 2:** Average 2343 calories/day (49-day period)
*   **Statistical Analysis (Two-sample t-test):** Not significantly different (p > 0.05, p = 0.08).
*   **Conclusion:** Calorie intake was similar between the two test periods.

### Macronutrients

The aim was to replicate the macronutrient composition from Test 1 for Test 2.

*   **Total Fat:**
    *   Test 1: ~84 grams/day
    *   Test 2: ~83 grams/day
    *   **Statistical Analysis:** Not significantly different.
*   **Individual Fats:**
    *   Monounsaturated Fats: Not different (~16 grams/day)
    *   Polyunsaturated Fats: Not different (~23 grams/day)
        *   Omega-3: Not different (8 grams vs. 8.1 grams)
        *   Omega-6: Not different (15.4 grams vs. 15.5 grams)
    *   Saturated Fat: Identical (24.4 grams/day)
*   **Protein:**
    *   Test 1: 102 grams/day
    *   Test 2: 103 grams/day
    *   **Statistical Analysis:** Not different.
*   **Fiber:**
    *   Test 1: ~86 grams/day
    *   Test 2: ~86 grams/day
    *   **Statistical Analysis:** Not different.
*   **Total Fructose (Fructose + Sucrose/2):**
    *   Test 1: 65 grams/day
    *   Test 2: 62 grams/day
    *   **Statistical Analysis:** Not different.
*   **Net Carbohydrates:**
    *   Test 1: ~243 grams/day
    *   Test 2: ~248 grams/day
    *   **Statistical Analysis:** Not different.

**Conclusion:** Similar levels of total fat, individual fats, protein, fiber, total fructose, and net carbohydrates were maintained between Test 1 and Test 2.

### Micronutrients

*   **Vitamins:**
    *   **General Trend:** Most vitamins were not significantly different between the two periods.
    *   **Exception:** Vitamin C intake was approximately 100 mg higher in Test 2.
    *   **Vitamin B12:** Intake was significantly higher than RDA (~300-318 mcg/day) due to supplementation with methyl B12 (1000 mcg every three days). This supplementation was planned to be discontinued for the next test.
    *   **Vitamin D:** Intake was higher in Test 1 (~1280 IU/day) due to winter supplementation (1000 IU/day), which was removed as summer approached.
*   **Minerals:**
    *   **General Trend:** Almost all minerals showed no significant difference in average daily amounts.
    *   **Exception:** Potassium intake was approximately 300 mg/day higher in Test 2, likely due to increased strawberry consumption.

**Conclusion:** Micronutrient intake was largely consistent, with minor increases in Vitamin C and Potassium, and planned changes in B12 and Vitamin D supplementation.

### Food Intake Differences

The following foods showed statistically significant differences between Test 2 and Test 1:

*   **Increased Intake:**
    *   **Strawberries:** ~260 grams/day more in Test 2. This was due to Costco running out of the usual three-berry mix (strawberries, blackberries, blueberries) and substituting with strawberries.
    *   **Watermelon:** 3 grams/day higher in Test 2 (statistically significant, but insignificant in amount).
    *   **Pickles:** 4 grams/day higher in Test 2 (statistically significant, but insignificant in amount).
    *   **Almonds:** 7 grams/day higher in Test 2. This increase was partly to meet the target of 20 mg/day of Vitamin E.
*   **Decreased Intake:**
    *   **Brazil Nuts:** 0.1 grams/day less in Test 2 (statistically significant, but insignificant in amount).
    *   **Peanuts:** Reduced from ~6 grams/day to ~0.7 grams/day in Test 2. This shift from peanuts to almonds was to increase Vitamin E intake.
    *   **Blackberries & Blueberries:** Zero intake in Test 2, a direct consequence of the berry mix substitution at Costco.
*   **"Junk Food" Consumption:**
    *   **Test 1:** Nutella mixed with peanut butter (homemade Reese's), and pizza (consumed due to travel).
    *   **Test 2:** A different version of homemade Reese's (milk chocolate bar mixed with M&Ms) and peanut butter. Pizza was not consumed. The amounts for the milk chocolate and M&Ms were approximately 100 grams each over the two days of the test and the day after.
    *   **Strategy:** Junk food was consumed only on the day of the blood test and the day after, then eliminated for the remainder of the period. This approach appears to be effective.

**Conclusion:** The overall diet for Test 2 was very similar to Test 1, with the primary deviations being increased strawberries, decreased blackberries/blueberries, a shift from peanuts to almonds, and a slightly different type of "junk food" consumed strategically on the test day.

## Future Strategy

To maintain biological age improvements, the aim is to stick as closely as possible to the diet composition demonstrated in Test 1 and Test 2. Achieving a greater than 14-year biological age reduction (using VINES test as an example) would be an improvement over the previous 12-year average. This consistent dietary approach is considered a contributing factor to the observed improvements.
