# 2023-01-08 Attempting To Optimize The Oral Microbiome Part 3 - A Role For Berberine

## Executive Summary

*   The addition of clove oil (Test 3) resulted in the complete elimination of *Tannerella forsythia*, but *Fusobacterium nucleatum* levels paradoxically increased from 0.7% (Test 2) to 2.2%.
*   Adding potassium nitrate to the mouthwash (Test 2 and 3) did not increase nitrate-reducing bacteria; the highest levels were observed without any added nitrate (Test 1).
*   In vitro data suggests Berberine Chloride effectively reduces levels of key periodontal pathogens, specifically *Porphyromonas gingivalis* and *Fusobacterium* species, while simultaneously promoting the growth of *Streptococcus* species.
*   Based on preliminary data, clove oil and potassium nitrate were removed from the mouthwash protocol. Berberine Chloride (100 $\mu$g/mL) was added, and supplementation with *Streptococcus salivarius* was initiated.

## Background: Target Pathogens and Alzheimer's Link

The initial goal of the study was to reduce salivary levels of:
*   *Tannerella forsythia*
*   *Fusobacterium nucleatum*

Both of these bacteria, along with *P. gingivalis*, have been linked to Alzheimer's disease progression.

## Methodology and Testing Rounds

The speaker used a homemade mouthwash three to five times daily as a prebiotic (a substance that stimulates the growth of existing beneficial bacteria). Quantification of the salivary microbiome was performed using **Bristle**.

| Test Number | Mouthwash Modification |
| :---: | :--- |
| Test 1 | Baseline (Homemade Mouthwash only) |
| Test 2 | Test 1 + 4 g/L Potassium Nitrate |
| Test 3 | Test 1 + Clove Oil + Summer Savory Oil |

## Impact on Target Pathogens (*T. forsythia* and *F. nucleatum*)

| Bacterium | Test 1 | Test 2 | Test 3 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| *Tannerella forsythia* | Detected | Detected | 0% |
| *Fusobacterium nucleatum* | 1.0% | 0.7% | 2.2% |

Test 3 showed mixed results: *T. forsythia* was eliminated, but *F. nucleatum* increased significantly.

## Impact of Potassium Nitrate on Nitrate-Reducing Bacteria

Nitrate has been shown *in vitro* to act as a prebiotic, potentially increasing nitrate-consuming bacteria while reducing pathogenic species. The primary genera responsible for nitrate reduction in the speaker's samples were *Neisseria* and *Rothia*.

| Test Number | Potassium Nitrate Concentration | % Nitrate-Reducing Bacteria |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Test 1 | 0 g/L | $\approx 53\%$ |
| Test 2 | 4 g/L | $46\%$ |
| Test 3 | 2 g/L | $35.5\%$ |

Conclusion: Nitrate-reducing bacteria levels decreased as nitrate concentration increased. The highest levels were observed in Test 1 (no added KNO3). Therefore, potassium nitrate was removed from future protocols. The speaker hypothesized that high nitrate levels from diet may have already saturated the oral nitrate-reducing bacteria.

## Impact of Clove Oil on Other Salivary Bacteria

### 1. Oral Health Related (Beneficial) Bacteria

"Beneficial bacteria" (mostly non-nitrate reducers, plus *Neisseria mucosa*) comprised:
*   Test 1 & 2: $\approx 21\%$ of total microbes.
*   Test 3: $19.8\%$ of total microbes.

Conclusion: Clove oil did not increase the proportion of these beneficial bacteria.

### 2. Pathogenic Bacteria Assessment

#### Tooth Decay Related Bacteria
Levels remained relatively low across all three tests ($\le 0.3\%$).

#### Halitosis (Bad Breath) Related Bacteria
Levels increased from the 5–6% range (Tests 1 & 2) to **9.4%** in Test 3.

#### Gum Inflammation Related Bacteria
Levels trended upward: 3.8% (Test 1) -> 1.8% (Test 2) -> **4.9%** (Test 3).

**Key Contributors to Halitosis/Inflammation (Test 3):**
The majority of the increase was attributed to:
*   *Fusobacterium* species (*F. nucleatum* and *F. periodontica*): Contributing 5.8% of the 9.4% total.
*   *Porphyromonas* species (*P. endodontalis* and *P. gingivalis*): Contributing 2.7% of the total.

Goal for Test 4: Reduce levels of bacteria belonging to the *Fusobacterium* and *Porphyromonas* genera.

## In Vitro Evidence for Berberine

The following data comes from an *in vitro* study spiking saliva from 20 healthy individuals (controls) with *P. gingivalis*.

### Spiking Saliva with *P. gingivalis* (Control Effect)

When *P. gingivalis* was added to the saliva samples:
*   *Porphyromonas* (green) levels significantly increased.
*   *Fusobacterium* (yellow) levels significantly expanded.
*   *Streptococcus* (blue) levels were reduced by approximately half (from $\approx 20\%$ to $\approx 10\%$ in the spike).

### Berberine Chloride (BC) Effect on Spiked Saliva

Berberine Chloride was tested at 15, 30, and 60 $\mu$g/mL.

1.  ***Porphyromonas* Reduction:** At the highest dose (60 $\mu$g/mL), *Porphyromonas* levels returned to the original, unspiked baseline, despite the sample being spiked with *P. gingivalis*.
2.  ***Fusobacterium* Reduction:** At the highest dose (60 $\mu$g/mL), *Fusobacterium* levels were almost completely eliminated.
3.  ***Streptococcus* Expansion:** At the highest dose, *Streptococcus* levels expanded significantly, reaching over $30\%$ (compared to $\approx 20\%$ in the original untreated saliva).

### Berberine Effect on Specific Species

The *in vitro* study confirmed that Berberine impacted the specific species of concern:
*   **Target Pathogens (*P. gingivalis*, *F. nucleatum*, *F. periodonticum*):** At the highest dose (60 $\mu$g/mL), the sum of these three species was 1.7%, matching the baseline level found in saliva not spiked with *P. gingivalis*.
*   ***Streptococcus* Species:** Berberine significantly promoted the growth of four relevant *Streptococcus* species, with the highest dose raising their cumulative relative abundance from 17.5% (untreated baseline) to **31.8%**.

The speaker noted that their own *Streptococcus salivarius* levels showed room for improvement (Test 1: 0%; Test 2: 0.2%).

## Test 4 Protocol Changes

Based on the *in vitro* data showing positive effects on key pathogens and beneficial *Streptococcus* genera, the following modifications were implemented for Test 4 (in use for one week):

1.  **Add Berberine Chloride:** Dosed slightly higher than the study, at **100 $\mu$g/mL** (100 mg/L).
2.  **Remove Potassium Nitrate:** As it showed no beneficial effect.
3.  **Remove Clove Oil:** As it did not improve the overall salivary microbiome composition.
4.  **Initiate *Streptococcus salivarius* Supplementation:** Used as an oral prebiotic for two days to "seed" the beneficial bacteria, allowing Berberine to positively influence their growth thereafter.
