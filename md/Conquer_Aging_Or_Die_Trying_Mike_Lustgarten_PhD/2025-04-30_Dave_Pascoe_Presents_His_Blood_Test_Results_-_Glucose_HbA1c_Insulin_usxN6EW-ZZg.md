# 2025-04-30 Dave Pascoe Presents His Blood Test Results - Glucose HbA1c Insulin

**Executive Summary:**
*   Dave Pascoe's average glucose level is approximately 90 mg/dL, which he deems higher than ideal.
*   Despite strict sugar avoidance, his HbA1c (a three-month average of blood glucose) shows a concerning upward trend, indicating a need to identify underlying causes beyond sugar intake.
*   Insulin levels exhibit variability but an overall flat trend, presenting challenges for definitive interpretation due to age-related changes in pancreatic beta cell function.
*   Given the rising HbA1c, Acarbose, a medication that limits glucose absorption, is being considered for consistent use rather than only for anticipated high-sugar intake.
*   The speaker notes the complexity of proving causation in personal blood marker analysis, focusing instead on identifying correlations and optimizing health strategies.

## Glucose

Dave's average glucose level is around 90 mg/dL. This reading is noted as higher than desired.

## HbA1c

HbA1c, which represents a three-month average of hemoglobin glycation, is considered a more valuable indicator than individual glucose readings due to its long-term perspective. Dave's HbA1c trend is increasing, which is a significant concern. This upward trend is occurring despite rigorous sugar avoidance, suggesting that sugar intake is not the primary cause and prompting further investigation into other contributing factors.

## Insulin

Insulin levels show considerable variability but an overall flat trend. Interpreting insulin levels is complex because pancreatic beta cells, which secrete insulin, typically show decreased function at older ages. Insulin levels often peak around ten years post-youth and then decline, following an inverse U-shaped curve. Therefore, relatively low insulin levels could be indicative of a youthful state or, in some cases, pancreatic beta cell failure. However, the presence of values as high as 5 suggests that beta-cell failure is unlikely in this specific case.

## Intervention Considerations

Dave has a prescription for Acarbose, a medication designed to blunt sugar spikes by limiting glucose absorption. Initially, Acarbose was intended for occasional use (e.g., before consuming a birthday cake). However, due to the concerning upward trend in HbA1c, daily or more consistent use of Acarbose is now being considered. While Acarbose limits some glucose absorption, it does not block all of it.

## Interpretation Challenges

Establishing direct causation for changes in blood markers is challenging. Instead, observed correlations guide strategy. For instance, if a specific food (e.g., collard greens) were hypothetically linked to a marker like HDL, completely removing it for experimental verification would be undesirable. The approach is to identify a "recipe" that yields optimal data and observe correlations to inform health decisions.
