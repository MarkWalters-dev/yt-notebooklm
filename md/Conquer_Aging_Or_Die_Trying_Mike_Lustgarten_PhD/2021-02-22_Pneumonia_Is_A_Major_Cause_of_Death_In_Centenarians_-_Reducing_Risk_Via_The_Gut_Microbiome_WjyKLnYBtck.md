# 2021-02-22 Pneumonia Is A Major Cause of Death In Centenarians - Reducing Risk Via The Gut Microbiome

## Executive Summary
*   Pneumonia is a leading cause of death in centenarians, accounting for approximately 18% of all deaths in this age group, surpassing heart disease (8.6%) and cancer (4%).
*   The incidence of pneumonia-related deaths significantly increases with age, rising from 6% in 80-year-olds to 18% in individuals over 100.
*   A high soluble fiber diet in mice infected with influenza A virus or *Klebsiella pneumoniae* significantly improved survival rates compared to control diets.
*   Supplementation with butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid produced from soluble fiber fermentation, also doubled survival rates in mice infected with influenza A virus and protected against bacterial lung infection.
*   Human studies suggest that higher dietary fiber intake is associated with a reduced risk of death from respiratory diseases, including pneumonia, although direct randomized controlled trials in older adults are still needed.

## Pneumonia as a Leading Cause of Death in Centenarians

*   In individuals over 100 years old (n=36,000), the primary cause of death was classified as "old age" (28%).
*   Cause-specific mortality for centenarians:
    *   Heart disease: 8.6%
    *   Cancer: 4%
    *   Pneumonia: ~18%
*   Pneumonia-related deaths increase with age:
    *   80-year-olds: ~6% of deaths
    *   80-85 year-olds: ~8.3% of deaths
    *   85-90 year-olds: ~11.5% of deaths
    *   90-95 year-olds: ~14% of deaths
    *   95-100 year-olds: ~14.6% of deaths
    *   Centenarians (100+ years old): ~18% of deaths
*   Conversely, deaths from heart disease and cancer decrease with age in this cohort:
    *   Heart disease: Decreases from 19% in 80-year-olds to ~9% in centenarians.
    *   Cancer: Decreases from 24.5% in 80-year-olds to 4.4% in centenarians.

### Pneumonia Overview
*   Pneumonia is an infection of the lung(s) causing inflammation, difficulty breathing, and subsequent complications.
*   ICD-10 codes J12 through J18, encompassing viral and bacterial pneumonia, were used for designation in the study.

## Gut Microbiome and Lung Infection Survival in Mice

### Soluble Fiber Diet and Viral Lung Infection
*   **Study Design:** Young female mice infected with influenza A virus.
*   **Diets:**
    *   Control diet: 30% cellulose (poorly fermentable fiber).
    *   High soluble fiber diet: 30% inulin (soluble fiber fermented by gut bacteria).
*   **Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs):** Fermentation of soluble fiber produces SCFAs: acetate (2 carbons), propionate (3 carbons), and butyrate (4 carbons).
*   **Results:**
    *   Control diet: 50% survival at ~9 days.
    *   High soluble fiber diet: 50% survival at ~14 days.
    *   This indicates improved defense against viral lung infection with a high soluble fiber diet.

### SCFAs and Viral Lung Infection Survival
*   **SCFA Levels:**
    *   Fecal samples: Acetate doubled, butyrate increased ~150-fold in soluble fiber-fed mice.
    *   Plasma samples: Acetate doubled, propionate increased, butyrate increased ~150-fold in soluble fiber-fed mice.
*   **Butyrate Supplementation:**
    *   Mice given water: 50% survival at ~8 days post-influenza A infection.
    *   Mice given butyrate in water: 50% survival at ~17 days post-influenza A infection.
*   **Conclusion:** High soluble fiber diets increase SCFA production by gut bacteria, which can improve survival after viral lung infection.

### SCFAs and Bacterial Lung Infection Survival
*   **Study Design:** Mice infected with *Klebsiella pneumoniae*.
*   **Treatment Groups:**
    *   Vehicle-treated mice (no SCFA).
    *   Butyrate-treated mice.
*   **Results:**
    *   Vehicle-treated mice: 50% survival at ~80 hours post-bacterial infection.
    *   Butyrate-treated mice: All mice survived past 80 hours post-bacterial infection.
*   **Conclusion:** SCFAs, particularly butyrate, play a protective role in the lungs' defense against bacterial infection.

## Human Evidence: Fiber Intake and Respiratory Disease Mortality

*   **Study Scope:** Data on death from respiratory diseases, including ICD codes J10-J18 (viral and bacterial pneumonia) and J40-J47 (other respiratory diseases like COPD).
*   **Men:**
    *   Highest fiber intake (29g/day) associated with a 31% reduced risk of death from respiratory diseases compared to lowest intake (12.6g/day).
    *   Fiber intake above ~19g/day (quintile 4) showed a 26% reduced risk.
*   **Women:**
    *   Quintile 2 (slightly higher than lowest intake of 10.8g/day) showed a 19% reduced risk.
    *   Further reductions observed in higher quintiles:
        *   Quintile 3: 27% reduction
        *   Quintile 4: 42% reduction
        *   Quintile 5 (highest, ~25g/day): 46% reduction compared to ~11g/day.

## Conclusion and Future Directions

*   A high fiber diet, particularly soluble fiber, may be a strategy to reduce the risk of death from respiratory diseases, including pneumonia.
*   However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) directly testing this hypothesis in older adults with pneumonia are still needed to confirm these findings.
