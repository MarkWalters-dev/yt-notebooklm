# 2020-08-27 Fungi In The Blood Fungi In The Brain - Rapamycin To The Rescue

## Executive Summary
*   Candida bloodstream infections show a significant age-related increase, rising 11 to 12-fold in individuals over 85 years compared to those aged 18-44.
*   *Candida albicans* and *Candida glabrata* fungi have been detected in various brain regions (e.g., frontal cortex, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, but were absent in control subjects.
*   Rapamycin demonstrates potent antifungal activity *in vitro*, completely eliminating the growth of *Candida albicans* and reducing *Candida glabrata* growth by 4-6 fold.
*   *In vivo*, rapamycin significantly improves survival in mice with *Candida albicans* bloodstream infections, achieving 100% survival at a 20 mg/kg dose.
*   While there are no completed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) specifically testing rapamycin to prevent or slow AD progression based on its antifungal properties, one early-phase RCT for AD patients started recruiting in June 2020.

## Candida Infections Increase with Age

An increased incidence of microbes in the blood, including *Candida* fungi, is observed during aging. *Candida* bloodstream infections show an 11 to 12-fold increase with age.

Data on *Candida* bloodstream infections per 100,000 population by age group:
*   **18-44 years:** 1.4-2.3 cases
*   **45-64 years:** 4.5-6.8 cases (a 3-fold increase relative to the youngest group)
*   **65-84 years:** 12.5-18.6 cases (an 8-9 fold increase relative to the youngest group)
*   **Older than 85 years:** 17.3-25 cases (an 11-12 fold increase relative to the youngest group)

## Fungi Found in Alzheimer's Disease Brains

The presence of microbes in the blood may lead to their presence in the brain. *Candida albicans* has been found in various brain regions of Alzheimer's disease patients, including the external frontal cortex, cerebellar hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex. Immunostaining shows DAPI (blue) for nuclei, human neurofilament (red), and *Candida albicans* (green). Green or yellow (co-localization of red and green) staining indicates the presence of fungi.

Analysis of entorhinal cortex sections from 10 different Alzheimer's disease patients confirmed the presence of *Candida albicans* in each patient.

It is not limited to *Candida albicans*; other *Candida* species, such as *Candida glabrata*, have also been detected in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. Staining for *Candida glabrata* (green) showed its presence in each Alzheimer's disease patient analyzed.

In contrast, brain sections from 10 control subjects showed no evidence of *Candida* species (no green or yellow staining). This suggests a link between the age-related increase of *Candida* in the blood and its presence in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients.

## Rapamycin as an Antifungal

Rapamycin is a known antifungal agent.
*   ***In vitro* activity against *Candida albicans***:
    *   In dishes without rapamycin, wild-type *Candida albicans* shows robust growth.
    *   The addition of rapamycin completely eliminates *Candida albicans* growth.
*   ***In vivo* activity against *Candida albicans* in mice:**
    *   **Protocol:**
        *   Mice were intravenously injected with *Candida albicans*.
        *   Rapamycin was administered at increasing doses.
    *   **Results:**
        *   Mice receiving no rapamycin (dose zero) had zero survival.
        *   Increasing doses of rapamycin led to increased survival.
        *   At a 20 mg/kg dose of rapamycin, 100% survival was observed in mice intravenously injected with *Candida albicans*.
    *   **Conclusion:** Rapamycin protects against *Candida* in the blood, likely by eradicating the injected *Candida*.
*   ***In vitro* activity against *Candida glabrata***:
    *   In the absence of rapamycin, *Candida glabrata* exhibited full growth.
    *   As rapamycin concentration increased (e.g., from 5 to 10 micrograms per mL), *Candida glabrata* growth was significantly reduced, showing a 4 to 6-fold reduction.

These data indicate that rapamycin is a potent antifungal against both *Candida albicans* and *Candida glabrata*.

## Rapamycin in Alzheimer's Disease Trials

Despite the evidence for fungi in Alzheimer's disease brains and rapamycin's antifungal properties, there are currently no completed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) specifically using rapamycin to prevent or slow Alzheimer's disease progression based on this mechanism. However, one early-phase RCT investigating rapamycin treatment in Alzheimer's disease patients began recruiting in June 2020.
