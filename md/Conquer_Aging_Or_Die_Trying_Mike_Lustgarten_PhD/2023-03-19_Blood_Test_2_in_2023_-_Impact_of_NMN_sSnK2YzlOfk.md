# 2023-03-19 Blood Test 2 in 2023 - Impact of NMN

## Executive Summary
*   Recent blood tests indicate a biological age of 32.8 years using Levine's pheno age calculator, which is 17.3 years younger than chronological age.
*   Another biological age metric, Aging.AI, predicts an age of 27 years, 23.1 years younger than chronological age.
*   NMN supplementation at an average of 340 mg/day, with a period of 1000 mg/day prior to the test, showed no significant impact on either biological age metric.
*   Homocysteine levels are elevated at 11.1 mg/dL, indicating a direction of aging, prompting a new supplementation protocol.
*   DHEA sulfate levels remain stable at 129 µg/dL, with no apparent impact from NMN supplementation.

## Biological Age Metrics

### Levine's Phenotypic Age (Pheno Age)

*   **Current Test (03/06/2023):** 32.8 years
    *   This is 17.3 years younger than chronological age.
    *   Quest's high sensitivity C-reactive protein measurement was consistently below 0.3 mg/L for the ninth consecutive test.
*   **Historical Data:**
    *   2018-2019 (3 tests): Average Pheno Age of 36.1 years
    *   2020-2021 (12 tests): Average Pheno Age of 35.6 years
    *   2022 (7 tests): Average Pheno Age of 33.8 years
    *   2023 (First test): 33.0 years
    *   2023 (Second test): 32.8 years
*   **NMN Impact:** Supplementation with NMN for the 42-day period preceding the second 2023 test, at an average of 340 mg/day (including 1000 mg/day for the final week), did not result in a significant change in Pheno Age. Values as low as 32.8 have been recorded four times since 2021.

### Aging.AI Age

*   **Current Test:** 27 years
    *   This is 23.1 years younger than chronological age.
    *   Aging.AI incorporates 19 biomarkers.
*   **Historical Data:**
    *   2009-2013 (3 tests): Average Aging.AI Age of 32 years
    *   2016-2022 (34 tests): Average Aging.AI Age of 29.9 years
    *   2023 (First test): 28 years
    *   2023 (Second test): 27 years
*   **NMN Impact:** The slight decrease from 28 to 27 years in 2023 is considered close enough to suggest no major effect of NMN on Aging.AI age. Values as low as 27 or 26 have been recorded four times since 2016.

## NMN Supplementation Analysis

NMN supplementation was undertaken for a significant portion of the period between the two 2023 blood tests.
*   **Average Daily Intake:** 340 mg/day.
*   **Intensified Intake:** 1000 mg/day for the seven days immediately preceding the most recent blood test.
*   **Observed Effect:** No statistically significant impact on either Levine's Pheno Age or Aging.AI age was observed. This suggests that NMN may not be necessary for further improvement of these specific biological age markers.

## Other Biomarkers and Interventions

### Homocysteine

*   **Current Level:** 11.1 mg/dL.
*   **Interpretation:** This level is considered elevated and indicates a direction of aging.
*   **Intervention Initiated (03/11/2023):**
    *   Serine: 2 grams per day
    *   Vitamin B6: 5 mg per day (more than double previous intake)
*   **Hypothesis:** This supplementation aims to reduce homocysteine and potentially increase DHEA sulfate.

### DHEA Sulfate

*   **Current Level:** 129 µg/dL.
*   **Interpretation:** This level has not shown a significant increase despite NMN supplementation and the hypothesis that increased NAD+ could impact DHEA sulfate.

## Future Investigations

*   **Epigenetic Age Analysis:** Blood was sent for epigenetic analysis on the same day as the blood tests. Results are expected in late March or early April, with a video to follow.
*   **Other Contributing Factors:** A future video will explore factors beyond NMN, including diet and other supplements, that may contribute to biological age reduction.
*   **Serine + B6 Impact:** A follow-up video will assess the effectiveness of serine and vitamin B6 supplementation on homocysteine and potentially DHEA sulfate levels.
