# 2024-04-14 Attempting To Slow The Epigenetic Pace Of Aging 13-Test Analysis

## Executive Summary

*   The Dunedin PACE epigenetic clock demonstrates comparable efficacy to other leading epigenetic clocks (Horvath, Hannem, PhenoAge, GrimAge) in its association with all-cause mortality risk.
*   Dunedin PACE is uniquely sensitive among the tested clocks, identifying a significantly slower epigenetic pace of aging in humans on a 12% calorie-restricted diet over two years, while other clocks showed no significant difference.
*   Analysis of 13 personal epigenetic tests revealed no significant dietary correlations with Dunedin PACE for the speaker.
*   An inverse correlation (correlation coefficient -0.57, p=0.05) was found between the speaker's LDL cholesterol (within a range of 62-83 mg/dL) and Dunedin PACE, suggesting higher LDL is associated with a slower epigenetic pace of aging in this personal data.
*   An ongoing personal experiment is investigating if deliberately increasing LDL cholesterol (via saturated fats from coconut butter and dietary cholesterol from eggs) can consistently reduce the epigenetic pace of aging as measured by Dunedin PACE.

## Epigenetic Clock Efficacy

Six gold standard epigenetic clocks were evaluated for their association with all-cause mortality risk, measured by hazard ratio (HR), in two studies: the Normative Aging Study and Framingham Offspring. The clocks assessed were Dunedin PACE, an earlier iteration of Dunedin PACE (Dunedin PACE of Aging Methylation, POAM), Horvath, Hannem, PhenoAge (epigenetic test), and GrimAge. A significant association was observed when the confidence interval for the hazard ratio was entirely above one, indicating an increased risk of all-cause mortality.

*   **Dunedin PACE, earlier Dunedin PACE, PhenoAge, and GrimAge:** All were significantly associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk in both studies. A faster epigenetic pace of aging (for Dunedin PACE) or an older epigenetic age (for PhenoAge and GrimAge) correlated with a higher risk of death.
*   **Horvath and Hannem:** In the Normative Aging Study, neither Horvath nor Hannem showed a significant association with all-cause mortality risk. In Framingham Offspring, Horvath was not associated with all-cause mortality risk, but Hannem did show a significant association.
*   **Conclusion:** Dunedin PACE is as effective as the best epigenetic clocks for its association with all-cause mortality risk. Horvath, while excellent for predicting chronological age, is not among the best for its association with all-cause mortality risk.

## Dunedin PACE Sensitivity to Calorie Restriction

A two-year human study compared epigenetic age changes from baseline in an ad libitum (eating as desired) group versus a calorie-restricted (12% fewer calories) group, using Horvath, Hannem, PhenoAge, GrimAge, and Dunedin PACE clocks. Epigenetic age was assessed at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months.

*   **Horvath, Hannem, PhenoAge, and GrimAge:** No significant difference in epigenetic age was observed between the ad libitum and calorie-restricted groups for Horvath and Hannem at either time point. Similarly, for PhenoAge and GrimAge, three of the four time points were not significantly different between groups. While the PhenoAge data for the calorie-restricted group showed a trend towards an older epigenetic age, this difference was not statistically significant compared to the ad libitum group.
*   **Dunedin PACE:** People on the ad libitum diet exhibited an increased epigenetic pace of aging over the two-year study, whereas individuals on the 12% calorie-restricted diet had a significantly reduced epigenetic pace of aging.
*   **Conclusion:** Dunedin PACE is the only epigenetic clock among those tested that identified a significantly slower epigenetic pace of aging in people adhering to a 12% calorie-restricted diet for two years.

## Personal Dunedin PACE Data

The speaker's Dunedin PACE score from a March 24, 2024 test was 0.82. The range for this test indicates 0.6 as the slowest epigenetic aging rate and 1.4 as the fastest. Personal data indicates a Dunedin PACE slower than the average trend for the speaker's chronological age, as Dunedin PACE values generally increase with chronological age. The long-term goal is to achieve and maintain the slowest possible epigenetic pace of aging, ideally around 0.6.

**Historical Dunedin PACE Averages:**

*   **2022 (3 tests):** Average Dunedin PACE = 0.84
*   **2023 (8 tests):** Average Dunedin PACE = 0.80
*   **2024 (first 2 tests):** Average Dunedin PACE = 0.81

The speaker's most recent three-test average within the past six months is 0.785, which would place them in a tie for eleventh place on the Rejuvenation Olympics leaderboard (based on a calculation of 3+ tests in the past 6 months). When considering the five tests over the past six months, the average is 0.8787, which would rank 12th.

## Dunedin PACE Optimization Strategy

The speaker employs an iterative process to optimize biomarkers, including Dunedin PACE, by analyzing dietary and other biomarker correlations.

### Dietary Correlation Methodology

1.  **Daily Food Tracking:** Since 2015, all food is weighed and recorded in the Cronometer app.
2.  **Data Export & Spreadsheet:** Daily dietary data is manually entered into a personal spreadsheet.
3.  **Blood Test Synchronization:** Each blood test result is matched with the average dietary intake for the period between the previous and current blood test (e.g., 50 days of average intake linked to the latter test).
4.  **Correlation Calculation:** Correlations are calculated between dietary factors (macro, micronutrients, individual foods) and various biomarkers using accumulated blood test data (up to 50 tests for some biomarkers, 13 for Dunedin PACE).
5.  **Intervention & Re-evaluation:** Significant correlations (p < 0.05) are used to guide dietary changes aimed at improving biomarkers. After each subsequent test, correlations are recalculated, and the strategy is refined in a continuous iterative process.

### Dietary Correlations for Dunedin PACE (13 Tests)

An analysis of 91 dietary comparisons (foods, macro- and micronutrients) with Dunedin PACE revealed no statistically significant correlations (p < 0.05). This means diet alone has not provided clear leads for optimizing Dunedin PACE in the speaker's personal data.

### Biomarker Correlations and LDL Hypothesis (12 Tests)

To gain further insight, the speaker also analyzes correlations between other biomarkers (from full chemistry panels, CBC, metabolomics) and Dunedin PACE.

#### LDL-Dunedin PACE Correlation

*   An inverse correlation was observed between LDL cholesterol and Dunedin PACE (correlation coefficient -0.57, p=0.05).
*   This suggests that within the speaker's LDL range of 62 to 83 mg/dL, higher LDL is correlated with a slower epigenetic pace of aging, and conversely, lower LDL is correlated with a faster pace of aging.
*   This correlation is hypothesized to be a potential target for intervention.

#### Experiment 1: Increasing Saturated Fat Intake

*   **Goal:** Increase LDL by increasing saturated fatty acid intake, specifically from coconut butter (identified as a strong correlate for higher LDL in the speaker's data).
*   **Intervention:** Coconut butter intake was significantly increased to 26 grams per day for three weeks prior to the March 2024 test, compared to 16 grams per day prior to the January test (p < 0.05).
*   **Result:** LDL was 82 mg/dL for the March test, placing it at the high end of the speaker's observed range (62-83 mg/dL) but not exceeding it. The goal was to push LDL even higher (e.g., 85-90 mg/dL) to fully evaluate the correlation.
*   **Re-evaluation:** The LDL-Dunedin PACE correlation, using 12 tests, remained significant with a negative correlation coefficient of -0.57 and a p-value of 0.05.

#### Experiment 2: Modifying Diet for Next Test

*   **Goal:** Further increase LDL to 85-90 mg/dL or higher to more definitively test the correlation with Dunedin PACE.
*   **Intervention:** For the upcoming test, the speaker plans to increase not only saturated fatty acid intake (coconut butter) but also add dietary cholesterol (5 eggs per week), as cholesterol intake is another strong correlate for higher LDL in their personal data.
*   **Anticipated Outcome:** If LDL increases as targeted, the speaker will evaluate if Dunedin PACE consistently falls into the low 0.7 range (e.g., 0.73).
*   **Next Test Date:** April 29, 2024.
