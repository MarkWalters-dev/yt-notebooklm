# 2021-08-29 Which Gut Bacteria Are Associated With Poor Health And How Can We Limit Them

## Executive Summary

*   Higher levels of gut *Enterobacteriaceae* are strongly associated with increased all-cause mortality risk, including deaths from gastrointestinal issues, cancer, and respiratory problems.
*   *Enterobacteriaceae* levels increase significantly with aging (1.7-fold higher in older adults compared to younger individuals).
*   Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs), produced by gut bacteria from soluble dietary fiber, inversely correlate with *Enterobacteriaceae* levels; higher SCFAs are associated with lower *Enterobacteriaceae*.
*   Aging is characterized by significantly lower SCFA levels (e.g., ~50% reduction in total SCFAs from those under 50 to those over 80 years old).
*   Strategies to increase SCFAs, such as consuming a high soluble fiber diet and engaging in regular endurance exercise, are promising for reducing *Enterobacteriaceae*, though more randomized controlled trials are needed, especially in older adults.

## The Gut Microbiome's Impact on Health

The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in host health, affecting numerous organ systems.

**Positive Effects:**
*   Basic digestion and nutrient absorption.
*   Vitamin production.
*   Degradation of foreign metabolites (xenobiotic degradation).
*   Immune system maturation and function.
*   Gut-muscle axis modulation.
*   Brain development and behavior.
*   Protection and clearance from pathogen invasion.

**Negative Effects:**
*   Intestinal issues: colon cancer development, gastrointestinal disorders.
*   Extra-intestinal effects: metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity, chronic kidney disease.

Given these impacts, identifying harmful gut bacteria and strategies to limit them is key for optimizing health and longevity.

## Enterobacteriaceae: A Marker of Increased Mortality Risk

Higher gut microbiome levels of *Enterobacteriaceae* (often referred to as enterobacteria for short) are associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.

**Associated Mortality Risks:**
*   **All-cause mortality:** Significantly increased risk with higher *Enterobacteriaceae* levels.
*   **Gastrointestinal-related deaths:** Increased risk.
*   **Cancer-related deaths:** Increased risk (total cancer, not specified if gastrointestinal only).
*   **Respiratory-related deaths:** Increased risk, suggesting a gut-lung axis linkage, particularly for pneumonia and viral infections.

**Outcomes Not Associated:**
*   Cardiovascular deaths.
*   Neurological deaths.

**Aging and Enterobacteriaceae:**
*   *Enterobacteriaceae* levels increase during aging.
*   A study found *Enterobacteriaceae* levels were 1.7-fold higher in older adults (average age 75 years) compared to younger subjects (average age 35 years).

## Limiting Enterobacteriaceae with Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)

*Enterobacteriaceae* levels are limited in the presence of Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs).

### SCFA Production Pathway

Dietary fiber is composed of insoluble fiber (mostly not fermented) and soluble fiber.

**Soluble Dietary Fiber -> Gut Microbiota -> Acetate, Propionate, Butyrate (SCFAs)**

### Mouse Data: SCFAs Limit Enterobacteriaceae Growth

A study using young mice demonstrated the inverse relationship between SCFAs and *Enterobacteriaceae* levels.

**Study Methodology:**
1.  **Mice:** Young mice (2 months old) were treated with antibiotics to deplete their existing gut microbiome.
2.  **Colonization:** Mice were then colonized with one of three bacterial species:
    *   *Klebsiella pneumoniae* (an *Enterobacteriaceae* species)
    *   *E. coli* (an *Enterobacteriaceae* species)
    *   *Proteus mirabilis* (previously classified as *Enterobacteriaceae*, now in the closely related *Morganellaceae* family).
3.  **Measurements:** Colony Forming Units (CFU) per gram were measured for bacterial load, and SCFA levels were measured in the cecum.
    *   *Note on Cecum:* The cecum, at the junction of the small and large intestines, contains the highest amounts of SCFAs in the large intestine. SCFA levels decrease as they progress through the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon to the rectum due to rapid metabolism.
4.  **Interventions:** After initial colonization, mice were divided into groups:
    *   **Control (Initial Colonization):** Showed very high levels of *Enterobacteriaceae* (around 10^10 CFU/gram).
    *   **Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) Gavage:** Mice were force-fed PBS. This resulted in a reduction of *Enterobacteriaceae* and almost doubled SCFA levels. PBS may have partially washed away bacteria and allowed SCFA-producing bacteria to grow.
    *   **Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT):** Mice were force-fed feces from normal mice (not treated with antibiotics). This intervention dramatically reduced *Enterobacteriaceae* levels to near the limit of detection, and SCFA levels significantly increased (ranging from 30 to 70 millimolar).

**Key Findings:**
*   A strong inverse correlation (-0.81) was observed between *Enterobacteriaceae* levels and SCFA levels.
*   Higher SCFA levels were consistently associated with lower levels of *Enterobacteriaceae*.

**Conclusion:** *Enterobacteriaceae* levels are limited in the presence of short chain fatty acids.

### Human Data: SCFAs Decrease with Aging

Human data confirms that SCFA levels significantly decrease during aging.

**SCFA Reduction Across Age Groups (mM):**
| SCFA Type   | < 50 years | 50-65 years | 66-80 years | > 80 years | Reduction (<50 vs. >80) |
| :---------- | :--------- | :---------- | :---------- | :--------- | :---------------------- |
| Acetate     | 49         | 38          | 26          | 19         | > 50%                   |
| Propionate  | 16         | 13          | 11          | 8          | 50%                     |
| Butyrate    | 12         | 11          | 9           | 7          | Approaching 50%         |
| **Total**   | **~77**    | **~62**     | **~46**     | **~34**    | **> 50%**               |

**Conclusion:** Aging is characterized by lower levels of SCFAs and higher levels of *Enterobacteriaceae*.

## Interventions to Increase SCFA Levels

To reduce *Enterobacteriaceae* and all-cause mortality risk, the focus should be on increasing SCFA levels.

### 1. High Soluble Fiber Diet

*   A high soluble fiber diet is expected to maximize gut bacteria's SCFA production, which in turn should limit *Enterobacteriaceae* levels.
*   **Current Research Gap:** There are currently no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in older adults (over 60 years) that have specifically tested the hypothesis that a high soluble fiber diet increases SCFAs and reduces *Enterobacteriaceae*.

### 2. Exercise Training

Exercise training has also been shown to increase SCFA levels.

**Study on Sedentary Adults:**
*   **Participants:** 32 previously sedentary individuals, aged 20-45 years.
*   **Protocol:** Six-week study involving endurance exercise three times a week.
*   **Results:**
    *   **Lean Subjects (BMI < 25):** Showed significant increases in acetate, propionate, and butyrate after training.
    *   **Obese Subjects (BMI > 30):** Did not experience an impact on SCFA levels from exercise training.

**Supporting Evidence from Athletes:**
*   Professional athletes, such as rugby players, consistently exhibit higher levels of fecal SCFAs (acetate, propionate, butyrate) compared to non-athletes.

**Current Research Gap:** Similar to dietary fiber interventions, there are no known RCTs that have measured the effect of exercise training on SCFAs and *Enterobacteriaceae* levels specifically in older adults (over 60 years).
