# 2023-03-21 NAD Test 3 - Impact of 1000 mg NMN d

## Executive Summary

*   Initial intracellular NAD $^{+}$ levels were measured at 25.6 micromolar ($\mu$M), placing the baseline in the 'aged' category according to Jinfiniti reference data.
*   Supplementation with 300 mg of NMN per day for 21 days resulted in no significant change in intracellular NAD $^{+}$ levels (25.3 $\mu$M).
*   Increasing the NMN dosage to 1000 mg (1 gram) per day for one week successfully elevated the intracellular NAD $^{+}$ level to 39.3 $\mu$M.
*   The resulting 39.3 $\mu$M NAD $^{+}$ concentration places the level close to the 'youthful' range (defined as >40 $\mu$M, typically found in individuals under 30 years old).
*   Despite the significant increase in NAD $^{+}$ levels, there was no immediate corresponding change observed in blood biomarker-based biological age calculations (Levine’s test and aging.ai) or DHEA sulfate levels.

## Study Methodology

Intracellular NAD $^{+}$ levels were quantified using blood analysis sent to Jinfiniti Precision Medicine. The study involved three distinct testing periods:

### Baseline Test

*   **Date:** January 23, 2023
*   **Finding:** NAD $^{+}$ level was 25.6 $\mu$M (Aged category).

### Intervention 1: Low-Dose NMN

*   **Protocol:**
    *   **Compound:** NMN
    *   **Dosage:** 300 mg per day
    *   **Duration:** 21 days
*   **Retest Date:** February 21, 2023

### Intervention 2: High-Dose NMN

*   **Protocol:**
    *   **Compound:** NMN
    *   **Dosage:** 1000 mg (1 gram) per day
    *   **Duration:** 1 week
*   **Retest Date:** March 5, 2023

## NAD Quantification Results

| Test Number | Date | NMN Daily Dose | Intracellular NAD $^{+}$ Level ($\mu$M) | Change from Baseline | Category |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | Jan 23, 2023 | 0 mg | 25.6 | Baseline | Aged |
| 2 | Feb 21, 2023 | 300 mg | 25.3 | -0.3 $\mu$M | Aged |
| 3 | Mar 5, 2023 | 1000 mg | 39.3 | +13.7 $\mu$M | Near Youthful |

The goal of achieving a youthful level is defined as an NAD $^{+}$ concentration greater than 40 $\mu$M. The 1000 mg daily dose successfully raised the level significantly, approaching this youthful target.

## Ancillary Biomarkers

During the final retest on March 5, 2023, a full blood panel was conducted to assess the systemic impact of the increased NAD $^{+}$ levels:

### Biological Age Biomarkers

Despite the substantial increase in NAD $^{+}$ concentration, there was no observable change in metrics derived from standard blood panel biomarkers, including:

*   Levine’s biological age test
*   aging.ai assessment

### Hormonal Status

*   **DHEA sulfate:** No impact was recorded. The DHEA sulfate level was 129 micrograms per deciliter ($\mu$g/dL), which falls within the typical historical range for the subject.

### Epigenetic Age

*   Blood was simultaneously sent for epigenetic analysis (True Diagnostic) on the same day as Test 3. Data regarding the impact of elevated NAD $^{+}$ on epigenetic age is currently pending.
