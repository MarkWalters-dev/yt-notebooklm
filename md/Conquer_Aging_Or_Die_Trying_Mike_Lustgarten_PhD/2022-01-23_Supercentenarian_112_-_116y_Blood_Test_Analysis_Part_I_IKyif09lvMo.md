# 2022-01-23 Supercentenarian 112 - 116y Blood Test Analysis Part I

## Executive Summary
*   Jirohimon Kimura, who lived to 116 years old, displayed remarkably youthful fasting glucose and Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, placing him in a similar risk profile for all-cause mortality as individuals in their twenties to thirties.
*   His white blood cell count fell within the range associated with the longest life expectancy, and his initial C-reactive protein (CRP) measurement at age 112 was exceptionally low, suggesting minimal inflammation at that time.
*   Triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels were also within ranges associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk and were comparable to or better than those observed in centenarian studies.
*   However, his kidney function, assessed by Cystatin C and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), indicated age-related decline and unhealthy levels, placing him at higher risk for all-cause mortality based on these markers.
*   Albumin and red blood cell counts were indicative of his advanced age, not suggesting youthful or optimal health.

## Blood Biomarker Analysis

### Fasting Blood Glucose
*   **Jirohimon's Data (mg/dL):**
    *   Age 111: 80
    *   Age 113.3: 111
    *   Age 115.7: 87
*   **Context:** Fasting blood glucose generally increases with age.
*   **Average:** Jirohimon's average fasting glucose over this period was 92.7 mg/dL, comparable to individuals in their thirties.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** A U-shaped curve exists, with levels < 80 mg/dL and > 94 mg/dL associated with increased risk. Jirohimon's average was near the lowest risk portion of the curve.
*   **Conclusion:** Jirohimon's glucose data was relatively youthful and indicated healthy levels associated with low all-cause mortality risk.

### Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
*   **Jirohimon's Data (%):**
    *   111 years old: 5.0
    *   113.3 years old: 5.3
    *   115.7 years old: 5.2
*   **Context:** HbA1c significantly increases with age.
*   **Average:** Jirohimon's average HbA1c of 5.2% placed him in a range comparable to individuals in their twenties to thirties, 80-90 years younger than his chronological age.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** A meta-analysis indicated no increased risk for HbA1c values around 5.3% (reference) up to approximately 5.5-5.8%. Values greater than 6% were associated with significantly increased risk.
*   **Conclusion:** Jirohimon's HbA1c levels were youthful and indicative of low all-cause mortality risk.

### White Blood Cells (WBC)
*   **Context:** Data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (2,300-2,800 participants followed for >40 years) assessed median survival based on baseline WBC count.
*   **Median Survival by WBC Count:**
    *   3,500 - 6,000 cells/µL: ~37 years
    *   6,000 - 10,000 cells/µL: ~30 years
    *   > 10,000 cells/µL: ~25 years
    *   ≤ 3,500 cells/µL: No median survival (all deceased within 22 years)
*   **Jirohimon's Data:** All three of his measurements fell within the 3,500 - 6,000 cells/µL range.
*   **Caveat:** Changes in specific WBC subtypes (e.g., declining lymphocytes, increasing neutrophils with age) were not available to assess.
*   **Conclusion:** Jirohimon's WBC count was within the range associated with the longest life expectancy.

### C-Reactive Protein (CRP) - Inflammation
*   **Jirohimon's Data (mg/dL, converted to mg/L by multiplying by 10):**
    *   Age ~111-112: 0.3 mg/L (outstandingly low)
    *   Age ~113.3: Increased six-fold (1.8 mg/L)
    *   Age ~115.7: Increased ten-fold (3.0 mg/L)
*   **Context (High-Sensitivity CRP vs. Age):** CRP generally increases with age.
*   **Context (CRP vs. All-Cause Mortality Risk):**
    *   Reference: < 0.21 mg/L
    *   0.21 - 0.43 mg/L: Not significantly different from reference (low risk). Jirohimon's first measurement (0.3 mg/L) fell here.
    *   > 1.02 mg/L: Significantly increased risk. Jirohimon's later measurements (1.8 and 3.0 mg/L) fell into higher risk categories.
*   **Conclusion:** While Jirohimon had very low inflammation at age 112, his CRP levels increased significantly in his final years, indicating heightened inflammation closer to his death. The long-term pattern of his CRP is unknown.

### Triglycerides
*   **Context (Meta-analysis of 61 studies):** All-cause mortality risk significantly increases with higher triglyceride levels. Levels < 90 mg/dL are associated with maximally reduced risk.
*   **Jirohimon's Data:** All of his measurements were less than 90 mg/dL.
*   **Context (Centenarian Studies):** In 11 centenarian studies, triglycerides were typically < 101 mg/dL. In one study, 109-year-olds had an average of 93 mg/dL.
*   **Conclusion:** Jirohimon's triglyceride levels were in the range associated with lowest all-cause mortality risk and are consistent with a hallmark of longevity.

### HDL Cholesterol
*   **Context:** HDL peaks in youth (~56 mg/dL) and declines, stabilizing around 50 mg/dL in older adults.
*   **Jirohimon's Average HDL:** 61.3 mg/dL.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** The 50-60 mg/dL range was associated with the lowest all-cause mortality risk in a large study.
*   **Conclusion:** Jirohimon's HDL levels were closer to youthful levels than to the average for his age group and were associated with low all-cause mortality risk.

## Kidney Function Markers

### Creatinine
*   **Jirohimon's Data (mg/dL):**
    *   First two measurements: 0.76 and 0.83
    *   Third measurement: 0.58
*   **Context (All-Cause Mortality Risk):** Levels between approximately 0.7 and 1.0 mg/dL are associated with near-lowest risk in a study of 31,000 people. Levels < 0.5 or > 1.5 mg/dL increase risk.
*   **Caveats:**
    *   Creatinine levels generally increase with age due to declining kidney function.
    *   Creatinine levels are proportional to muscle mass; declining muscle mass with age can lead to lower creatinine, potentially masking kidney decline.
*   **Conclusion:** Creatinine data is **incomplete** as a marker of kidney function due to the confounding effects of age-related muscle mass decline and potential changes in kidney filtration.

### Cystatin C
*   **Jirohimon's Data (mg/L):** 1.32 (at age 115)
*   **Context:** Cystatin C is a better marker of kidney function in older adults as it is less sensitive to muscle mass changes. Levels increase with age and indicate poorer kidney function.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:**
    *   < 0.7 mg/L: Best survival
    *   Up to 1.08 mg/L: Intermediate survival
    *   > 1.08 mg/L: Worst survival
*   **Conclusion:** Jirohimon's Cystatin C level of 1.32 mg/L indicated aged and unhealthy kidney function, placing him at the highest risk for all-cause mortality based on this marker.

### Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)
*   **Jirohimon's Average Data (mg/dL):** 27.7
*   **Context:** BUN increases with age (approaching 24 mg/dL in individuals >90 years old) and can also increase with higher dietary protein intake. Assuming stable diet, it reflects kidney function.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** Higher BUN levels are associated with significantly increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Conclusion:** Jirohimon's BUN levels were significantly elevated above the typical aged range, indicating poor kidney function and a substantially increased risk for all-cause mortality.

## Other Biomarkers

### Albumin
*   **Jirohimon's Data (g/dL):** 3.5, 3.6, 2.9
*   **Context:** Albumin levels decline with age (around 3.6 g/dL for 100-year-olds, compared to ~4.6 g/dL in youth). Higher albumin is associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk.
*   **All-Cause Mortality Risk:** Higher albumin levels consistently showed significantly reduced all-cause mortality risk across different age groups, with a stronger association than HDL, LDL, HbA1c, creatinine, or CRP.
*   **Conclusion:** Jirohimon's albumin levels were relatively low and indicative of an increased all-cause mortality risk.

### Red Blood Cells (RBC)
*   **Jirohimon's Data (converted from x10^6/µL to relevant scale):** ~3.9, ~4.4, ~4.27, ~3.89 (average ~4.1)
*   **Context:** RBC count declines with age (youth ~4.8; approaching 100 years < 4.0).
*   **Conclusion:** Jirohimon's red blood cell count was at age-appropriate levels, not indicative of youthful health.
