# 2023-10-29 Telomere Length Test 5 in 2023 - Which Dietary Factors Are Significantly Correlated

## Executive Summary

*   Telomere length naturally declines with age, with an optimal goal of maintaining levels near or above 7.6 kilobases (kb).
*   The speaker's average telomere length in 2023 (7.13 kb over 5 tests) significantly increased compared to 2022 (7.04 kb over 3 tests, p < 0.05).
*   Across the speaker's data, calorie intake showed a significant inverse correlation with telomere length; lower calorie intake correlated with longer telomeres.
*   After statistically adjusting for total calorie intake, only Parmesan cheese consumption remained significantly inversely correlated with shorter telomere length (p < 0.05).
*   Other initially correlated macro/micronutrients (e.g., vitamin B1, selenium, total fructose) and foods (e.g., low-fat yogurt, cacao beans) lost statistical significance after adjusting for calorie intake.

## Telomere Length Trends & Goals

In a TrueDiagnostic cohort, telomere length was plotted against chronological age, demonstrating an age-related decline. In youth, telomere length averages 7.6 to 7.75 kilobases (kb). For individuals older than 80, telomere length shortens to less than 6.6 kb. Thus, telomere length declines during aging. The goal for optimal health is to avoid age-related decline and maintain telomere length as close to 7.6 kilobases or longer.

## Personal Telomere Length Data

The speaker's fifth telomere test data, from August 21, 2023, was obtained via TrueDiagnostic. For this fifth test, telomere length was 7.1 kilobases, which is aligned with the expected length for the speaker's chronological age. The speaker's personal goal is to maintain telomere length relatively youthful for their chronological age.

Comparing this 7.11 kilobases result with previous tests, the data shows:
*   Over three tests in 2022, the average telomere length was 7.04 kilobases.
*   In 2023, over the first five tests, the average increased to 7.13 kilobases.
A two-sample t-test revealed a statistically significant increase in 2023 data relative to 2022 (p < 0.05).

## Dietary Factors Correlated with Telomere Length

To identify contributing factors impacting telomere length, correlations with dietary intake were analyzed over eight tests.

### Calorie Intake

Telomere length was plotted against average daily calorie intake. This average daily calorie intake represents the period between the previous telomere test and the day before the subsequent test. The methodology for dietary tracking involved:
*   Weighing all food daily.
*   Logging data into Cronometer.
*   Calculating the average daily intake for the period between tests.
*   Correlating this average intake with the telomere length result of the latter test.

Analysis revealed a significant inverse correlation between telomere length and calorie intake. Higher calorie intake was significantly correlated with shorter telomere length, while lower calorie intake was significantly correlated with longer telomere length.

### Macro and Micronutrients

To investigate diet composition, correlations between 42 macro- and micronutrients and telomere length were analyzed. Initially, several nutrients showed a statistically significant correlation (p < 0.05). The correlation coefficient (r) indicates the direction: positive 'r' means higher nutrient levels correlate with longer telomeres, negative 'r' means higher nutrient levels correlate with shorter telomeres. These initial correlations were unadjusted for calorie intake.

To determine if these correlations were independent of calorie intake, statistical models were adjusted to include calorie intake. After adjusting for calorie intake, previously significant correlations for several nutrients were no longer statistically significant: vitamin B1 (p = 0.06), selenium (p = 0.11), and total fructose (p = 0.12). This indicates that the initial correlations for these macro- and micronutrients were largely confounded by calorie intake.

### Specific Foods

Beyond macro- and micronutrients, correlations for 48 specific foods with telomere length were examined. Initial unadjusted correlations identified several statistically significant associations (p < 0.05). The next step was to adjust these correlations for calorie intake.

*   **Parmesan cheese:** After adjusting for calorie intake, Parmesan cheese intake remained significantly correlated with shorter telomere length (p < 0.05). This suggests that higher Parmesan cheese intake is independently correlated with shorter telomere length.
*   **Low-fat yogurt:** After adjusting for calorie intake, low-fat yogurt was no longer significantly correlated with telomere length (p = 0.06).
*   **Cacao beans:** Cacao bean intake (consumed as homemade chocolate mixed with Medjool dates), after adjusting for calorie intake, was also not significantly correlated with telomere length (p = 0.13).

## Future Plans

Given that Parmesan cheese was the only dietary factor to remain significantly correlated with telomere length after adjusting for calorie intake, the speaker plans to reduce its consumption. The impact of this change will be evaluated in telomere length test number 7, scheduled for November 2023, with results expected in January.
