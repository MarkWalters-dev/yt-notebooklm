# 2023-04-02 Serine + Vitamin B6 - The Best Way To Reduce Homocysteine Also Homocysteine Activates mTORC1

## Executive Summary
*   Homocysteine concentration is positively correlated with the phosphorylation levels of p70 S6 kinase (p-p70 S6K), indicating that **homocysteine activates mTORC1**.
*   Traditional homocysteine reduction strategies using folate, B12, or trimethylglycine (betaine) increase methionine, which may be detrimental to longevity since **methionine restriction extends lifespan**.
*   Supplementation with **Serine and Vitamin B6** appears to reduce homocysteine by shunting it into the cysteine pathway, leading to glutathione (GSH) production.
*   Centenarians exhibit significantly lower plasma methionine levels compared to younger, 67-year-old individuals, supporting the concept that **lower methionine is associated with extreme longevity**.
*   Vitamin B6 is involved in the *de novo* synthesis of NAD, suggesting that adequate B6 supplementation might indirectly support NAD levels.

## mTORC1 Inhibition and Lifespan
Rapamycin extends median lifespan in male and female mice when initiated at midlife (approximately 600 days). A primary mechanism involves the inhibition of mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1).

Hyperactive mTORC1 is linked to several adverse health outcomes during aging, including:
*   Hypertension
*   Obesity
*   Dyslipidemia
*   Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
*   Neurodegeneration
*   Cancer

## Homocysteine as an mTORC1 Biomarker
mTORC1 activity can be tracked by increased phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase (p-p70 S6K). Homocysteine levels are related to this activity:

**Homocysteine Concentration $\rightarrow$ Increased p-p70 S6K Levels $\rightarrow$ mTORC1 Activation**

Plasma levels of total homocysteine increase significantly with age in both males and females (data spanning ages 12 to over 80). In a study of centenarians (median age 100), serum homocysteine levels reached $23.1 \mu M$, nearly double the levels seen in the general aging population shown previously.

## Homocysteine Metabolism Pathways

### 1. Methionine-Increasing Pathway (Traditional Approach)
This pathway utilizes folate, B12, or betaine (trimethylglycine) to convert homocysteine back to methionine.

**Folate/B12 Pathway:**
Dietary Folate $\rightarrow$ Serum Folate $\xrightarrow{\text{B12}}$ Homocysteine $\rightarrow$ Methionine

**Betaine Pathway:**
Betaine (Trimethylglycine) (Choline also feeds here) + Homocysteine $\rightarrow$ Methionine

*Critique:* Methionine restriction extends lifespan in animals, and human centenarians (average age 97) exhibited significantly lower plasma methionine compared to their 67-year-old offspring. Therefore, increasing methionine is potentially counterproductive for longevity.

### 2. Serine/B6 Pathway (Proposed Approach)
This strategy aims to shunt homocysteine away from methionine production toward cysteine production.

**Serine/B6 Pathway:**
Homocysteine + Serine $\xrightarrow{\text{B6}}$ Cystathionine $\xrightarrow{\text{B6}}$ Cysteine $\rightarrow$ Glutathione (GSH)

*Benefit:* Increased glutathione (GSH) during aging is potentially beneficial, as GSH restoration has been shown to improve health-related outcomes in randomized controlled trials.

This pathway may also influence hydrogen sulfide ($\text{H}_2\text{S}$), which may act as a sulfur donor, potentially increasing the conversion of DHEA to DHEA sulfate.

## Proposed Supplementation Protocol
The protocol aims to reduce homocysteine and potentially increase DHEA sulfate using low doses:
*   **Serine:** 2 grams per day
*   **Vitamin B6:** 5 milligrams per day

The initial trial period is set for a few weeks, with a potential plan to double both dosages if initial results are inconclusive, provided biomarkers do not trend negatively.

## Vitamin B6 and NAD Synthesis
Vitamin B6 is involved in the *de novo* synthesis of $\text{NAD}^+$. A potential secondary outcome of increased B6 supplementation is monitoring for an impact on intracellular $\text{NAD}$ levels, even without direct supplementation of $\text{NMN}$ or $\text{NR}$.
