# 2024-01-07 Tea Consumption Is Associated With Slower Biological Aging

## Executive Summary
*   Daily tea consumption, specifically 2-3 cups, was consistently associated with a slower biological age acceleration across two independent cohort studies (China Multi-Ethnic Cohort and UK Biobank).
*   The biological age acceleration metric (KDM method) used in these studies demonstrated a linear correlation with chronological age.
*   An older biological age, as determined by this metric, was significantly associated with an increased risk for all-cause mortality and specific cause-specific mortalities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and lung disease.
*   The biological age metric incorporated a diverse panel of biomarkers, covering multiple organ systems, which contributes to its robustness.

## Cohort Studies & Tea Consumption Findings

This study investigated the association between tea consumption and biological aging, utilizing data from two large cohort studies. Tea consumption included white, green, yellow, oolong, black, dark, sweet, or unscented tea.

### China Multi-Ethnic Cohort (CMEK)
*   **Participants:** Approximately 8,000 individuals
*   **Median Age:** 51 years
*   **Findings:**
    *   Compared to consistent non-drinkers, individuals consuming less than one cup of tea per day showed similar biological age acceleration.
    *   Individuals reporting two to three cups and greater than four cups of tea per day exhibited a slower biological age acceleration over the course of the study.

### UK Biobank (UKB)
*   **Participants:** Approximately 6,000 individuals
*   **Median Age:** 59 years
*   **Findings:**
    *   Compared to consistent non-drinkers, individuals consuming less than one cup of tea per day showed similar biological age acceleration.
    *   Individuals reporting two to three cups of tea per day showed a slower biological age acceleration over the course of the study, consistent with the CMEK findings.
    *   For those consuming greater than four cups of tea per day, the association with biological age acceleration was not statistically significant.

### Summary of Tea Consumption Impact
Across both studies, a consistent association was observed between consuming **two to three cups of tea per day** (or six to eight grams of tea by weight) and a slower biological age acceleration.

## Validation of the Biological Age Metric

The study addressed critical questions regarding the biological age metric's quality, potential for healthy user bias, and included biomarkers.

### Correlation with Chronological Age
*   The biological age derived for both CMEK and UK Biobank showed linear correlations with chronological age.
*   While specific correlation coefficients were not reported for these studies, the visual slope of the correlation was comparable to Morgan Levine's PhenoAge, which has a reported correlation coefficient of 0.96 with chronological age. This suggests a strong correlation for the KDM biological age metric.

### Association with Mortality Risk
An older biological age, as measured by the KDM method, was significantly associated with an increased risk for all-cause and cause-specific mortality.

#### UK Biobank: All-Cause Mortality Risk
*   **Full Cohort:** Biological age acceleration (where biological age was older than chronological age) was associated with a 56% higher risk for all-cause mortality.
*   **Women:** 46% higher risk.
*   **Men:** 60% higher risk.

#### CMEK: Cause-Specific Mortality Risk
*   **Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Mortality:** Biological age acceleration was associated with a 10% higher risk (13% in women, 9% in men).
*   **Diabetes-Related Mortality:** Biological age acceleration was associated with a 15% higher risk (18% in women, 15% in men).
*   **Lung Disease (COPD) Mortality:** Biological age acceleration was associated with a 3% higher risk in the total cohort, with a significant effect observed in men.
*   **Cancer Mortality:** No significant association with biological age acceleration was found in the total cohort, women, or men.

### Adjustment for Healthy User Bias
The study adjusted for a wide range of variables to account for potential healthy user bias, including:
*   Demographic factors (e.g., age, sex, education, income, ethnicity).
*   Lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, diet).
*   Physician-diagnosed chronic diseases (e.g., cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, COPD).
However, it was noted that adjustments for other chronic conditions such as liver disease, kidney disease, and Alzheimer's disease were not included.

## Biomarkers Included in the Biological Age Metric

The KDM biological age metric integrated biomarkers from multiple organ systems, enhancing its comprehensive assessment of biological age.

### CMEK Biomarkers (15 Total)
Each of these biomarkers was significantly correlated with chronological age and included in the biological age acceleration metric:
*   **Vascular Health:** Systolic Blood Pressure
*   **Adiposity:** Waist-to-Hip Ratio
*   **Lung Function:** Peak Expiratory Flow
*   **Metabolic Health:**
    *   HbA1c (Glycated Hemoglobin)
    *   LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein)
    *   Triglycerides
    *   HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein)
*   **Liver Health:**
    *   GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transpeptidase)
    *   Albumin
    *   AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)
    *   Alkaline Phosphatase
*   **Red Blood Cell Size:** MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume)
*   **Immune Function/Blood Clotting:** Platelet Count
*   **Kidney Function:**
    *   Urea
    *   Creatinine

### UK Biobank Biomarkers (18 Total)
Many biomarkers overlapped with the CMEK study, while others were unique to the UK Biobank dataset. All 18 biomarkers were significantly correlated with chronological age.

*   **Overlapping Biomarkers (Examples):** Systolic Blood Pressure, Waist-to-Hip Ratio, HbA1c, LDL, Triglycerides, HDL, GGT, Albumin, AST, Alkaline Phosphatase, MCV, Platelet Count, Urea, Creatinine.

*   **Additional/Unique Biomarkers in UK Biobank:**
    *   **Adiposity:** Body Fat Percentage
    *   **Bone Health/Fracture Risk:** HEAL Quantitative Ultrasound Index
    *   **Bone Health:** Vitamin D
    *   **Kidney Function:**
        *   Cystatin C

    *   **Inflammation:** C-Reactive Protein
    *   **Liver Health/Metabolic Processes:** IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 1)

## Summary of Findings
Tea consumption, specifically two to three cups per day, was consistently linked to a slower biological age acceleration in two distinct cohort studies. The biological age metric employed for this assessment was robust, demonstrating a strong correlation with chronological age and a significant association with increased risks for all-cause and various cause-specific mortalities. Furthermore, the metric's utility is supported by its incorporation of a diverse panel of biomarkers, representing numerous organ systems.
