# 2020-06-28 Is hesperidin essential for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 Infection

## Executive Summary

*   Hesperidin has been shown in virtual screening studies to be a strong inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 virus entry into cells by blocking spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor.
*   In vitro studies indicate hesperidin can upregulate the interferon MAP kinase pathway, which is crucial for cellular immunity against viral infections, although direct studies on SARS-CoV-2 are pending.
*   Hesperidin has demonstrated the ability to inhibit key pro-inflammatory molecules implicated in the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19, including interleukins 1 beta, 2, and 6, interferon gamma, and TNF alpha.
*   Hesperidin is found in significant concentrations in whole foods such as lemons, oranges (navel and blood varieties), and peppermint leaves.

## Proposed Mechanisms of Action for Hesperidin in COVID-19

The paper proposes three main ways hesperidin may prevent or treat coronavirus infection:

1.  **Inhibition of Viral Entry:**
    *   **Process:** SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins bind to the ACE2 receptor, facilitating viral entry into host cells. This triggers cellular machinery to produce more virus, leading to immune activation and an excessive inflammatory response.
    *   **Hesperidin's Role:** Virtual screening studies have shown hesperidin to be a strong inhibitor of this process, thereby preventing SARS-CoV-2 from entering cells.

2.  **Enhancement of Cellular Immunity:**
    *   **Process:** Hesperidin has been shown in vitro to upregulate the interferon MAP kinase pathway. This pathway is involved in increasing cellular immunity against infections.
    *   **Current Status:** While this effect was observed with influenza A virus, direct studies investigating hesperidin's ability to upregulate this pathway for SARS-CoV-2 immunity are yet to be conducted. However, data suggests the MAP kinase pathway is important for survival in COVID-19 patients.

3.  **Mitigation of Cytokine Storm:**
    *   **Process:** The cytokine storm, characterized by an immune overreaction to infection, involves the release of pro-inflammatory molecules such as interleukin 1 beta, interleukins 2 and 6, interferon gamma, and TNF alpha.
    *   **Hesperidin's Role:** Hesperidin has been shown in various studies (not specific to COVID-19) to inhibit each of these pro-inflammatory molecules, suggesting a potential role in mitigating the cytokine storm in COVID-19.

## Current Evidence and Limitations

*   No randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have yet investigated the ability of hesperidin to perform these actions specifically in the context of COVID-19 infection.
*   The proposed benefits are based on in vitro studies, virtual screenings, and data from other inflammatory conditions.

## Dietary Sources of Hesperidin

Hesperidin is found in relatively high concentrations in the following foods:

*   **Lemons**
*   **Oranges** (including navel/blonde and blood oranges)
*   **Peppermint**

## Hesperidin Content in Foods (Data from Phenol-Explorer.eu)

*   **Lemon Juice:** Contains a decent amount of hesperidin.
*   **Navel Oranges (Blonde Oranges) Juice:** Contains a decent amount of hesperidin.
*   **Blood Oranges Juice:** Contains a decent amount of hesperidin.
*   **Dried Peppermint Leaves:** Contains the highest concentration on the list (481 mg per 100g).

**Note on Peppermint:**
*   Consuming 100g of dried peppermint is impractical.
*   1 gram of dried peppermint is equivalent to approximately 4 grams of fresh peppermint.
*   Therefore, the hesperidin content in fresh peppermint leaves can be estimated by dividing the dried value by 4 (approx. 120 mg per 100g of fresh peppermint leaves).

The speaker reports consuming approximately 70 grams of fresh peppermint in smoothies to increase their dietary intake of hesperidin. The preference is for whole foods over supplements or concentrates.
