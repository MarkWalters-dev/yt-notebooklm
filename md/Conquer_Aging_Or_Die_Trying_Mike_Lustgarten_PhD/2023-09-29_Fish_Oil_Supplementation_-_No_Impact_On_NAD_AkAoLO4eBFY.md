# 2023-09-29 Fish Oil Supplementation - No Impact On NAD

## Executive Summary

*   Aging is associated with a dysfunctional de novo NAD synthesis pathway, evidenced by increasing quinolinic acid and declining NAD levels.
*   A potential age-related block in the conversion of quinolinic acid to NAD exists, possibly at the QAPRT enzyme.
*   Fish oil supplementation (2.1 grams/day of omega-3, including EPA and DHA, for 18 days) did not increase NAD levels.
*   The tested NAD level during fish oil supplementation was 18.5 µmol/L, which was below the baseline NAD of 20-25 µmol/L.
*   Future testing will explore lower doses of nicotinic acid to increase NAD without negatively impacting other biomarkers.

## Background: NAD Synthesis and Aging

During aging, the de novo NAD synthesis pathway becomes dysfunctional. This is observed through an increase in quinolinic acid and a concurrent decline in NAD levels. This suggests a potential block in the conversion of quinolinic acid to NAD, likely at the QAPRT enzyme.

**De Novo NAD Synthesis Pathway (Potential Age-Related Blockage):**

Quinolinic Acid -> (QAPRT) -> NAMN -> ... -> NAD

Previous hypotheses suggested increasing QAPRT activity or levels could enhance NAD production.

## Fish Oil Supplementation Study

### Methodology

*   **Supplementation:** 2.1 grams/day of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil (including EPA and DHA).
*   **Duration:** 18 days prior to testing.
*   **Baseline Fish Intake:** Maintained baseline intake, primarily from sardines.
*   **NAD Analysis:** Blood sent to Ginfinity for NAD quantification.

### Results

*   **NAD Level Post-Supplementation:** 18.5 µmol/L.
*   **Baseline NAD Level:** 20-25 µmol/L.

### Conclusion

Fish oil supplementation at 2.1 grams/day for 18 days **did not** increase NAD levels. In fact, the measured NAD level was below the individual's baseline.

## Future Plans: Nicotinic Acid Supplementation

The next step involves returning to nicotinic acid supplementation. Nicotinic acid can be converted to NAD through three enzymatic steps. Past experience indicates that 654 mg/day of nicotinic acid previously raised NAD to a high of 67 µmol/L. However, this high dose may have negatively impacted epigenetic aging markers.

The new plan aims to identify the lowest effective dose of nicotinic acid that can raise NAD without adverse effects on other biomarkers.

### Proposed Protocol

*   **Nicotinic Acid Dose:** 100 mg/day total (60 mg from NA, 40 mg from diet).
*   **Testing Date:** October 2nd.
*   **Objective:** Determine if this dose is sufficient for an NAD boost and, if not, gradually increase to find the optimal lower limit.
