# 2023-05-10 Serine + Vitamin B6 - Did It Reduce Homocysteine Test 1

## Executive Summary

*   Homocysteine can be metabolized via two main pathways: the methionine pathway (folate, vitamin B12, betaine) or the cystathionine pathway (serine, vitamin B6).
*   The methionine pathway, while reducing homocysteine, may be associated with negative longevity outcomes due to increased methionine metabolism.
*   The cystathionine pathway (serine + vitamin B6) converts homocysteine into cystathionine, which then leads to the production of glutathione (GSH), beneficial for health and potentially longevity.
*   An intervention with 2 grams/day of serine and 11 milligrams/day of vitamin B6 reduced homocysteine levels from 11.1 micromolar to 10.1 micromolar.
*   The observed homocysteine reduction may be within normal physiological variation, as past test results have shown similar values around 10 micromolar without supplementation.

## Homocysteine Metabolic Pathways

Homocysteine is a key metabolite with two primary conversion pathways:

**1. Methionine Pathway (Remethylation)**

This pathway converts homocysteine back into methionine, reducing circulating homocysteine concentration. However, increased methionine metabolism may be detrimental to longevity based on studies in animal models of methionine restriction.

Dietary Folic Acid -> Serum Folate + Vitamin B12 -> Homocysteine -> Methionine
OR
Betaine (Trimethylglycine) -> Homocysteine -> Methionine

**2. Cystathionine Pathway (Transsulfuration)**

This pathway converts homocysteine into cystathionine, ultimately contributing to glutathione production. Glutathione restoration, which declines during aging, may be beneficial for health and potentially longevity.

Homocysteine + Serine + Vitamin B6 -> Cystathionine -> Cystine + Vitamin B6 -> Glutathione (GSH)

## Serine + Vitamin B6 Intervention Protocol

For blood test number three in 2023, a specific regimen of serine and vitamin B6 was implemented to assess its impact on homocysteine levels.

*   **Duration:** Preceding blood test #3 (specific duration not stated, but implies a period leading up to the test).
*   **Serine Dosage:** 2 grams per day.
*   **Vitamin B6 Dosage:** 11 milligrams per day (approximately 3.5 times higher than the previous average intake of 3 milligrams per day).

## Homocysteine Test Results and Analysis

**Results:**

*   **Pre-intervention (Test 2):** Homocysteine was 11.1 micromolar.
*   **Post-intervention (Test 3):** Homocysteine was 10.1 micromolar.

**Analysis:**

While there was a reduction in homocysteine from 11.1 to 10.1 micromolar, it is uncertain if this represents significant progress or merely normal physiological variation. A review of 32 homocysteine blood tests since 2005 reveals several previous instances where homocysteine levels were around 10 micromolar, even without additional vitamin B6, B12, or folate supplementation. Therefore, the 10.1 micromolar result could fall within this established range of normal variation.

Additionally, the combination of serine and vitamin B6 did not significantly impact other measured blood biomarkers.

## Future Experiment Plan

To further investigate the impact of serine and vitamin B6 on homocysteine, the dosages will be increased for blood test number four in 2023:

*   **Serine Intake:** Doubled to 4 grams per day.
*   **Vitamin B6 Intake:** Tripled to 30 milligrams per day (10 times higher than the initial average intake of 3 milligrams per day).
