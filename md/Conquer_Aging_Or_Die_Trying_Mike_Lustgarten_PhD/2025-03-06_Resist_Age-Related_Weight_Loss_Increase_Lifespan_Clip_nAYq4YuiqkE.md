# 2025-03-06 Resist Age-Related Weight Loss Increase Lifespan Clip

## Executive Summary

*   Mice that lost body weight experienced shorter lifespans.
*   Interventions like 40% Caloric Restriction (CR) led to significant weight loss in mice, correlating with reduced lifespan.
*   The general trend observed across different intervention groups is that weight loss is associated with a decreased lifespan.

## Mouse Data

The body weight of mice naturally increases between six months and approximately eighteen to twenty months of age.

*   **Ad libitum fed mice:** Showed a typical increase in body weight over this period, with variations between individual mice.
*   **40% Caloric Restriction (CR) mice:** Almost universally lost body weight.

Analysis of individual mice revealed a correlation:

*   Mice that lost more weight exhibited shorter lifespans.
*   This association between weight loss and reduced lifespan was observed across various intervention groups.
