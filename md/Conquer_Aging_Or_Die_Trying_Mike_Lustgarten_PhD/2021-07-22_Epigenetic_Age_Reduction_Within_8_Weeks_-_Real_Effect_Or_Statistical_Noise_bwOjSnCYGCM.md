# 2021-07-22 Epigenetic Age Reduction Within 8 Weeks - Real Effect Or Statistical Noise

## Executive Summary

*   A diet and lifestyle intervention studied over 8 weeks in 38 men (average age 59) aimed to reverse epigenetic age using the Horvath epigenetic clock.
*   The treatment group showed a non-statistically significant reduction of 1.96 years younger epigenetic age compared to baseline ($p=0.66$).
*   When compared against controls, the treatment group achieved a statistically significant improvement, showing an average 3.23 years younger epigenetic age ($p < 0.05$).
*   Crucially, epigenetic age improved for only 44% (8 out of 18) of the subjects in the treatment group; the other 56% experienced either no change or an increase in epigenetic age.
*   The study lacked published data confirming compliance with the extensive dietary and lifestyle protocols, leaving the causality of the observed effect uncertain.

## Study Cohort and Intervention Design

The study was a relatively small trial involving **38 men** with an average age of **59 years**. The applicability of these results to women or other age groups is unknown. The intervention was a comprehensive diet and lifestyle protocol designed to potentially reverse epigenetic age as measured by the Horvath epigenetic clock.

### Dietary and Lifestyle Protocol (Treatment Group Recommendations)

The participants were recommended to follow an intensive daily and weekly regimen:

**Daily Dietary Intake:**
*   Dark leafy greens (e.g., kale, spinach): 2 cups per day.
*   Cruciferous vegetables (e.g., broccoli, cauliflower): 2 cups per day.
*   Colorful, non-starchy vegetables (excluding white potatoes/corn): 3 additional cups per day.
*   Beets: 1 to 2 medium beets per day.
*   Seeds (pumpkin and sunflower): Cumulative total of approximately 60 grams per day (about 400 calories).
*   Animal protein (grass-fed, organic): 8 ounces per day.
*   Low glycemic fruit (e.g., cherries, apples): 2 servings per day.

**Methylation Adaptogens (Minimum 1+ serving/day):**
*   Berries: 1/2 cup per day.
*   Rosemary, Turmeric, Garlic cloves.
*   Green Tea: 2 cups per day (counts as one serving).
*   Oolong Tea: 3 cups per day.

**Weekly Dietary Intake:**
*   Liver: 3 servings per week (1 serving = 3 ounces, totaling 9 ounces/week).
*   Eggs: 5 to 10 per week.

**General Guidance:**
*   Consume organic foods over pesticide-laden options.
*   Ensure adequate hydration.
*   Implement Time-Restricted Feeding (abstaining from food between 7 PM and 7 AM).
*   Balance fat intake, incorporating oils such as coconut, olive, flaxseed, and pumpkin seed oil.
*   Avoid sugar, candy, dairy, grains, and legumes.
*   Minimize the use of plastic food containers.

**Supplementation:**
*   Prebiotic supplement (dried vegetables, fruit, seeds, herbs) to encourage beneficial gut bacteria growth.
*   Probiotics, specifically *Lactobacillus plantarum*, chosen for its ability to increase folate synthesis, which is implicated in the methylation cycle.

**Exercise and Stress Management:**
*   Exercise: 30 minutes per day, five days per week.
*   Sleep: Average of 7 hours per night.
*   Stress Management: Performance of breathing exercises (rationale being that sleep deprivation or chronic stress increases epigenetic age).

## Epigenetic Age Measurement

The choice of epigenetic clock is critical for reliable results. The study utilized **Steve Horvath's epigenetic clock** because it demonstrated the strongest correlation with chronological age across a wide variety of cell types (correlation coefficient of 0.94, superior to other tested clocks).

## Study Results and Statistical Significance

The analysis focused on the change in epigenetic age from baseline to 8 weeks.

1.  **Control Group Change (Baseline vs. 8 Weeks):** Controls experienced an average **1.27 years older** epigenetic age, which was not statistically significant ($p=0.15$).
2.  **Treatment Group Change (Baseline vs. 8 Weeks):** The treatment group experienced an average **1.96 years younger** epigenetic age compared to baseline. However, this result was marginally not statistically significant ($p=0.66$).
3.  **Between-Group Comparison (Treatment vs. Control Change):** Statistical significance was achieved when comparing the changes between the two groups. The treatment group showed an overall **3.23 years younger** epigenetic age compared with controls ($p < 0.05$).

## Individual Response Analysis

Despite the positive finding in the group comparison, individual data revealed significant variability:

*   Epigenetic age improved (became younger) for only **44%** (8 out of 18 subjects) in the treatment group.
*   **Fifty percent** (9 out of 18 subjects) experienced an **unchanged** epigenetic age from baseline to the end of the study.
*   One subject experienced an **older** epigenetic age after the 8-week intervention.

## Conclusion Regarding Causality

The study imposed massive dietary and lifestyle changes, yet compliance tracking data (food intake, exercise logs, etc.) was required for inclusion but was **not published**. This lack of adherence data makes it impossible to confirm if the intervention was consistently followed or if any specific component drove the observed epigenetic changes.

Therefore, the observed 3.23-year reduction in epigenetic age between groups must be questioned as potentially being **statistical noise** rather than a confirmed, robust treatment effect caused by the intervention.
