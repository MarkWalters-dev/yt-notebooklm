# 2022-05-22 Quantifying Biological Age - Blood Test 3 in 2022

## Executive Summary

*   My biological age (Levine's Phenotypic Age) is 35.3 years, 14 years younger than my chronological age of 49.3. My average Phenotypic Age has decreased in 2022 to 34.4 years.
*   Levine's Phenotypic Age is highly validated, showing a 0.94-0.96 correlation with chronological age and predicting a 9% increase in all-cause mortality risk for every biological age year increase.
*   Levine's Phenotypic Age performs comparably to Horvath's epigenetic clock in predicting chronological age (correlation of 0.94 for both).
*   Using Aging.ai 3.3.0, my biological age is 32 years, 17.3 years younger than my chronological age. My average Aging.ai age has also decreased in 2022 to 28.7 years.
*   Both biological age calculators indicate a positive trend in 2022, showing lower average biological ages and greater reductions from chronological age compared to previous years.

## Introduction to Biological Age Testing

Aging and disease are biochemical processes that happen over many decades. Tracking well-established biomarkers of organ and systemic health may slow aging and disease risk. This report details findings from the third blood test conducted in 2022.

## Levine's Phenotypic Age

### My Current Biological Age

*   Using Dr. Morgan Levine's phenotypic age calculator, my biological age is 35.3 years.
*   This is 14 years younger than my chronological age of 49.3 years.
*   Quest high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) measurement was < 0.3 mg/L, which was entered for this test.

### Validity of Levine's Phenotypic Age Calculator

Levine's test is strongly correlated with chronological age.
*   In two separate studies, the correlation for Levine's test with chronological age was:
    *   0.94 in NHANES III (approximately 10,000 subjects).
    *   0.96 in NHANES IV (more than 11,000 subjects).
*   Levine's test is also associated with all-cause mortality risk. For every one-year biological age increase using Levine's test, all-cause mortality risk increases by 9%. Maintaining a more youthful biological age, according to this test, is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality.

### Comparison with Epigenetic Clocks

*   The Horvath test is considered the best-performing epigenetic clock for predicting chronological age.
*   Horvath's multi-tissue epigenetic age clock (including cells from breast, cheek, brain, colon, blood, skin, etc.) shows a correlation coefficient of 0.94 with chronological age.
*   Levine's blood-based biomarker test is as effective as the Horvath test for predicting chronological age.

### My Phenotypic Age Trends (Levine's Test)

*   **Average Biological Age (Years):**
    *   2020 (6 tests): 35.6
    *   2021 (6 tests): 35.6
    *   2022 (3 tests so far): 34.4 (a reduction compared to previous years)

*   **Average Biological Age Reduction Relative to Chronological Age (Years):**
    *   2018-2021 (15 tests): 11.9 years
    *   2022 (3 tests so far): 14.5 years (Test 1: 16.4, Test 2: 13.5, Test 3: 13.6)
    *   This represents an average reduction of an extra 2.6 years in 2022 compared to prior years.

*   *Note:* PhenoAge includes chronological age in its model, which limits the maximum possible biological age reduction. For example, a 60-year-old with youthful biomarkers might show a biological age of approximately 40 years.

## Aging.ai 3.3.0

*   *Note:* Aging.ai does not include chronological age in its model, potentially allowing for greater reductions in biological age.

### Validity of Aging.ai

*   The correlation for Aging.ai's 19 biomarkers with chronological age is 0.8, which is considered a strong correlation.
*   A relatively younger Aging.ai age has been shown to be significantly associated with a reduced all-cause mortality risk.

### My Current Biological Age

*   Using 19 biomarkers, Aging.ai predicts a biological age of 32 years.
*   This is 17.3 years younger than my chronological age.

### My Aging.ai Age Trends

*   **Average Biological Age (Years):**
    *   2009-2013 (3 tests): 32
    *   2016-2021 (27 tests): 29.9
    *   2022 (3 tests so far): 28.7 (a continuous reduction over time)

## Conclusion

Factors contributing to these observed biological age reductions (supplements, fitness, and/or diet) will be discussed in future content.
