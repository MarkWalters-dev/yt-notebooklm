### Executive Summary

*   Dr. Michael Lustgarten's biohacking approach involves rigorous, data-driven optimization of health and longevity, tracking approximately 20-25 basic biomarkers (e.g., chem panel, CBC) up to seven times a year.
*   His strategy includes meticulously correlating dietary intake (weighing all food, recording nutrient content) and fitness metrics (using WHOOP for heart rate variability and resting heart rate) with biomarker changes to identify personalized optimal ranges for macronutrients and micronutrients.
*   Current dietary composition associated with his most youthful biomarker profile is approximately 40% total fat (including fiber-derived short-chain fatty acids), 40% net carbohydrates, and 18% protein, all adjusted based on individual biomarker responses.
*   He hypothesizes that reducing body fat percentage (currently 8-9%, targeting 6%) is a significant factor in the observed reduction of his DunedinPACE epigenetic age.
*   Sleep optimization is considered the most critical and challenging aspect, involving strict sleep hygiene (consistent bedtime, blackout room, earplugs, early eating window) which has led to an increase in deep sleep from 5% (measured in his early 30s) to 20-25%.

## Introduction to Biohacking Philosophy

Dr. Michael Lustgarten is a scientist at the Tufts Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, focusing on the gut microbiome, serum metabolome, muscle mass, and function in older adults. His personal goal is to optimize his health to live longer than anyone in history, a pursuit he terms "biohacking." This involves continuously optimizing blood biomarkers, blood pressure, oral microbiome, and other health indicators, a practice he has maintained for over eight years.

His interest in biomarker tracking began in 2008, initially tracking blood tests annually. This approach evolved from an early exposure to Dr. Roy Walford's work on calorie restriction and its impact on lifespan in animal models, as well as human biomarker data from the Biosphere 2 experiment. This ignited a passion for the intersection of blood biomarkers, aging, and longevity.

A core premise of this approach is self-empowerment through data. Instead of solely relying on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or animal studies, individuals can test and track their own biomarkers to assess the net benefit, neutrality, or detriment of lifestyle interventions, including supplements.

## Defining Aging

Aging is defined as the progressive deterioration of organ and systemic function over time. While the classification of aging as a disease is a matter of ongoing debate, Lustgarten leans towards considering it a disease, emphasizing that humans have not evolved the genetics for immortality. However, human cognitive capacity allows for the development of tools and strategies to potentially overcome these genetic limitations within a lifetime. He previously published a paper highlighting the role of the microbiome in aging, noting its eventual inclusion as a hallmark of aging.

## Biomarker Tracking Strategy

Dr. Lustgarten implements a comprehensive and iterative biomarker tracking strategy:

*   **Baseline and Monitoring:** Started with standard chemistry panels and complete blood counts (CBCs), which typically cost around $35-$50. These panels provide a broad overview of health, including markers for metabolic health (glucose, lipids), kidney and liver function, and immune cells.
*   **Expansion to Longevity Markers:** Incorporated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HSCRP) following the publication of the PhenoAge epigenetic clock.
*   **Epigenetic and Telomere Testing:** Expanded tracking to include DNA epigenetic methylation tests (Horvath, Hannum, DunedinPACE clocks) and telomere length, collaborating with companies providing these services.
*   **Microbiome Analysis:** Included oral microbiome analysis to address personal oral health issues, aiming to optimize it as much as possible.
*   **Frequency:** Biomarkers are tested up to seven times a year to closely monitor responses to interventions.
*   **Correlation and Adjustment:** After each blood test, correlations between dietary intake (tracked meticulously since 2015) and fitness metrics (tracked for five years) with biomarker values are recalculated. Dietary and lifestyle interventions are then modified to push the net effect of all biomarkers in a positive direction.
*   **Holistic Optimization:** The goal is to optimize the overall biomarker profile, not just individual markers. For instance, an intervention that lowers glucose but negatively impacts seven other biomarkers would not be adopted.
*   **Individualized Approach:** Recognizing that human studies are complex and controlling for a single variable is difficult, the strategy involves optimizing all identified positive correlations in diet and minimizing negative ones, acknowledging that this may lose some information but is more feasible than a strictly one-variable-at-a-time academic approach.

## Dietary Optimization

His current dietary profile, determined through continuous correlation with biomarker data, is:

*   **Total Fat:** Approximately 40% of calories (includes fiber, which is converted to short-chain fatty acids and can be considered in the fat category).
*   **Net Carbohydrates:** Approximately 40% of calories.
*   **Protein:** Approximately 18% of calories.

This composition is specifically associated with his most youthful biomarker profile. High-fat diets (above 40% of calories) were observed to negatively impact more blood biomarkers than they improved.

## Body Composition and Epigenetic Age

*   **Lean Body Mass Goal:** Has consistently aimed for a very lean body composition, working towards 6% body fat from a previous 12%, currently around 8-9%.
*   **DunedinPACE Correlation:** This reduction in body weight and body fat percentage is hypothesized to be a key driver for the observed sequential decrease in his DunedinPACE epigenetic age with almost every test. This aligns with observations in other highly lean individuals who report low DunedinPACE scores.

## Exercise and Physical Activity

*   **Personalized Training:** Fitness metrics (heart rate variability, resting heart rate, average daily heart rate) are tracked using a wearable (WHOOP) to tailor exercise frequency, intensity, and recovery.
*   **Overtraining Avoidance:** Prior to tracking fitness metrics, he experienced chronic overtraining, with cardiovascular fitness metrics resembling those of a sedentary individual despite high activity levels. Monitoring allows for adjusting training to avoid excessive stress, recognizing that elevated heart rate on non-workout days indicates insufficient recovery.
*   **Workout Structure:** A typical 80-minute workout session includes:
    *   Compound movements (overhead press, pull-ups, deadlifts, with caution due to a past injury).
    *   Calisthenics.
    *   Taekwondo-related movements.
    *   Mobility, balance, and flexibility exercises.
*   **Movement Quality:** The goal is to maintain youthful movement patterns and gait, minimizing age-related deterioration in physical movement.
*   **Epigenetic Age & Exercise:** While his current Horvath age aligns with his chronological age, he notes that elite athletes sometimes exhibit faster intrinsic (Horvath-related) epigenetic ages, possibly due to compounded oxidative stress leading to inflammation. This suggests the importance of a variety of movements rather than repetitive, high-stress exercises, incorporating activities like walking, weightlifting, yoga, and Taekwondo.

## Sleep Optimization

Sleep is considered the most challenging but crucial aspect to optimize:

*   **Sleep Hygiene Protocol:**
    *   Consistent bedtime every night.
    *   Room completely blacked out to prevent any light exposure.
    *   Earplugs used to block out noise, preventing awakenings.
    *   Early eating window: The majority of calories consumed earlier in the day, with a 6-hour minimum fasting window before a 9 PM bedtime. This minimizes nocturnal awakenings due to digestion.
*   **Improved Deep Sleep:** A polysomnography study in his early 30s showed only 5% of total sleep time in deep sleep (typical of an 80-year-old). With optimized sleep hygiene, WHOOP data (found comparable to PSG for deep sleep) now indicates 20-25% deep sleep.
*   **Challenges:** Despite improvements, he still frequently wakes up 3-5 hours after falling asleep, often requiring meditation to return to sleep. Sleep debt of even 30-60 minutes over a few days can significantly affect mental and physical performance.

## Untracked Biomarkers / Future Directions

*   **Hormones (DHEA sulfate):** Lustgarten regrets not tracking hormone levels, particularly DHEA sulfate, earlier in life. His DHEA sulfate levels were youthful 15 years ago but have since declined, and despite numerous tests and interventions, they remain low relative to youthful norms. He aims to identify an individualized strategy to reverse this trend.
*   **Gut Microbiome (Advanced Analysis):** While some microbiome testing has been done, a more comprehensive approach would involve both 16S rRNA sequencing (identifying species present) and whole-genome sequencing or functional metagenomics (like Viome, for active gene expression) to understand both composition and activity. He prioritizes physiological changes reflected in blood biomarkers, suggesting that if gut microbiome interventions don't manifest in systemic blood markers, their immediate relevance might be lower for his current optimization strategy.
*   **Whole-Body MRI:** Mentions whole-body MRI as a potential future tracking method.

## Surprising Findings and Malleability of Biomarkers

A surprising finding was the malleability of lipoprotein(a), a biomarker traditionally considered genetically determined and resistant to change. Through meticulous tracking and dietary correlations, he identified a dietary composition that reduced his lipoprotein(a) levels by 50%. This illustrates his belief that all biomarkers are potentially modifiable through personalized interventions, even if achieving significant reductions in some markers might require balancing against potential negative impacts on other biomarkers.
