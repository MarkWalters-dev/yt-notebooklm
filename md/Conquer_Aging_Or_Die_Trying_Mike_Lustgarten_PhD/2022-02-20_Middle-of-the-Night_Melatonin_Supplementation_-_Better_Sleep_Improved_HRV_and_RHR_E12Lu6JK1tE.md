# 2022-02-20 Middle-of-the-Night Melatonin Supplementation - Better Sleep Improved HRV and RHR

## Executive Summary

*   Middle-of-the-night melatonin supplementation resulted in a statistically significant increase in average sleep duration by 30 minutes per day.
*   Melatonin supplementation was associated with a statistically significant increase in heart rate variability (HRV).
*   Melatonin supplementation was associated with a statistically significant decrease in resting heart rate (RHR).
*   After accounting for total sleep, physical activity, and calorie intake, middle-of-the-night melatonin intake remained significantly associated with higher HRV and lower RHR.

## Background: Melatonin and Circadian Rhythm

A healthy circadian rhythm involves the pineal gland producing melatonin to regulate the sleep-wake cycle. Disruptions to this rhythm, such as nighttime light exposure or aging, can lead to irregular melatonin levels, resulting in awakenings and poor sleep quality.

*   **Aging and Melatonin:** Blood melatonin levels are generally lower in older adults. Individuals over 70 have peak melatonin levels 5-6 times lower than children aged 5-10.
*   **Personal Observation:** The speaker experiences frequent awakenings between 2-5 AM, potentially linked to age-related decline in melatonin production.

## Study Design and Methodology

The study involved monitoring sleep duration, heart rate variability (HRV), and resting heart rate (RHR) over a 162-day period (September 2, 2021 - February 13, 2022). Data was compared between days with and without middle-of-the-night melatonin supplementation.

*   **Data Collection Period:** 162 days.
*   **No Melatonin Days:** 136 days.
*   **Melatonin Supplementation Days:** 26 days.
*   **Measurements:** Sleep duration, HRV, RHR, average daily heart rate (as an index of physical activity), and daily calorie intake.
*   **Statistical Analysis:** Two-sample t-tests and multivariate models were used to assess significance.

## Findings: Sleep Duration

Middle-of-the-night melatonin supplementation was associated with increased sleep duration.

*   **Average Sleep Duration (No Melatonin):** 7.2 hours.
*   **Average Sleep Duration (With Melatonin):** 7.7 hours.
*   **Result:** A statistically significant increase of 30 minutes per day in sleep duration on days with melatonin supplementation.

## Findings: Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

Melatonin supplementation was associated with improved HRV.

*   **Average HRV (No Melatonin):** 52 milliseconds.
*   **Average HRV (With Melatonin):** 54.2 milliseconds.
*   **Result:** A statistically significant increase in HRV on days with melatonin supplementation.

## Findings: Resting Heart Rate (RHR)

Melatonin supplementation was associated with a lower RHR.

*   **Average RHR (No Melatonin):** 46.7 beats per minute.
*   **Average RHR (With Melatonin):** 45.6 beats per minute.
*   **Result:** A statistically significant decrease in RHR on days with melatonin supplementation.
*   **Outlier Exclusion:** The significance of these findings was maintained even after removing two outlier data points corresponding to vaccine administration.

## Contextualizing HRV and RHR with Age

Higher HRV and lower RHR are generally characteristic of youth.

*   **HRV Decline with Age:** HRV (measured as RMSSD) decreases significantly from the 20s to the 60s.
*   **RHR Pattern with Age:** RHR tends to increase until the early 50s and then declines into older age.
*   **Melatonin's Impact:** The observed increases in HRV and decreases in RHR with melatonin supplementation suggest a trend towards a more youthful cardiovascular profile.

## Investigating Confounding Factors

To determine if melatonin was the direct cause of HRV and RHR improvements, other potential influencing factors were examined:

### Physical Activity

*   **Average Daily Heart Rate (No Melatonin):** 57.5 beats per minute.
*   **Average Daily Heart Rate (With Melatonin):** 57.3 beats per minute.
*   **Result:** No significant difference in average daily physical activity between days with and without melatonin supplementation.

### Calorie Intake

*   **Average Daily Calorie Intake (No Melatonin):** 2372 calories.
*   **Average Daily Calorie Intake (With Melatonin):** 2336 calories.
*   **Result:** A statistically significant decrease in calorie intake on days with melatonin supplementation.

## Multivariate Analysis

To isolate the effect of melatonin, multivariate models were used, controlling for total sleep, physical activity, and calorie intake.

### Association with Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

*   **Model:** Combination of total sleep, average daily heart rate, daily calorie intake, and melatonin associated with HRV.
*   **Overall Significance:** The combination of these factors was significantly associated with HRV.
*   **Melatonin's Specific Association:** After accounting for other factors, higher melatonin intake was significantly associated with *higher* HRV (positive coefficient, p < 0.05).

### Association with Resting Heart Rate (RHR)

*   **Model:** Combination of total sleep, average daily heart rate, daily calorie intake, and melatonin associated with RHR.
*   **Overall Significance:** The combination of these factors was significantly associated with RHR.
*   **Melatonin's Specific Association:** After accounting for other factors, higher melatonin intake was significantly associated with *lower* RHR (negative coefficient, p < 0.05).

## Conclusion

The data suggests that middle-of-the-night melatonin supplementation significantly improved sleep duration, HRV, and RHR. Crucially, even after controlling for sleep duration, physical activity, and calorie intake, melatonin intake remained a significant predictor of both improved HRV and lower RHR. Melatonin continues to be included in the speaker's supplement regimen.
