# 2024-04-24 Increased NAD With Clover Sprouts

## Executive Summary

*   Trigonelline (1-methylnicotinic acid), a form of niacin, has been shown to increase NAD levels in mice.
*   Clover seeds, particularly crimson or red clover seeds, are a significantly richer source of Trigonelline (five times higher) compared to alfalfa seeds.
*   An 8-day dietary intervention with 132 grams/day of alfalfa sprouts did not significantly increase intracellular NAD levels.
*   A subsequent 9-day dietary intervention with 120.5 grams/day of clover sprouts potentially resulted in a small (approximately 10%) increase in intracellular NAD levels, from a baseline maximum of 26.6 micromolar to 29.6 micromolar, exceeding typical levels observed without NAD precursors.
*   Low daily doses of nicotinic acid (20-45 mg/day) did not independently increase NAD levels to the same extent, supporting the potential effect of clover sprouts.

## Trigonelline Background

Trigonelline is 1-methylnicotinic acid, a form of niacin (nicotinic acid) with an attached methyl group. Research indicates that Trigonelline increases NAD levels in mice.

## Dietary Sources of Trigonelline

Clover seeds are identified as one of the richest sources of Trigonelline. Specifically, crimson or red clover seeds contain five times higher Trigonelline content per gram seed compared to alfalfa. Coffee is another high source, but was not the subject of this study.

## Alfalfa Sprout Experiment (Previous)

A previous experiment aimed to increase NAD by adding alfalfa sprouts to the diet.

### Protocol:
*   **Food:** Alfalfa sprouts
*   **Quantity:** 132 grams per day
*   **Duration:** 8 days

### Results:
This intervention did not result in a significant increase in NAD levels.

## Clover Sprout Experiment (Current)

Following the alfalfa sprout experiment, clover sprouts were introduced into the diet. It is assumed that the Trigonelline content in sprouts is similar to that in the seeds, though no specific published data supports this for sprouts.

### Protocol:
*   **Food:** Clover sprouts (alfalfa sprouts were removed)
*   **Quantity:** 120.5 grams per day
*   **Duration:** 9 days
*   **NAD Measurement:** Blood sample sent to GINFINITY for NAD analysis on April 1.

### Results:
*   The NAD level measured was 29.6 micromolar.
*   This represents a potential, albeit small, increase in NAD.

## NAD Test Results Analysis

A review of 17 NAD test results from January 2023 through April 2024 provides context for the recent finding.

### Baseline NAD Levels (Without Precursors):
*   Blood intracellular NAD levels have never exceeded 26.6 micromolar.
*   The typical range observed without NAD precursors is 18.5 to 26.6 micromolar over seven tests.

### NAD Levels with Precursors:
*   When NAD precursors were taken, NAD levels consistently exceeded 26 micromolar.
    *   1000 mg NMN: 39 micromolar NAD
    *   2000 mg NMN (with 12 mg B6): 61 micromolar NAD
        *   *Note on B6:* B6 is a required cofactor in the *de novo* NAD synthesis pathway, which converts tryptophan into NAD.
        *   **De Novo NAD Synthesis Pathway:** Tryptophan -> NAD (requires B6)
    *   Nicotinic acid (with or without tryptophan): 59 and 67 micromolar NAD
    *   Low dose nicotinic acid (60 mg/day): 38 micromolar NAD
    *   Nicotinic acid (26.8 micromolar after a 3-day break, with intake on the third day prior to testing).
*   One exception was low-dose NMN (300 mg/day), which resulted in 25.3 micromolar NAD, not showing a significant increase.

### Clover Sprout Effect:
*   The most recent test result of 29.6 micromolar NAD is outside the typical range (max 26.6 micromolar) observed without NAD precursors.
*   This suggests a small but potential increase in NAD attributable to the dietary addition of clover sprouts.
*   The average daily Trigonelline intake for the 9 days before the April 1 test was 138 mg, with 110 mg predominantly from clover sprouts.
*   In comparison, for a March 4 test where NAD was 26.3 micromolar, the average daily Trigonelline intake was 51 mg, with half from alfalfa sprouts.

## Potential Confounders: Nicotinic Acid

Low-dose nicotinic acid supplementation was ongoing during these periods, as it may offer benefits for exercise recovery (heart rate variability and resting heart rate).

### Nicotinic Acid Intake for March Test:
*   Average: 45 milligrams per day
*   Result: NAD was 26.3 micromolar, which did not move the needle. This suggests that for this individual, at least 60 mg/day of nicotinic acid alone might be necessary to increase NAD.

### Nicotinic Acid Intake for April Test (Clover Sprouts):
*   Average: 20 milligrams per day
*   Discontinuation: No nicotinic acid for four days before testing.
*   Conclusion: The very low dose and discontinuation prior to testing suggest that the 29.6 micromolar NAD level was primarily clover sprout-induced, representing approximately a 10% increase.

## Future Experiments

*   The next step is to double the clover sprout intake to 250 grams per day to determine if this further increases NAD. If NAD levels remain similar, it could suggest test-to-test variability rather than a clover sprout effect.
*   Beyond NAD, the effect on other biomarkers will be investigated to assess the overall net impact. This test is scheduled for April 29.
*   Blood will be sent for metabolomics to quantify plasma Trigonelline levels, allowing comparison with periods of lower dietary intake.
*   Epigenetic markers (Horvath and Dunedin Pace) will also be examined, as Trigonelline can act as a potential methyl donor. Data for these additional analyses are expected in May and early June.
