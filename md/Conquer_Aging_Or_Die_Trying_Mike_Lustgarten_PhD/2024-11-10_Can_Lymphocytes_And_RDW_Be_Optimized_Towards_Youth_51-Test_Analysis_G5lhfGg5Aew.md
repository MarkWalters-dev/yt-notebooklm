# 2024-11-10 Can Lymphocytes And RDW Be Optimized Towards Youth 51-Test Analysis

## Executive Summary

*   Higher lymphocyte levels in younger mice (16 weeks old) are correlated with increased lifespan, independent of diet or fasting.
*   Higher Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) in younger mice is correlated with a shorter lifespan, independent of diet or fasting.
*   Both lymphocytes and RDW exhibit age-related changes in mice: lymphocytes decline, while RDW increases. Resisting these changes correlates with increased lifespan.
*   Human data mirrors mouse findings, with RDW increasing with age and higher RDW associated with increased all-cause mortality. Lymphocyte levels also decline with age.
*   Personalized data analysis suggests a potential inverse correlation between calorie intake and RDW, and a positive correlation between calorie intake and lymphocyte levels, though increasing calories may negatively impact other biomarkers.

## Mouse Data

### Lifespan Extension Interventions

*   Fasting and calorie restriction (CR) were shown to extend median lifespan in mice.
*   **Intervention Groups:**
    *   Ad Libitum (AL) - unlimited food access.
    *   1 Day Fasting.
    *   2 Days Fasting.
    *   20% Calorie Restriction.
    *   40% Calorie Restriction.
*   **Findings:**
    *   Both fasting groups showed significant increases in median lifespan.
    *   20% CR showed a better lifespan extension than fasting.
    *   40% CR provided the greatest lifespan extension.
    *   Some mice in the Ad Libitum group also lived past 35 months, suggesting factors beyond specific dietary interventions can influence lifespan.

### Biomarker Correlation with Lifespan (Independent of Group)

Authors investigated biomarkers correlated with lifespan regardless of study group assignment (ad lib, fasting, or CR).

*   **Lymphocytes:** Relatively higher lymphocyte levels at 16 weeks of age were significantly correlated with a longer lifespan.
*   **Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW):** Relatively higher RDW levels at 16 weeks of age were significantly correlated with a shorter lifespan.

### Age-Related Biomarker Changes and Lifespan Correlation

The study observed that an individual's ability to resist age-related changes in lymphocytes and RDW at younger ages was significantly correlated with a longer lifespan.

*   **Lymphocyte Levels vs. Age:**
    *   Across all five groups, lymphocyte levels declined during aging.
    *   Mice that maintained higher lymphocyte levels, resisting this age-related decline, had significantly increased lifespans.
*   **RDW vs. Age:**
    *   Across all five groups, RDW levels increased during aging.
    *   Mice that resisted this age-related increase in RDW had significantly increased lifespans.

## Human Evidence

### RDW and Aging

*   RDW increases with age in humans, with a steeper increase observed in individuals over 85 years old.
*   Higher RDW in humans is significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality.

### Lymphocytes and Aging

*   Lymphocyte levels decline with age in humans, similar to observations in mice.
*   Average lymphocyte values in youth are approximately 2,100.
*   Higher lymphocyte levels are associated with a youthful phenotype and a reduced risk of all-cause mortality.

## Personal Analysis: 51 Tests Over Nine Years

The individual tracked their RDW and lymphocyte levels over nine years (51 tests) to assess their own biomarker trends and their correlation with chronological age. The goal is to optimize these biomarkers towards a youthful state to minimize all-cause mortality risk and potentially maximize lifespan.

### RDW Trend

*   **Finding:** A significant inverse correlation was observed between RDW and chronological age.
*   **Interpretation:** The individual has resisted or reversed the typical age-related increase in RDW.
*   **Future Question:** The focus is on whether this youthful RDW can be maintained indefinitely and its impact on health and lifespan.

### Lymphocyte Trend

*   **Finding:** No significant age-related decline in lymphocytes was observed over the nine-year period.
*   **Goal:** To maintain lymphocyte levels around 2,000 (youthful average) for as long as possible to potentially flatten mortality risk and enhance longevity.
*   **Future Question:** Whether it's possible to resist the age-related decline and approach the youthful average of 2,000.

## Approach to Biomarker Optimization

The individual employs a data-driven approach to optimize biomarkers, tracking diet and supplements meticulously.

### Data Tracking Methodology

1.  **Food Tracking:** Track all food intake using a food scale since 2015.
2.  **Dietary Input:** Enter daily food amounts into Cronometer (diet tracking app).
3.  **Data Export & Manual Input:** Export Cronometer data (macros, micronutrients, foods) into a spreadsheet.
4.  **Average Daily Intake Calculation:** For periods between blood tests, calculate the average dietary intake. This average intake is then correlated with the corresponding blood test results.
5.  **Supplement Tracking:** Similar tracking is applied to supplements.
6.  **Correlation Analysis:** Calculate correlations between diet, supplements, fitness metrics (heart rate variability, resting heart rate), sleep metrics, and biomarkers.

### Optimizing Lymphocytes: Calorie Intake Correlation

*   **Finding:** In the individual's data, calorie intake significantly correlated positively with lymphocyte levels.
*   **Observation:** Lower calorie intakes (around 2,100-2,150 calories) corresponded to lower lymphocyte levels, while higher intakes (around 2,800 calories) were associated with higher lymphocyte levels, potentially reaching the youthful average of 2,000.
*   **Current Strategy:** A small increase in calorie intake to approximately 2,150 calories has been implemented, with recent lymphocyte levels (1895 and 1877) showing improvement towards the youthful target.

### Potential Drawbacks of Increased Calorie Intake

*   **Multivariate Analysis:** A key principle is to improve one biomarker without negatively impacting others.
*   **Finding:** In the individual's data, higher calorie intake is significantly correlated with a decline in many other biomarkers associated with aging and increased mortality risk.
*   **Biomarkers Negatively Affected by Higher Calorie Intake (Red Arrows indicate going in the wrong direction):**
    *   **RDW (Correlation Coefficient: 0.71):** Higher calorie intake is strongly positively correlated with higher RDW.
    *   **Alkaline Phosphatase:** Positive correlation.
    *   **Aspartate Aminotransferase:** Positive correlation.
    *   **DHEA Sulfate:** Inverse correlation (higher calories, lower DHEA sulfate).
    *   **HDL:** Inverse correlation (higher calories, lower HDL).
    *   **HS-CRP:** Positive correlation (higher calories, higher inflammation).
    *   **Neutrophils + Monocytes:** Positive correlation (pro-inflammatory immune cells).
    *   **Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP):** Positive correlation.
    *   **Uric Acid:** Positive correlation.
*   **Biomarkers Potentially Positively Affected by Higher Calorie Intake (Green Arrow indicates going in the right direction):**
    *   **Platelets:** Platelets decline with age; higher calorie intake shows a positive correlation, potentially resisting this decline.
*   **Debatable Correlation:**
    *   **LDL:** The correlation is debated, as LDL levels follow a U-shaped curve with age.

### Current Strategy and Future Direction

*   **Calorie Intake Adjustment:** The individual is maintaining a calorie intake of approximately 2,150 calories. This represents a modest increase from the lowest intake (2,080 calories) but is significantly below the level associated with potential negative impacts on other biomarkers.
*   **Lymphocyte Improvement:** This moderate calorie increase has shown some positive impact on lymphocyte levels.
*   **Overall Goal:** To use this data-driven approach to find an optimal calorie intake that potentially improves lymphocytes and RDW, contributing to longevity, without detrimentally affecting other key biomarkers.
