# 2022-11-01 Dietary Fiber And SCFAs Are Relatively Higher in Centenarians-A Pathway To Longevity

## Executive Summary
*   Centenarians (average age 103) from a long-lived region in China exhibited significantly higher fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) compared to an elderly control group (average age 63).
*   Dietary fiber intake was significantly higher in centenarians. While protein and fat intake were similar, the elderly group consumed significantly more carbohydrates without a corresponding increase in fiber, suggesting potentially lower overall diet quality in the elderly.
*   Short chain fatty acids are primarily produced by the fermentation of soluble dietary fiber by gut microbiota.
*   Across the entire study cohort, higher dietary fiber intake was significantly correlated with increased levels of key SCFAs (acetate, propionate, butyrate, and valerate) and total SCFAs in fecal samples.
*   The data suggests a potential pathway where increased dietary fiber intake leads to higher SCFA production, which may contribute to centenarian status and longevity, though the current findings are correlational.

## Study Design
This study investigated centenarians from a long-lived region (LRC group) and compared them to an elderly group from the same region (LRE group).

*   **LRC Group (Centenarians):**
    *   Average age: 103 years
    *   Number of participants: 30
    *   Average BMI: 20
*   **LRE Group (Elderly):**
    *   Average age: 63 years
    *   Number of participants: 31
    *   Average BMI: 20.8

The total study cohort comprised 61 participants.

**Definition of a Long-Lived Region:**
*   The United Nations defines a long-lived region as having 7.5 centenarians per 100,000 people.
*   The study was conducted in Bama County, Guangxi province, China. This region boasts 43 centenarians per 100,000 people, which is 5-6 times greater than the UN definition.

## Fecal Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) in Centenarians
Fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured in both groups.
*   **SCFAs were significantly higher in centenarians** when compared with the 63-year-old elderly group.
*   The three primary SCFAs in terms of abundance—acetate (acetic acid), propionate (propionic acid), and butyrate (butyric acid)—were all significantly increased in centenarians.
*   Other SCFAs, including isobutyrate (isobutyric acid) and valerate (valeric acid), also showed significant increases in centenarians.
*   Consequently, **total SCFA levels in fecal samples were higher in centenarians** compared to the elderly group.

## SCFA Production
Short chain fatty acids are produced through the fermentation of soluble dietary fiber by gut bacteria. Insoluble fiber is not fermented to produce SCFAs.

Soluble Dietary Fiber -> Gut Microbiota -> Acetate, Propionate, Butyrate (primary SCFAs)

## Dietary Fiber Intake and Macronutrient Comparison
Dietary intake was assessed for both groups:

*   **Dietary Fiber Intake:** Centenarians had a significantly higher dietary fiber intake compared to the 63-year-old elderly group.
*   **Carbohydrate Intake:** The 63-year-old elderly group had a significantly increased carbohydrate intake compared to centenarians.
*   **Protein and Fat Intake:** Levels of protein and fat intake were not significantly different between centenarians and the elderly group.

The finding that the elderly consumed more carbohydrates but less fiber suggests their overall diet quality may be lower compared to centenarians. High carbohydrate intake, especially from fruits and vegetables, should typically correlate with higher dietary fiber intake.

## Correlation Between Dietary Fiber Intake and Fecal SCFAs
When analyzing the total study cohort of 61 individuals, dietary fiber intake was significantly correlated with fecal SCFA levels.
*   **Correlation Coefficient (r):** Measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship.
*   **P-value (p):** Indicates statistical significance; p < 0.05 typically denotes a significant correlation.

Relatively higher dietary fiber intakes were significantly correlated with:
*   Acetate
*   Propionate
*   Butyrate
*   Valerate
*   Total short chain fatty acids

This indicates that higher dietary fiber intake corresponded to higher levels of these specific SCFAs and the total amount of SCFAs in stool.

## Proposed Longevity Pathway
Based on the correlational data, a hypothesis emerges:
Increased Dietary Fiber Intake -> Increased Fecal Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) -> Potential Pathway to Centenarian Status/Longevity

While this study demonstrates strong correlations, it suggests a potential causative pathway involved in human longevity that warrants further investigation.
