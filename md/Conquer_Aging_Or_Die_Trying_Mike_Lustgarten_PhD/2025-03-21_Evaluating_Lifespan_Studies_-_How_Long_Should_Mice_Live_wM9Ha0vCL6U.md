# 2025-03-21 Evaluating Lifespan Studies - How Long Should Mice Live

### Executive Summary
*   The '900-day rule' suggests C57BL/6 and HET3 mice should live around 900 days under optimal conditions.
*   Achieving this 900-day lifespan for control mice enhances the robustness of study results.
*   Interventions resulting in lifespans significantly exceeding 950 days strongly indicate efficacy, even if control groups show shorter lifespans.
*   Mouse lifespans can be highly consistent within specific research facilities and labs, despite overall variability challenges.

## Mouse Lifespan Benchmarks

Under optimal circumstances, C57BL/6 and HET3 mice should live approximately 900 days, a guideline referred to as the '900-day rule'. Data consistently shows that in the best-case scenarios, these mice reach this lifespan. Achieving this lifespan for control mice in a study indicates greater robustness of the research results.

## Study Robustness and Consistency

Even if control mice are short-lived, an intervention leading to a lifespan significantly higher than 950 days suggests a robust and beneficial effect. Such outcomes are considered extremely unusual and are often compared against historical control data to confirm their significance.

While the 900-day benchmark might seem stringent, data from various colleagues, including Alan Richardson's group, Marco Malavolta in Italy, and the Interventions Testing Program (ITP) for female HET3 mice, demonstrates that consistent, high lifespans are achievable. This highlights that mouse lifespans can be very consistent within specific research facilities and labs, despite the inherent challenges in fully controlling mouse lifespans.
