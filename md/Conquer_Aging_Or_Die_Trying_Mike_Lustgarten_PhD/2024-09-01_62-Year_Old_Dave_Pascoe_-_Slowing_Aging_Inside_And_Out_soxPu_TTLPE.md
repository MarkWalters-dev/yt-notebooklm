**Executive Summary**

*   **Stress Management & Telomere Health:** Chronic stress from high-intensity exercise, demanding jobs, and caregiving significantly shortens telomeres. Implementing stress mitigation techniques like yoga, meditation, and structured recovery protocols (e.g., sauna, compression boots, AmpCoil, BrainTap) is crucial for telomere lengthening and overall physiological resilience.
*   **Diet's Epigenetic Impact:** A shift to a 100% clean, unprocessed diet profoundly improved epigenetic aging pace (DunedinPACE from 0.77 to 0.66), highlighting the direct influence of nutritional quality on biological age.
*   **Optimized Exercise for Functional Fitness:** A regimen combining varied intensity training like P90X and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on a CAROL bike significantly enhances cardiovascular health and functional performance, demonstrating remarkable improvements in endurance and strength regardless of chronological age.
*   **Advanced Regenerative Interventions:** Exploration of cutting-edge therapies such as Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment (HBOT), cord-derived exosomes, placenta-derived stem cells, and regular plasma donation is used for systemic rejuvenation and targeted repair of brain injuries and overuse musculoskeletal issues.
*   **Personalized Supplement & Lifestyle Optimization:** Detailed self-experimentation and micronutrient analysis revealed specific deficiencies (e.g., B vitamin deficiency caused by tea polyphenols) and sensitivities (e.g., high-dose supplements causing diarrhea), emphasizing the need for individualized adjustments to optimize energy and health.

## Early Life & Influences

Dave Pascoe developed an early interest in health and fitness, inspired by the movie *Rocky* at age 13-14. This led to initial self-directed workouts, focusing on muscle development. Despite parental discouragement from high school sports, he independently pursued fitness.

His interest in computers began in 1977 with Fortran '77 using punch cards. This early exposure to programming led to curiosity-driven exploration. In high school, he discovered and exploited a vulnerability in his county's mainframe system, gaining command-line access. His motivation was curiosity rather than malice, demonstrated by fixing a bug in a Star Wars game. This experience cultivated a data-driven, problem-solving mindset.

## Career & Data-Driven Mindset

After double-majoring in Computer Science and Psychology, Pascoe's first job involved direct mail marketing. Frustrated by inefficiencies, he began automating systems. He developed a program named "Donald Hollinger" that simulated manual keyboard tasks for batch operations, reducing dispatch processing time from a week to a day, then to hours, and eventually to about 1.5 hours. This demonstrated his ability to reverse-engineer and optimize complex systems, a skill he later applied to his own health. He worked at this company for about ten years, establishing a reputation for efficiency.

## Longevity Journey & Early Insights

Around 2012, at age 50, Pascoe embarked on his first marathon and learned about telomeres. Despite feeling fitter at 50 than at 30 (attributed to P90X training), his initial telomere test indicated a biological age of 68 years.

A consultation revealed key factors contributing to his accelerated telomere shortening:
*   **High Chronic Stress:** From a demanding, high-stress job and caregiving for two elderly parents battling cancer.
*   **Physical Stress from Exercise:** P90X and marathon training were interpreted as excessive physiological stress.

This led to a re-emphasis on stress mitigation and recovery.

## Exercise Philosophy & Regimen

Pascoe integrates varied exercise types, prioritizing recovery and synergy between activities. He views exercise as a hormetic stressor, with the ability to recover quickly being key.

**P90X Training Protocol:**
*   Utilizes a 14-day cycle with different workouts (weight-bearing, cardio like extreme yoga, Pilates, Kempo X, plyometrics) from DVDs.
*   Follows a personalized Excel-based schedule for daily workout selection.
*   Includes recovery days, often active recovery with low-impact movements.
*   Found that sticking through the initial two weeks of soreness led to significant gains.

**CAROL Bike Protocol (High-Intensity Interval Training - HIIT):**
*   Uses the "two 20-second all-out sprints" program.
*   Warm-up: Approximately 2 minutes, following a breath pacer, maintaining power output under 20 watts.
*   Sprint 1: 20 seconds of all-out effort, with progressively increasing resistance.
*   Recovery: 2 minutes of low-intensity pedaling to bring heart rate down.
*   Sprint 2: 20 seconds of all-out effort.
*   Cool-down.
*   Total workout duration: Less than 10 minutes.
*   AI-driven resistance ensures continuous challenge and progressive improvement.
*   Observed significant cardiovascular improvement (e.g., faster stadium climb and six-mile run times without specific training).

He balances structured workouts with other activities like yard work, sometimes skipping workouts for intense physical labor to avoid overtraining. Despite subjective feelings of fatigue, he often finds that scheduled runs during these times result in his best performances.

## Stress Management & Recovery

Pascoe actively manages stress, especially after high-intensity activities.

**Recovery Modalities:**
*   **Sauna:** Utilized post-exercise for synergistic benefits, maintaining high growth hormone, and promoting relaxation through meditation or entertainment.
*   **NormaTec Compression Boots:** For improved circulation and muscle recovery.
*   **AmpCoil:** Used with specific detox and recovery protocols.
*   **BrainTap:** For mental relaxation and brain optimization.

This layered approach helps his body return to a relaxed state quickly after demanding efforts.

## Diet & Epigenetic Aging

Pascoe's dietary shift had a profound impact on his biological age. Initially, despite general fitness, he consumed processed foods. After his parents passed away and home renovations were complete, he transitioned to preparing all his own meals, focusing on 100% clean eating, primarily fruits and vegetables, with minimal processed items. This change correlated directly with a significant improvement in his TrueDiagnostic epigenetic aging pace, from 0.77 to 0.66. He does not count calories but prioritizes food quality.

## Advanced Interventions & Weak Spots

Pascoe proactively addresses age-related wear and tear and injuries using advanced interventions.

*   **Plasma Donation:** Donates plasma regularly (every 4.5-5 donations replaces total plasma volume) as a "changing the oil in your car" strategy to remove degraded proteins and metabolic waste. He notes no subjective or biomarker changes from this practice.
*   **Concussion Recovery:** Following a roller coaster-induced concussion in 2021, which severely impacted his balance, he implemented a brain healing protocol.
    *   **Brain Healing Protocol:**
        *   Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment (HBOT).
        *   Cerebolysin peptide.
        *   CMAX/C Link peptides (as per Amen Clinic protocols).
        *   Balance exercises (e.g., Slackline, Gibbons board).
*   **Overuse Injury Management:** Deals with rotator cuff impingement, an elbow injury that prevents full straightening, and knee discomfort.
    *   **Exosomes:** Received cord-derived exosome treatment for his shoulder, experiencing immediate pain relief. However, premature intense activity (gymnastic rings) led to re-injury.
    *   **Stem Cells:** Plans to receive placenta-derived stem cell treatments, locally injected into injured joints and systemically. This will be combined with HBOT, ozone therapy, and specific peptides, followed by a disciplined recovery and rehabilitation period to avoid re-injury. He aims for a 3-month cycle for potential repeat dosing.

## Supplement Optimization & Personal Discoveries

Pascoe's supplement approach is data-driven and responsive to his body's feedback.

*   **Nicotinamide Riboside (NR):** At age 54, a 300mg dose of NR provided a significant, subjective energy boost, allowing him to complete P90X workouts efficiently.
*   **NAD Levels:** Recent measurements showed his NAD levels to be at the "low end of optimal," suggesting that NR alone might not fully optimize it or that other factors are at play.
*   **B Vitamin Deficiency:** A SpectraCell micronutrient analysis revealed a B vitamin deficiency. He traced this to consuming a very strong brew of mixed teas (Oolong, green, black), where polyphenols were blocking B vitamin absorption. Removing the tea from his routine normalized his B vitamin levels and restored energy. This had previously also affected his ferritin levels.
*   **Dose Titration:** Increasing doses of Glucosamine and Taurine based on study recommendations led to chronic diarrhea, indicating exceeding his bowel tolerance. He subsequently reduced these doses, resolving the issue.
*   **Hair & Appearance:** Actively dyes his hair and beard to maintain a youthful appearance. Also uses Xeomin (a neuromodulator similar to Botox) for forehead wrinkles, administered approximately every 8 weeks due to high activity and fast metabolism.

## Home & Technology Integration

Pascoe has created a "smart house" environment to support his health and daily routines.

**Smart Home Features:**
*   **Automated Lighting & Blinds:** Phillips Hue bulbs in recessed lights and Levolor power blinds are controlled by a Samsung SmartThings hub. Lights automatically shift to red at sunset and progressively dim, also simulating presence when he's away.
*   **Voice Control:** Amazon Echo Dot devices in every room allow voice commands for lighting, blinds, and other integrated systems.
*   **Networked Faucets:** Touch-activated, network-enabled Delta faucets can be commanded to fill precise volumes, aiding in tasks like filling water pitchers.
*   **Synchronized Media:** Smart TVs in every room, powered by Google Chrome devices, display synchronized content (e.g., podcasts, YouTube videos), allowing him to move freely while staying engaged.
*   **Automated Routines:** Voice commands trigger "Good night" (turns off all lights) and "Good morning" (provides date, weather, calendar, news updates).

**Integrated Biohacking Tools (Morning Routine):**
*   **PEMF (Beamer):** Used in bed to support blood flow and circulation.
*   **NanoVi:** Inhales vapors via cannula to aid in protein misfolding and oxidative stress.
*   These tools are stacked and used concurrently during his morning routine.

He maintains a robust hardware firewall for network security, acknowledging the potential for hacking in a smart home environment.

## Future Plans & Mindset

Pascoe plans to undergo a SPECT (Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan at Daniel Amen's clinic to assess functional brain health and any lingering effects from his concussion. He is also curious about the potential benefits of psychedelics (Ayahuasca, Psilocybin) for expanding consciousness and perception, though access is currently limited.

His core philosophy is to strive for optimal health and physical capability "not good for my age, but good for any age." He prioritizes quality time and relationships over rigid adherence to routines, viewing life experiences as more valuable than missed meals or workouts. He noted an interesting observation of chest hair returning to a 50/50 black/white ratio, wondering if a specific intervention is responsible.
