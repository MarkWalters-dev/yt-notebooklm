# 2024-10-30 Home Water Filter Use Is Associated With Less Lead In Blood

## Executive Summary

*   Plasma lead levels less than 0.8 micrograms per deciliter are associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality.
*   Plasma lead levels below 1 microgram per deciliter were observed in the presenter, which is below the upper limit of the reference range (less than 3.5 micrograms per deciliter).
*   Individuals reporting the use of household water treatment devices (e.g., pitcher filters, reverse osmosis) showed significantly lower levels of lead in their blood.
*   This association suggests that home water filtration may be a contributing factor to maintaining lower plasma lead levels.
*   Cocoa beans are a potential source of dietary lead, with an estimated intake of approximately 40 micrograms per day based on a 20-gram daily consumption.

## Personal Lead Data and Optimal Levels

*   **Presenter's Plasma Lead Level:** Less than 1 microgram per deciliter (below the lowest limit of detection) as of a September 6th test.
*   **Optimal Lead Level for Mortality Risk:** Plasma lead levels less than 0.8 micrograms per deciliter are associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality.
*   **Reference Range:** The upper limit of the typical reference range for plasma lead is less than 3.5 micrograms per deciliter.
*   **Mortality Risk at Reference Upper Limit:** Individuals with plasma lead levels of 3.5 micrograms per deciliter have a 30% increased risk of all-cause mortality compared to those with 0.8 micrograms per deciliter.

## Factors Associated with Lower Lead Levels

### Household Water Treatment Device (HWTD) Usage

*   **Association:** The use of household water treatment devices is associated with reduced levels of lead in blood.
*   **Types of HWTDs:**
    *   Water pitcher filters (e.g., Brita)
    *   Ceramic or charcoal filters
    *   Water softeners or aerators
    *   Reverse osmosis systems
*   **Findings:** Across various demographic groups (all people, men, women, individuals older than 60, and individuals younger than 60), those who reported using HWTDs consistently had significantly lower plasma lead levels.

### Personal Water Filter Usage

*   **Presenter's Filter:** Clearly Filtered water pitcher, which claims to remove up to 99.3% of lead.
*   **Caveat:** This is an association, not necessarily causation, and the presenter acknowledges this may be one factor among others.

## Potential Dietary Sources of Lead

*   **Cocoa Beans:** Identified as a notorious source of relatively high lead levels.
*   **Lead Content in Cocoa:** Approximately 2 micrograms of lead per gram of cocoa bean.
*   **Estimated Dietary Increase:** A daily intake of 20 grams of cocoa beans is estimated to increase daily dietary lead intake by approximately 40 micrograms.
*   **Future Testing:** The impact of this increased dietary lead intake on plasma levels will be assessed in a December blood test.
