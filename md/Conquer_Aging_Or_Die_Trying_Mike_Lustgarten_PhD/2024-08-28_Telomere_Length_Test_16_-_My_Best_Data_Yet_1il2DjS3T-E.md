# 2024-08-28 Telomere Length Test 16 - My Best Data Yet

**Executive Summary:**

*   Telomere length, a key hallmark of aging, naturally declines with age, falling from an average of 7.75 kilobases in youth to around 5 kilobases in centenarians.
*   Personal telomere length data (estimated via DNA methylation) showed an increase in average length from 7.05 kilobases (2022) to 7.13 kilobases (2023). The most recent test (2024) recorded the longest length yet at 7.24 kilobases.
*   A correlation analysis of 98 dietary variables across 16 tests identified significant associations with telomere length. Cloves showed a statistically significant positive correlation, while saturated fatty acids (from sources like coconut butter and cacao beans) and potassium were inversely correlated.
*   The strategy for the next test involves increasing clove intake and decreasing saturated fatty acid intake to attempt to replicate and improve the 7.24 kilobase reading.

## Understanding Telomere Length and Aging

Telomere shortening is a fundamental hallmark of aging, negatively impacting other aging hallmarks such as genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, and stem cell exhaustion. Telomere length consistently declines with age in both men and women. For instance, average leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is approximately 7.75 kilobases in youth but drops to around 5 kilobases in centenarians.

## Personal Telomere Length Data

Telomere length data is estimated using a DNA methylation-based method, which may offer a better measure for all-cause mortality risk compared to standard telomere length measurements.

*   **2022 Data:** Over three tests, the average telomere length was 7.05 kilobases. This value was considered close to age-expected and significantly lower than the youthful average of 7.75 kilobases.
*   **2023 Data:** Based on eight tests, the average telomere length improved to 7.13 kilobases, moving closer to youthful values.
*   **2024 Data:** The most recent test achieved a best-ever telomere length of 7.24 kilobases. This represents a low-probability event given the general age-related decline. However, the overall 2024 average remains at 7.13 kilobases, identical to 2023, because three of the last six tests were on the lower side of the measurement range.

This variability prompts questions: Can the 7.24 kilobase value be repeated, and what factors contributed to this significant jump from earlier measurements?

## Methodology for Correlation Analysis

To identify factors correlated with telomere length and other biomarkers, a structured data collection and analysis protocol is followed:

*   Since 2015, all food intake is weighed using a food scale and recorded daily in Cronometer.
*   Cronometer data is exported into a spreadsheet for analysis.
*   Each blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake calculated for the period between the previous and current blood test. For example, if 50 days pass between blood tests, the average dietary intake for those 50 days is associated with the latter blood test.
*   With sufficient blood test data and tracked dietary, supplement, or fitness variables, correlations between inputs and biomarkers can be calculated.
*   After every test, correlations are calculated for various dietary and other variables against biomarkers, including telomere length.

For the current analysis (16 tests), 98 comparisons were made for telomere length with foods, macro, and micronutrients. Nine variables showed statistical significance with a p-value less than 0.02, and a total of 19 variables had a p-value less than 0.05.

## Significant Correlations with Telomere Length

A summary of statistically significant correlations (p-value < 0.02) from 16 tests:

*   **Cloves:** Positively correlated (r = 0.076) with a longer epigenetic estimation of telomere length. Average intake during high periods was at most 0.4 grams per day. Higher intake of cloves correlated with longer telomere length.
*   **Saturated Fatty Acids (SFAs):** Inversely correlated with telomere length. Higher SFA intake correlated with shorter telomere length.
    *   **Coconut Butter:** Inversely correlated with telomere length, contributing significantly to SFA intake.
    *   **Cacao Beans:** Inversely correlated with telomere length, also a major contributor to SFA and copper intake.
*   **Copper:** May play a role in the observed correlations, primarily sourced from cacao beans and mushrooms (though mushrooms did not meet the p-value threshold for this list).
*   **Potassium:** Inversely correlated with telomere length. While average intake can be as high as 10,000 milligrams per day, the data suggest an optimal intake around 6,500 milligrams per day based on correlations with telomere length.
*   **Selenium:** Positively correlated with telomere length. Increased intake was part of a separate experiment but showed a beneficial correlation here.
*   **Sardines:** Positively correlated with telomere length. Increased intake was part of an experiment to test overall biomarker impact.
*   **Calcium:** Positively correlated with telomere length. Increased intake was also part of an experimental strategy.

## Future Strategy for Telomere Optimization

The goal is to optimize telomere length by adjusting intake based on observed correlations, focusing on as many significant correlations as possible.

**Strategy for Test #17:**

*   **Cloves:** Intake will be kept relatively high (e.g., 0.4 grams per day).
*   **Saturated Fatty Acids:** Intake will be on the lower end, with cacao beans and coconut butter specifically limited.
*   **Selenium, Sardines, and Calcium:** Intake will *not* be purposely increased for this test to isolate the effects of cloves and SFAs.

**Anticipated Outcomes and Future Adjustments:**

*   If telomere length is not 7.24 kilobases but is higher than the 7.13 kilobases average, it would suggest cloves and saturated fatty acids are key mechanisms impacting telomere length.
*   If telomere length is around 7.17 kilobases (still on the high side of the data), it may indicate that higher intake of selenium, sardines, and calcium could be necessary to reach or exceed 7.24 kilobases.
*   Correlations are recalculated after each test, and the strategy is continually refined to follow the most impactful inputs for biomarker optimization.
