# 2022-10-16 The Cholesterol-DHEA-S Experiment A Role For Thyroid Function on DHEA-S And Or Homocysteine

### Executive Summary

*   The speaker's DHEA-S level (129 micrograms/dL) is low for his chronological age and past historical data, aligning with study findings that link DHEA-S levels below 129 micrograms/dL to an increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   An experiment to raise DHEA-S by increasing dietary cholesterol (from 22 mg/day to 212 mg/day) did not succeed. The intervention did not increase blood total cholesterol, and DHEA-S levels showed no significant change, even trending slightly lower.
*   Research consistently demonstrates that individuals with hypothyroidism have significantly lower DHEA-S levels compared to healthy controls, with Free T3 (fT3) levels showing a significant positive correlation with DHEA-S.
*   The speaker's recent blood test reveals low Free T3 levels, suggesting that suboptimal thyroid function may be a root cause for his low DHEA-S.
*   Clinical studies indicate that thyroid hormone treatment in hypothyroid patients effectively reduces elevated homocysteine levels, implying that adjusting the speaker's Free T3 could also address his higher-than-expected homocysteine (12 micromolar).

## DHEA-S Levels and All-Cause Mortality Risk

The speaker's DHEA sulfate level was 129 micrograms per deciliter (3.5 micromolar) on August 22. While this level might fall within a broad reference range, DHEA sulfate naturally declines with age. Comparing the current 129 micrograms per deciliter to two data points from the speaker's early thirties reveals an age-related decline, with current levels being lower than historical values.

Data from a 27-year follow-up study involving approximately 400 subjects (average age close to the speaker's chronological age) demonstrated a significant relationship between DHEA sulfate and all-cause mortality (ACM) risk. Individuals with DHEA sulfate levels less than 129 micrograms per deciliter had a significantly increased ACM risk compared to those with levels greater than 200 micrograms per deciliter. Based on these findings, the speaker's current DHEA sulfate level of 129 micrograms per deciliter indicates an increased all-cause mortality risk.

## Investigating DHEA-S Production and Cholesterol

DHEA sulfate is produced through a metabolic pathway starting from cholesterol:

**Cholesterol -> Pregnenolone -> 17-hydroxypregnenolone -> DHEA -> DHEA sulfate**

The initial hypothesis was that increasing blood cholesterol levels, as a precursor, would lead to increased DHEA sulfate levels. While published studies often state that dietary cholesterol does not impact blood cholesterol levels, the speaker's personal data, tracking diet and blood biomarkers since 2015, showed a significant correlation between dietary cholesterol intake and blood cholesterol levels across 39 blood tests. Higher dietary cholesterol intake corresponded to higher blood cholesterol levels in his data.

## Experiment: Dietary Cholesterol and DHEA-S

To test the hypothesis that increasing dietary cholesterol would raise blood cholesterol and subsequently DHEA-S, an experiment was conducted using at-home blood testing.

### Protocol:

*   **Baseline Phase (12 tests):** Average daily dietary cholesterol intake was 22 milligrams per day. Average DHEA sulfate was 119 micrograms per deciliter.
*   **Intervention Phase (4 tests):** Dietary cholesterol was increased to approximately 212 milligrams per day by adding eggs. DHEA sulfate was measured the day after egg intake for each of these tests. Average DHEA sulfate was 105 micrograms per deciliter.

### Results:

A statistical comparison of DHEA sulfate levels between the two groups showed no significant difference (p > 0.05). In fact, there was a non-significant trend towards lower DHEA sulfate with increased dietary cholesterol. Crucially, blood total cholesterol levels also did not change significantly between the two groups (106 milligrams per deciliter for both, p = 0.46).

The hypothesis was not supported: increased dietary cholesterol did not affect blood cholesterol levels, and consequently, there was no effect on DHEA sulfate. Furthermore, total cholesterol was not significantly correlated with DHEA sulfate over the 16 tests, arguing against this strategy for increasing DHEA-S.

## Thyroid Function and DHEA-S

Instead of direct supplementation, the focus shifted to identifying and addressing potential root causes for low DHEA-S. The speaker was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in his twenties and takes Levothyroxine (T4) at 137.5 micrograms per day.

### Evidence for Thyroid-DHEA-S Link:

*   **Study 1:** Hypothyroid patients (average age 37 years) had significantly decreased DHEA sulfate levels (2.57 micrograms/mL) compared to healthy controls (3.38 micrograms/mL).
*   **Study 2:** In a separate study with hypothyroid patients closer to the speaker's chronological age (around 50), DHEA sulfate levels were again significantly lower compared to healthy controls.
*   **Mechanism:** Serum levels of DHEA sulfate were significantly correlated with Free T3 (fT3). Higher levels of fT3 were associated with relatively higher DHEA sulfate.

### Speaker's Thyroid Data (October 3):

*   **Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) and Free T4 (fT4):** Both values were within the reference range.
*   **Free T3 (fT3):** Levels were low, particularly relative to the reference range, indicating suboptimal Free T3 status.

Given the strong association between Free T3 and DHEA sulfate, the current goal is to increase Free T3 levels, which may in turn raise DHEA sulfate. This requires consultation with a doctor and potentially an endocrinologist to adjust the thyroid medication dose.

## Thyroid Function and Homocysteine

Interestingly, adjusting thyroid hormone levels to raise Free T3 may also impact homocysteine, which was measured at 12 micromolar in the speaker's most recent test—a level higher than expected for his chronological age.

### Evidence for Thyroid-Homocysteine Link:

*   **Observational Study:** Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (elevated TSH but normal T4) had significantly higher homocysteine levels compared to healthy controls.
*   **Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT):** This study investigated the effect of thyroid hormone treatment on homocysteine in hypothyroid patients.
    *   ### Protocol:
        *   Patients with severe hypothyroidism (TSH > 25) had plasma homocysteine measured.
        *   They were then treated with Levothyroxine (T4) for 3 to 9 months to restore euthyroid (normal thyroid) status.
        *   Plasma homocysteine was measured again after treatment.
    *   ### Results:
        *   When hypothyroid, average plasma homocysteine was 14.1 micromolar.
        *   After restoration of thyroid status (euthyroid), average plasma homocysteine significantly declined to 8.2 micromolar, representing a 44% reduction.

### Conclusion and Next Steps

The next step is to address the speaker's relatively low Free T3 levels. Adjusting the thyroid dose with a physician's guidance could potentially lead to an increase in DHEA sulfate and a decrease in homocysteine, addressing two identified biomarkers of concern.
