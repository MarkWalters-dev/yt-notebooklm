# 2025-02-18 How Good Or Not Is The Biological Age Calculator PhenoAge

### Executive Summary
*   PhenoAge demonstrates a very strong correlation with chronological age (correlation coefficients of 0.96 and 0.94 in two large NHANES studies), comparable to leading epigenetic clocks.
*   An older PhenoAge relative to chronological age is significantly associated with a 9% increased risk for all-cause mortality for every one-year increment.
*   PhenoAge is also associated with increased risk for cause-specific mortality, including cardiovascular disease (10%), cancer (7%), diabetes (20%), and chronic lower respiratory diseases (9%) per one-year increase.
*   A weak spot for PhenoAge is its non-significant association with Alzheimer's related mortality.
*   For optimal health tracking, it's recommended to include PhenoAge assessment alongside other biomarkers specific to Alzheimer's disease, such as blood pressure and the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio.

## PhenoAge and Chronological Age Correlation

Phenotypic age (PhenoAge), a biological age calculator, exhibits a strong correlation with chronological age.

*   **NHANES IV Study:** Data from over 11,000 people showed a strong correlation coefficient of 0.96 for PhenoAge with chronological age, with a p-value of 1 x 10^-200.
*   **NHANES III Study:** Findings were reproduced in a second study with over 9,900 people, showing a correlation coefficient of 0.94.
*   A strong correlation is defined as anything greater than 0.7. The 0.94-0.96 range is comparable to the best epigenetic clocks (e.g., Horvath clock) in predicting chronological age.

## PhenoAge and Mortality Risk

While a strong correlation with chronological age is important, the utility of a biological age clock is further demonstrated by its association with health-related outcomes, specifically mortality risk.

### All-Cause Mortality

Having an older PhenoAge relative to chronological age is significantly associated with an increased risk of death for all causes. Specifically, a one-year older PhenoAge is associated with a 9% increased risk for all-cause mortality.

### Cause-Specific Mortality

PhenoAge is also associated with increased risk for specific causes of death:

*   **Cardiovascular Disease (CVD):** A one-year older PhenoAge is significantly associated with a 10% increased risk of death from CVD.
*   **Cancer:** A one-year older PhenoAge is associated with a 7% increased risk of death from cancer.
*   **Diabetes:** A one-year older PhenoAge is associated with a 20% increased risk for diabetes-related mortality.
*   **Chronic Lower Respiratory Diseases:** A one-year older PhenoAge is associated with a 9% increased risk of death from chronic lower respiratory diseases.

### Limitations and Additional Biomarkers

*   **Alzheimer's Related Mortality:** PhenoAge's association with Alzheimer's related mortality was not statistically significant, indicating a potential weak spot.
*   For a comprehensive assessment aimed at slowing aging and maximizing health and lifespan, it is recommended to track PhenoAge alongside other biomarkers potentially specific to Alzheimer's disease, such as blood pressure and the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio.
