# 2025-04-10 Which Biomarkers Are Associated With Cancer Cachexia

## Executive Summary

*   Body weight in both mice and humans follows an inverse U-shaped trajectory during aging, increasing until midlife and then declining.
*   Cancer is a major cause of death in mice post-midlife, and the accompanying muscle and fat wasting is known as cancer cachexia.
*   This inverse U-shaped body weight pattern and cancer incidence increase with age suggest cancer cachexia may contribute to age-related weight loss in humans.
*   Biomarkers correlated with cachexia stage scoring in stage four cancer patients include albumin, hemoglobin, lymphocytes, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF alpha, IL-6, IL-8, CRP), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and the Systemic Immune Inflammatory Index (SII).
*   Maintaining youthful levels of albumin, hemoglobin, and lymphocytes may be important for delaying cancer cachexia progression.

## Aging and Body Weight Trends

### Mouse Data

*   Body weight in mice increases until midlife (approximately 20 months of age).
*   Different dietary interventions (ad libitum, 1-day fasting, 2-day fasting, 20% caloric restriction (CR), 40% CR) were applied starting at six months of age.
*   All groups, including 40% CR initially, showed an increase in body weight up to midlife.
*   After midlife, body weight declines across all groups, suggesting an age-related decline.
*   Cancer is identified as the major cause of death in mice post-midlife.

### Human Evidence (BMI)

*   Body Mass Index (BMI) in humans, similar to mice, increases until midlife and then declines.
*   This trend is observed across different ethnicities and genders.
*   The decline in BMI after midlife, coupled with increasing cancer incidence with age, suggests a potential link to cancer cachexia.

## Cancer Cachexia Phenotype

*   Tumors secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF alpha, IL-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP).
*   These cytokines can lead to:
    *   **Anorexia:** Decreased drive to eat, contributing to weight loss.
    *   **Fat Wasting:** Loss of fat mass.
    *   **Skeletal Muscle Atrophy:** Loss of muscle mass.
    *   **Cardiac Atrophy:** Shrinkage of heart muscle.
    *   **Organ Dysfunction:** Negative impact on pancreatic and gut function.
*   Collectively, these effects constitute the cancer cachexia phenotype.

### Stages of Cancer Cachexia

*   **Pre-cachexia:** Characterized by unintended weight loss of less than 10% of total body weight after a cancer diagnosis.
*   **Cachexia:** Defined as weight loss greater than 10% of total body weight.
*   **Refractory Cachexia:** Characterized by severe wasting and is the stage closest to death.
*   Anorexia is a common characteristic across all stages.

## Biomarkers Associated With Cachexia Stage

The following biomarkers are correlated with cachexia stage scoring in stage four cancer patients:

### Biomarkers Generally Lower in Cachexia

*   **Albumin:** Levels are relatively high in youth and decline with aging. Lower levels are more likely in refractory cachexia.
*   **Hemoglobin (Hb):** Levels are relatively high in youth and decline with aging. Lower levels are more likely in refractory cachexia.
*   **Lymphocytes:** Relatively high levels are found in youth and decline with aging. Lower levels are more likely in refractory cachexia.

### Biomarkers Generally Higher in Cachexia

*   **Pro-inflammatory Cytokines:**
    *   TNF alpha
    *   IL-6
    *   IL-8
    *   C-reactive protein (CRP)
    Relatively higher levels are found in refractory cachexia compared to pre-cachexia.

### Immune Cell Ratios

*   **Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR):** Higher ratios are more likely in refractory cachexia.
*   **Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR):** Higher ratios are more likely in refractory cachexia.

### Systemic Immune Inflammatory Index (SII)

*   **SII:** Calculated as Platelets x (Neutrophil / Lymphocyte Ratio).
*   A higher SII is more likely to be found in refractory cachexia.

## Potential Implications

*   Maintaining relatively high levels of albumin, hemoglobin, and lymphocytes, and resisting age-related declines, may be important for delaying cancer cachexia progression.
*   Tracking these biomarkers could potentially help in managing or delaying the progression of cancer cachexia.
