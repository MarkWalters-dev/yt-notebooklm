# 2020-06-27 Quantifying Phenotypic Age - Blood Test Measurement 3 in 2020

## Executive Summary

*   Phenotypic age is a measure of disease risk and risk of death, calculated using standard blood chemistry panels and C-reactive protein (CRP).
*   The author's chronological age is 47, but their phenotypic age, based on three measurements in 2020, averages 32.78 years, indicating a 14+ year difference.
*   Seasonal allergies (hay fever) significantly impact biological age markers, particularly increasing C-reactive protein levels during June and July.
*   Calorie restriction has been shown to reduce phenotypic age, as observed by a significant drop from September to October 2019.
*   While overall phenotypic age is improving, elevated glucose and creatinine levels indicate potential declines in kidney function and are areas for future intervention.

## Phenotypic Age Measurement in 2020

The author's phenotypic age is calculated using a standard blood chemistry screen (CBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP).

**June 2020 Measurement Findings:**

*   **Positive Indicators:** High albumin, stellar lymphocyte percentage, biological youth values for mean red blood cell volume and red cell distribution width, alkaline phosphatase.
*   **Negative Indicators:** Higher than expected creatinine, higher than expected glucose, higher than average C-reactive protein, higher than average white blood cells.
*   **Result:** Phenotypic age of approximately 34 years.

**Comparison of 2020 Measurements:**

*   **March 2020:** Phenotypic age was approximately 2.33 years younger than the June measurement.
*   **February 2020:** Phenotypic age was approximately 32.75 years.
*   **Average Phenotypic Age (Jan-June 2020):** 32.78 years, which is approximately 14 years younger than the chronological age of 47.

**Impact of Health Events on Phenotypic Age:**

*   **February 2020 Respiratory Infection:** An increase in white blood cells due to infection temporarily raised phenotypic age.
*   **Recovery (One Month Later):** White blood cell counts normalized, leading to a phenotypic age reduction of over one year.
*   **June 2020 Hay Fever:** Characterized by sneezing, stuffy nose, and red, itchy eyes, this condition significantly increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels to 0.53 mg/L, which is double the author's usual level outside of June.

## 2019 Phenotypic Age Data

Two measurements were taken in 2019, and CRP levels were included retrospectively.

*   **September 2019:** Phenotypic age was approximately 35 years.
*   **October 2019:** Phenotypic age improved to approximately 31.3 years.

**Intervention:** Calorie restriction was initiated in September 2019, reducing daily intake by 200-300 calories.

**Average Phenotypic Age (2019):** 33.44 years.

**Comparison to 2020:** The average phenotypic age in 2019 (33.44 years) is similar to the average for the first half of 2020 (32.78 years). The overall average across both years is approximately 33 years, maintaining a 14-year difference from chronological age.

## 2018 Phenotypic Age Data

One CRP measurement was available from 2018.

*   **June 2018 Measurement:** C-reactive protein was 0.67 mg/L. This elevated level is consistent with the author's experience of doubled CRP during June measurements due to hay fever.
*   **Phenotypic Age (2018):** Approximately 34.5 years.

**Trend Comparison (June Measurements):**

*   **June 2018:** Phenotypic age ~34.5 years.
*   **June 2020:** Phenotypic age reduced by 0.5 years, despite a chronological age increase of two years. This suggests a positive trend in improving year-over-year June measurements.

## Areas for Improvement

Despite overall positive trends, certain biomarkers indicate room for improvement:

*   **Glucose Levels:** Consistently measured in the high 90s mg/dL (e.g., 99 mg/dL in June 2020), trending upwards since 2018. Lower glucose levels, closer to 80 mg/dL, are associated with reduced all-cause mortality and biological youth.
*   **Creatinine Levels:** Consistently trending towards 1.0 mg/dL or higher, suggesting a reduction in kidney function over the past two years.

Future videos will explore the associations between diet, creatinine, and glucose levels, with the goal of implementing interventions to further reduce phenotypic age.
