# 2023-07-05 35% Increase For Heart Rate Variability Since 2018

### Executive Summary

*   Resting heart rate (RHR) generally increases until approximately 50 years of age, then declines. Relatively low RHR can be observed in both young and advanced ages.
*   Heart rate variability (HRV) consistently declines with increasing age.
*   A low RHR coupled with high HRV is indicative of physiological youth, whereas a low RHR with low HRV suggests advanced age.
*   The speaker significantly reduced their average annual RHR from 50.9 beats per minute (2018) to 43.7 beats per minute (first half of 2023).
*   The speaker significantly increased their average annual HRV (RMSSD) from 47.3 milliseconds (2018) to 63.9 milliseconds (first half of 2023), representing a 35% increase and indicating a physiologically youthful state.

## Physiological Basis of Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability

Resting heart rate (RHR) and heart rate variability (HRV) provide information about cardiovascular health, the nervous system, and adrenal gland function. These variables are impacted by the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, specifically involving the vagus nerve. Additionally, the adrenal gland releases norepinephrine and epinephrine, which influence RHR and HRV.

## Resting Heart Rate (RHR) Changes During Aging

WHOOP data for individuals aged 20-50 years shows that resting heart rate (RHR) increases for both men and women up to age 50. A study of approximately 90,000 Fitbit users, covering an age range of 20-85 years, further corroborates this: RHR increases until around 50 years old, after which it declines. This indicates that relatively low RHRs are found in both young and advanced ages.

## Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Changes During Aging

Heart rate variability (HRV), specifically measured as Root Mean Squared of Successive Differences (RMSSD), was tracked across an age range of 20-60 years. Regardless of the time of day (morning or night), HRV consistently declines with aging.

## Differentiating Youth vs. Advanced Age Based on RHR and HRV

To determine if a relatively low resting heart rate indicates youth or advanced age, HRV provides crucial context:

*   **Younger Ages:** A relatively low RHR is observed in conjunction with a relatively high HRV.
*   **Advanced Ages:** A low RHR is expected in conjunction with a low HRV.

## Personal Data: Resting Heart Rate (2018-2023)

Since August 2018, the speaker has tracked RHR data daily. From 2018 to the first six months of 2023, a significant reduction in average yearly RHR has been observed:

*   **2018:** 50.9 beats per minute (bpm)
*   **2022:** 45.0 bpm
*   **First 6 months of 2023:** 43.7 bpm

This represents a significant reduction in RHR compared to both 2018 and 2022 data.

## Personal Data: Heart Rate Variability (2018-2023)

Over the same tracking period, the speaker has observed a significant increase in HRV (RMSSD):

*   **2018:** 47.3 milliseconds (ms)
*   **2022:** 59.3 ms
*   **First 6 months of 2023:** 63.9 ms

This 2023 average represents a 35% increase compared to 2018 data, and is significantly higher than both 2018 and 2022 data.

## Conclusion on Personal Physiological Age

Based on chronological age (a little over 50 years), the expected HRV would be around 35 ms and RHR around 57 bpm. However, the speaker's average HRV for the first half of 2023 is 63.9 ms, and RHR is 43.7 bpm. This combination of a relatively low RHR and a high HRV indicates a physiologically youthful state, despite chronological age.
