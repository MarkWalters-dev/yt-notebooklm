# 2025-03-02 What s The Best Way To Optimize NAD Jin-Xiong She PhD

**Executive Summary:**
*   NAD is a crucial molecule involved in over 500 enzyme functions, particularly ATP production and cellular energy, but its levels rapidly decline with age, with 75% of individuals being suboptimal or deficient by age 30.
*   Oral NAD precursors, especially NMN-based supplements like Genfinity's Vitality Boost, effectively increase intracellular NAD levels, often doubling them within 2-4 weeks, unlike NAD IV or subcutaneous injections which show limited or no impact on intracellular NAD.
*   Personalized testing (Test, Act, Optimize - TAO strategy) is vital because optimal NAD levels (recommended 40-100 micromolar, with a sweet spot of 50-75 micromolar) and effective dosages vary significantly between individuals.
*   High doses of Niacin (nicotinic acid) can lead to excessively high NAD levels (above 150 micromolar) and increase vascular inflammation and cardiovascular risk through elevated nicotinamide metabolites (2-py and 4-py).
*   While exercise and diet are beneficial for health, they typically provide only small (10-20%) increases in NAD, often insufficient for optimization. In some cases, excessive training can even lead to lower NAD levels due to increased inflammation.

## Importance of NAD

NAD is a vital molecule, often referred to as the "supernova of molecules," because it is involved in the function of over 500 other enzymes. Without NAD, life is nearly impossible. Its most critical function is the production of cellular energy (ATP) primarily in the mitochondria. Without sufficient NAD, cells cannot produce ATP, leading to a lack of energy for bodily functions.

Beyond ATP production, NAD supports numerous other functions across every cell, tissue, and organ in the body. It is crucial for muscle function, brain function (which consumes over 20% of the body's energy despite being only 2% of body weight), and many other cellular processes.

## NAD Decline with Age

NAD levels unfortunately decline with age. Data from tens of thousands of NAD tests reveal that this decline is rapid and begins surprisingly early:
*   In teenagers, 75% have NAD levels above 40 micromolar, but about 25% are already suboptimal or deficient.
*   By the late twenties/early thirties, approximately 75% of individuals are suboptimal or deficient in NAD.
*   In individuals in their forties, fifties, and sixties and beyond, NAD levels are only about 30-50% of what is typically seen in very young children.

This decline in NAD levels is associated with various health issues and the overall aging process.

## Strategies to Elevate NAD

There are four main categories of strategies to increase NAD levels or slow their degradation:
1.  **Inhibit NAD Degrading Enzymes:** NAD is degraded by enzymes such as CD38 and those involved in DNA repair. Inhibiting these enzymes could theoretically slow NAD degradation and increase levels, but this strategy is practically very difficult.
2.  **Increase NAD Synthesizing Enzymes:** Promoting the activity of enzymes like NAMPT and NMAT, which are key in NAD biosynthesis, is an important strategy.
3.  **Direct NAD+ Administration:** NAD IV (intravenous) has been used for decades to treat various neurological and infectious diseases. However, its efficacy for general longevity and wellness optimization is a subject of ongoing study.
4.  **NAD Precursors:** Providing the building blocks that cells use to make NAD is a common strategy. There are at least five or six known precursors.

## Genfinity's TAO Strategy: Test, Act, Optimize

To effectively optimize NAD, the "TAO" strategy (Test, Act, Optimize) is crucial.

### NAD Testing Methodology
Genfinity developed the first reliable, reproducible, and easy-to-use at-home NAD test.
*   **Procedure:** Uses a finger prick to collect dried blood spots.
*   **Innovation:** A stabilizing buffer ensures NAD stability in the sample.
*   **Reliability:** Tested on 50,000-60,000 individuals across six countries, demonstrating very good reproducibility (average deviation of 3.1% between two tests of the same sample), comparable to FDA-approved clinical tests.

### Personalized Optimization Examples

**Case 1: Gentleman Optimizing NMN Dosage**
*   **Baseline:** Highly deficient NAD (< 20 micromolar).
*   **Action:** Started taking Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN).
    *   100 mg/day: No significant change.
    *   Gradually increased dosage: NAD levels rose but did not reach the optimal range.
    *   2000 mg/day: NAD levels reached the top of the optimal range.
    *   **Optimization:** Dosage was reduced to 1500 mg/day of NMN to maintain levels in the middle of the optimal range (around 65-70 micromolar).

**Case 2: 68-year-old Lady and Supplement Efficacy**
*   **Baseline:** Very deficient NAD.
*   **Action:**
    *   Initially tried three different NAD supplements on the market without success.
    *   Switched to a fourth NMN-based supplement (1000 mg/day).
    *   Result: Her NAD level increased by over 600% to approximately 168 micromolar, which was considered too high.
    *   **Optimization:** Dosage was gradually reduced to 500 mg/day of NMN to achieve the middle of the optimal range, yielding the best health benefits.

These cases highlight the necessity of testing and individual dose adjustment, as one person may need 500 mg while another requires 1500 mg or more.

### Optimal NAD Range
Based on accumulated data, the optimal range for NAD is between 40 and 100 micromolar, with a "sweet spot" identified between 50 and 75 micromolar for most tangible health benefits. Levels above 150 micromolar are generally considered too high.

### Genfinity's Vitality Boost Clinical Trial
Genfinity's proprietary NMN-based supplement, Vitality Boost, was tested in a clinical trial:
*   **Baseline:** Average NAD levels around 28 micromolar.
*   **After 2 weeks:** NAD levels increased by over 100%.
*   **After 4 weeks:** Levels continued to increase for some individuals, but for most, the peak was observed around two weeks post-supplementation.
*   **Retesting:** It is recommended to retest NAD levels 2 to 4 weeks after starting or changing a supplement regimen to ensure optimization, rather than waiting for several months.
*   **Average Dosage Requirement:** Approximately 70% of individuals need 1000 mg of NMN to reach optimal NAD levels, while 25% require more than 1000 mg, and about 5% need less than 1000 mg.

### Comparison of Vitality Boost vs. Pure NMN
Clinical data from various clinics shows that while pure NMN does increase NAD levels, Genfinity's Vitality Boost formulation demonstrates higher efficacy in optimizing NAD for a larger proportion of individuals. This effectiveness extends to older patient populations, including those with heart failure.

## NAD Administration Methods: IV and Subcutaneous Injections

### NAD IV Efficacy
*   While NAD IV has clinical efficacy for specific neurological and infectious conditions, its impact on intracellular NAD levels for general longevity and wellness is questioned.
*   A clinical trial involving 10 individuals receiving five sessions of NAD IV (750 mg NAD+ per session) showed **no change in intracellular NAD levels**.
*   When these same individuals were subsequently given oral Vitality Boost, their NAD levels significantly increased, with most reaching above 40 micromolar. This suggests oral supplements can be more effective at increasing intracellular NAD.

### Subcutaneous NAD Injections
*   Subcutaneous NAD injections do increase NAD levels, unlike NAD IV, possibly due to slower degradation outside the bloodstream, allowing more time for cellular absorption.
*   However, the levels achieved are often not high enough, typically remaining in the 30s micromolar range for tested individuals.
*   Similar to the IV study, subsequent oral supplementation with Vitality Boost proved to be much more effective than subcutaneous injections in raising NAD levels.

## NAD Precursor Efficacy: NMN, Nicotinamide, Niacin

### Nicotinamide (NAM)
*   Published data suggests that nicotinamide increases NAD levels by about 10% on average.
*   Genfinity's clinical trial indicated that nicotinamide could increase NAD levels in approximately 30% of participants by about 30%, which is consistent with the overall 10% average increase.
*   Taking around 1000 mg of nicotinamide is unlikely to optimize NAD levels for most individuals. Testing is crucial to determine individual response.

### Niacin (Nicotinic Acid)
*   High doses of niacin (1000-2000 mg), often used to reduce cholesterol, can cause NAD levels to "shoot through the roof," frequently reaching 150 micromolar or higher. This is considered excessively high, beyond the optimal range of 40-100 micromolar.
*   A recent paper (published ~3 months prior to this discussion) indicated that high-dose niacin for cardiovascular benefits increases the concentration of two nicotinamide metabolites, 2-py and 4-py. These metabolites are terminal byproducts of nicotinamide (a breakdown product of NAD) and can increase vascular inflammation and cardiovascular risk.
*   **Recommendation:** Anyone taking high-dose niacin for health purposes should consider getting their NAD levels tested and potentially measuring vascular inflammation biomarkers.
*   **New Research:** Genfinity is making a significant discovery related to niacin and NAD, which will be released in an upcoming book. They are actively seeking participants (offering near-free NAD tests) who take high-dose niacin to gather more data on this important public health issue.

## Personal Experience & Broader Longevity

One individual, age 62/63, has been using NAD optimization and biohacking for 4-5 years, experiencing significant health benefits including:
*   Cured asthma, allergies, sciatica, arthritis, and back pain.
*   Significant improvement in tennis performance (playing 4 hours, twice a week, competing with younger individuals with excellent endurance and recovery).
*   Weight loss of 10 pounds and reduction in triglycerides after significantly reducing carbohydrate intake (e.g., eliminating rice).

NAD optimization is considered the most important single component of a comprehensive longevity program. Current technologies, combined with a holistic approach, are believed to have the potential to extend healthspan and lifespan by at least 20-30 years.

## The Healthspan vs. Lifespan Debate

While some studies on NAD and lifespan show modest or no effects, particularly in mice, there are limitations:
*   Mouse studies are often conducted on inbred mice in sterile environments, which lack the genetic and environmental variability of outbred populations, potentially masking significant effects.
*   The primary focus should be on extending *healthspan* – living healthier for longer. By extending healthspan, an increase in lifespan is a natural consequence.
*   The goal is to enable people to maintain vitality and engage in their favorite activities (e.g., playing tennis) at 100 years old and beyond. Achieving 100 years of healthy life would imply a lifespan of 110-120 years.

## Impact of Diet, Exercise, and Inflammation on NAD

### Diet and Exercise Limitations
It is often assumed that diet and exercise can significantly increase NAD levels. However:
*   While some exercise and diet interventions may increase NAD, the increase is typically small (e.g., 10-20%), which is often insufficient to make a noticeable difference in health or performance for most individuals who need to double or triple their NAD levels.
*   For about 90% of individuals, the primary deficit is in the supply of NAD precursors, while 10% may have deficiencies in NAD-synthesizing enzymes or precursor absorption.
*   Paradoxically, individuals who exercise intensely or overtrain (e.g., a young boxing champion with NAD levels as low as 19.1 micromolar) can have lower NAD levels, potentially due to increased inflammation. Inflammation is a major factor in reduced NAD levels.

### Gut Microbiome Role
Microorganisms in the gut utilize NAD in their metabolic processes and may contribute to NAD levels in the body, but the extent of this impact and the feasibility of manipulating the microbiome to increase NAD are currently unknown.

### Tryptophan as a Precursor
Tryptophan is an NAD precursor but requires many chemical steps for conversion. It has been found to be inefficient in increasing NAD levels. One individual experienced severe gastrointestinal pain at 2 grams/day of tryptophan, with no observable increase in NAD.

## Emerging and Important Biomarkers

Genfinity employs three criteria for selecting biomarkers:
1.  **Clinical relevance and scientific evidence:** The biomarker must have a strong scientific basis and be related to health outcomes.
2.  **Reproducible assays:** The test for the biomarker must be reliable and consistent.
3.  **Actionability:** The biomarker's results must lead to clear, actionable steps for intervention or optimization.

### Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) Proteins
Genfinity measures four key SASP proteins:
*   IL-1 beta
*   IL-6
*   IL-8
*   TNF-alpha
Among these, IL-8 is considered a highly responsive and effective biomarker for detecting health issues, with increases often observed in multiples of ten or even a hundred-fold in individuals with health problems.

### Senescence-Associated Beta-Galactosidase (SA-beta-gal)
SA-beta-gal is identified as the best single biomarker for senescence, showing increases in individuals with various diseases and correlating with patient response to therapy and survival in studies (e.g., cancer patients).

### Clotho Protein
Clotho is an important and responsive biomarker for overall health.
*   It is often deficient in individuals with kidney problems (though not 100% of cases).
*   Levels are also severely deficient in a significant proportion of cancer and Alzheimer's patients.
*   Clotho levels can precipitously drop after infections like COVID.
*   Its responsiveness to changing health conditions makes it valuable for detecting hidden health issues.

### Kidney Function Biomarkers
*   **Creatinine:** While an increase can indicate declining kidney function, it's also affected by muscle mass and creatine supplementation. Biohackers taking creatine often see elevated creatinine, which can cause confusion if not interpreted alongside other markers.
*   **Cystatin C:** Measured alongside creatinine to estimate Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), providing a more accurate assessment of kidney function, especially in individuals with altered muscle mass or creatine intake.

### Ergothioneine
Ergothioneine is a metabolite whose levels decline with age. Rich sources include mushrooms. There are currently no widely available commercial tests for ergothioneine, but Genfinity is exploring the development of such a test and has observed improvements in other biomarkers in individuals supplementing with it.

### Quinolinate
Quinolinate is a neurotoxic metabolite that increases with aging. While there is interest in measuring toxins and microplastics, the challenge lies in actionability and cost-effective intervention (e.g., plasma apheresis is very expensive). However, through a 'test, act, optimize' approach, individuals could track quinolinate levels in conjunction with diet, exercise, and supplements to identify personal strategies for keeping levels low.
