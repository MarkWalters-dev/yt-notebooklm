# 2022-01-30 Quantifying Biological Age - Blood Test 1 in 2022 Test 35 Since 2015

## Executive Summary

*   The latest blood test in January 2022 revealed a phenotypic age of 32.6 years, which is 16.4 years younger than the chronological age.
*   This latest phenotypic age represents the lowest biological age recorded across 16 tests since 2018.
*   The calculated aging.ai biological age is 26 years, a reduction of 23 years compared to chronological age, and is tied for the best result since 2009.
*   There appears to be a seasonal trend, with the lowest biological age readings observed in the early months of the year (February and March) in both 2020 and 2021.
*   Maintaining consistent biological age readings with less variability is the current priority, rather than further incremental reductions.

## Phenotypic Age Calculation (PhenoAge)

*   **Latest Measurement (January 2022):**
    *   Chronological Age: Not specified, but assumed to be 49 years (32.6 + 16.4).
    *   Phenotypic Age: 32.6 years.
    *   Age Difference: 16.4 years younger than chronological age.
*   **Historical Data:**
    *   **2020:** 6 measurements, average phenotypic age of 35.6 years.
    *   **2021:** 6 measurements, average phenotypic age of 35.6 years.
    *   **2018-2019:** 3 measurements.
    *   The current measurement of 32.6 years is the lowest over these 16 tests since 2018.

## Seasonal Trend Observation

*   The lowest phenotypic age readings in 2020 and 2021 were observed in February and March.
    *   **2020:** Lowest values of 34.6 years (February) and 33.5 years (March).
    *   **2021:** Lowest value on March 1st.
*   This suggests a potential seasonal influence on biological age markers, with better results in the early part of the year.

## Improvement Potential and Priorities

*   **Past Average Reduction:** Prior to this test, the average phenotypic age reduction relative to chronological age was 11.9 years over 15 tests.
*   **Current Assessment:** The 16.4-year reduction is considered near optimal for the individual.
*   **Potential for Small Improvements:** Minor reductions in glucose and creatinine might be achievable, but the effort may negatively impact other markers.
*   **Main Priority:** Consistently maintaining the current biological age readings test-to-test and reducing variability is the primary focus. Avoiding significant fluctuations (e.g., 39.8 in 2020, 37.1 in 2021) is key.
*   **PhenoAge Limitation:** Chronological age is included in the PhenoAge model, which inherently limits the maximum achievable biological age reduction.

## Aging.AI Biological Age Calculation

*   **Latest Measurement (January 2022):**
    *   Aging.AI Version: 3.0 (19 components).
    *   Biological Age: 26 years.
    *   Age Difference: 23 years younger than chronological age.
*   **Historical Data:**
    *   **2009-2013:** 3 blood tests, average aging.ai age of 32 years.
    *   **2016-2021:** 27 blood tests, average aging.ai age of 29.9 years.
    *   The current result of 26 years is tied for the best aging.ai age recorded over 31 tests since 2009.
    *   The only other time this age was achieved was in 2016.

## Future Considerations

*   **Sustainability of Reduction:** Whether the current biological age reductions (16.4 years for PhenoAge, 23 years for aging.ai) can be maintained will be tracked in future blood tests.
*   **Contributing Factors:** Upcoming videos will explore the role of diet, fitness, and supplements in these results.
*   **Lipid Panel Assessment:** The current values for total cholesterol (130 mg/dL), HDL (41 mg/dL), and LDL (75 mg/dL) will be assessed in relation to all-cause mortality risk in a future discussion.

## Data Notes

*   Quest's high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured at less than 0.3 mg/L. This value could be 0.3 mg/L or lower, as it is below the assay's detection limit.
*   All raw blood test data from the lab is available for review.
