# 2022-12-31 Body Composition Assessment DEXA 12 2022

## Executive Summary

*   DEXA assessment revealed a total body fat percentage of 12.9%.
*   Total fat mass was 9.2 kg, with a total lean mass calculated at approximately 59.3 kg.
*   Total Bone Mineral Content (BMC) measured 2.5 kg.
*   Lean mass, as determined by DEXA, encompasses muscle mass, organ weights, and water, not exclusively muscle tissue.
*   The long-term objective is to maintain or improve lean and bone mineral content while reducing fat mass to counteract typical age-related changes.

## DEXA Methodology

Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) utilizes X-rays to precisely quantify the amounts of fat mass, lean mass, and bone mineral content (BMC) in the body. The assessment provides a regional breakdown for areas including the left and right arms, trunk, left and right legs, head, and an overall total.

## Body Composition Results

The body composition assessment provided the following measurements:

*   **Total Fat, Lean, and Bone Mineral Content (DEXA Total):** 71 kg
*   **Fasting Body Weight (pre-DEXA, without clothes):** 68 kg
    *   *Note on weight disparity:* The 3 kg difference between the fasting weight and the DEXA total is attributed to clothing worn during the scan and potentially undigested food.
*   **Total Fat Mass:** 9.2 kg
*   **Body Fat Percentage:** 12.9% (calculated by dividing total fat mass by the total fat, lean, and bone mineral content)
*   **Lean Mass + Bone Mineral Content:** 62.8 kg
*   **Total Bone Mineral Content (BMC):** 2.5 kg (measured across regions including arms, ribs, spine, pelvis, legs, and head)

### Lean Mass Calculation

Total whole body lean mass was calculated by subtracting BMC from the combined lean and bone mineral content:
61.8 kg (Lean + BMC) - 2.47 kg (BMC) = 59.3 kg (Total Lean Mass)

## Interpretation of Lean Mass

It is important to note that lean mass, as measured by DEXA, is not solely muscle mass. It includes muscle tissue, the weight of internal organs, and a significant amount of water.

## Future Objectives

The primary goal, particularly in the context of aging, is to maintain or improve lean mass and bone mineral content, both of which typically decline with age. Concurrently, the objective is to reduce fat mass, which tends to increase with age. A follow-up assessment is planned within the next 12 to 18 months to track progress toward these objectives.
