# 2025-01-08 82 Year Old Longevity Biohacker s Experience With Follistatin Gene Therapy

### Executive Summary

*   Follistatin gene therapy involves a single, systemic injection of plasmids encoding the follistatin protein, creating a "follistatin factory" in the abdomen for sustained production.
*   The therapy resulted in a significant increase in serum follistatin levels (doubled in 3 months, further 50% increase by 6 months) and a measurable gain in lean muscle mass (e.g., 4-5 lbs in a 120 lb individual) and improved cardiovascular capacity.
*   A key safety feature of the mini-circle plasmid technology is a 'killer switch,' allowing deactivation of the follistatin production via an injection (e.g., Doxycycline).
*   The systemic nature of the treatment allows the body to allocate the increased follistatin resources where most needed, leading to broad rejuvenative effects that lasted at least two years from a single administration.
*   The therapy appears most beneficial for individuals experiencing age-related degeneration, as younger individuals may already produce sufficient follistatin.

## Follistatin: Background and Mechanism

Follistatin is a naturally occurring protein found in mammalian bodies, with a molecular weight of approximately 235 kDa. Historically, it has been utilized in the agricultural industry to increase the muscle mass of livestock. In humans, follistatin naturally increases with age and physical deterioration (e.g., muscle and skeletal mass loss) as the body attempts to counteract these processes, but often cannot keep pace.

A primary mechanism of follistatin is its ability to inhibit myostatin, a protein that limits muscle growth. By inhibiting myostatin, follistatin allows for muscle hypertrophy and overall increased muscle mass.

## Follistatin Gene Therapy: Protocol and Safety

The follistatin gene therapy involves the administration of plasmids, which are circular strings of DNA. These plasmids are engineered to carry the genetic code for producing the follistatin protein.

### Therapy Protocol:

1.  **Plasmid Injection:** Plasmids are injected into the abdomen.
2.  **Replication and Production:** Once injected, the plasmids replicate, establishing a localized "follistatin factory" in the abdomen. This factory continuously produces and releases follistatin into the bloodstream.

### Safety Features:

The mini-circle technology used for the plasmids incorporates a 'killer switch.' This safety mechanism involves an additional piece of DNA that allows for deactivation of the follistatin production. In the event of a serious adverse reaction, an injection of a substance like Doxycycline can be administered to eliminate the effect of the plasmids, providing a reversible safety factor.

## Observed Results and Benefits

An 82-year-old individual received the follistatin gene therapy injection two years prior to these observations.

### Serum Follistatin Levels:

*   **3 months post-injection:** Serum follistatin levels doubled.
*   **6 months post-injection:** Serum follistatin levels increased an additional 50% from the 3-month mark (e.g., from 8.5 units to 17 units at 3 months, then to 22-24 units at 6 months).

### Lean Muscle Mass:

DEXA scans conducted after the treatment indicated an increase in lean muscle mass of approximately 4-5 pounds. For an individual weighing 120 pounds, this represents a significant increase in lean body mass percentage.

### Functional Improvements:

Prior to the treatment, the individual experienced significant difficulty with physical exertion, such as walking long distances through an airport, requiring frequent stops for rest. Post-treatment, within two months, the individual reported a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular capacity and endurance, enabling them to run and dance with ease. This improvement in physical function was observed to be sustained for at least two years following the single injection.

### Systemic Rejuvenation and Resource Allocation:

The follistatin gene therapy acts as a systemic treatment, providing the body with an increased resource pool of follistatin. The body then allocates this resource according to its immediate needs. For instance, the individual noted an early and significant improvement in cardiovascular capacity, suggesting the body prioritized this area. This systemic augmentation of available resources allows the body's inherent genetic programming, developed through evolutionary processes, to most effectively utilize them for overall rejuvenation and improved function.

## Target Population and Efficacy

While the therapy demonstrates significant benefits, not all individuals report particular improvements. This is often observed in younger individuals whose bodies naturally produce sufficient follistatin. The therapy appears most effective for those experiencing age-related degeneration, where an augmentation of natural follistatin levels can lead to measurable and sustained improvements in muscle mass, cardiovascular function, and overall physical capacity. The long-lasting effects of a single injection (at least two years) align with a focus on rejuvenative therapies rather than daily interventions.
