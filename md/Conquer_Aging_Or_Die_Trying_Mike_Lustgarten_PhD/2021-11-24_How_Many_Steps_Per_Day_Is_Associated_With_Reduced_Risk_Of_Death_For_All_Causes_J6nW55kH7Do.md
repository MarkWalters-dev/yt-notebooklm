# 2021-11-24 How Many Steps Per Day Is Associated With Reduced Risk Of Death For All Causes

## Executive Summary

*   Daily step counts below 3,300 steps per day are associated with a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality.
*   Any number of steps above zero significantly reduces the risk of all-cause mortality compared to no steps.
*   A significant decrease in all-cause mortality risk is observed for daily step counts between 3,300 and 11,000 steps.
*   Most of the all-cause mortality risk reduction occurs up to approximately 7,500 steps per day, with marginal further reductions between 7,500 and 11,000 steps (a 2% further risk reduction for every additional 1,000 steps).
*   Step counts exceeding 11,000 steps per day are not significantly associated with additional reductions in all-cause mortality risk.

## Study Methodology

This meta-analysis investigated the association between daily step counts and all-cause mortality risk.

*   **Studies Included:** 10 studies
*   **Total Subjects:** Approximately 30,000
*   **Age Range:** 45 to 79 years
*   **Median Follow-up:** 9 years
*   **Step Count Measurement:** Obtained by objective devices (Actigraph), not self-reported data.

## All-Cause Mortality Risk and Step Counts

The analysis assessed the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality against steps per day. Statistical significance was determined when the 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio was entirely below or entirely above a hazard ratio of one.

*   **Below 3,300 Steps/Day:** Compared to a referent of approximately 3,300 steps per day, individuals with lower step counts exhibited a significantly increased all-cause mortality risk.
*   **Any Steps vs. Zero Steps:** Any number of steps above zero was significantly better than none, as the risk of all-cause mortality began to decrease with increasing steps.
*   **Reduced Risk (3,300 to 11,000 Steps/Day):** A significantly decreased all-cause mortality risk was observed as daily steps increased from 3,300 up to approximately 11,000 steps.
*   **Plateau Effect (Around 7,500 Steps/Day):** All-cause mortality risk began to plateau at around 7,500 steps per day.
*   **Marginal Reduction (7,500 to 11,000 Steps/Day):** Above 7,500 steps per day, up to 11,000 steps, there was a marginal all-cause mortality risk reduction, equating to roughly a 2% further risk reduction for every additional 1,000 steps. Most of the mortality reduction occurred up to 7,500 steps.
*   **Above 11,000 Steps/Day:** More than 11,000 steps per day was not significantly associated with further reductions in all-cause mortality risk.
