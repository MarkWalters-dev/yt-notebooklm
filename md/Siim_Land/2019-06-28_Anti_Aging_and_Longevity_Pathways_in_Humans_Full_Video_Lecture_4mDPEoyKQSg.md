# 2019-06-28 Anti Aging and Longevity Pathways in Humans Full Video Lecture

**Executive Summary:**

*   Aging is characterized by nine hallmarks, including genomic instability, telomere attrition, mitochondrial dysfunction, and deregulated nutrient sensing.
*   The Free Radical and Mitochondrial Theories of Aging posit that reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage, particularly to mitochondria, is a primary driver of cellular degradation and aging.
*   Key longevity pathways in humans, such as Insulin/IGF-1 (IIS), FOXO/Sirtuins, and mTOR/AMPK, regulate cell growth, metabolism, and stress adaptation, influencing lifespan.
*   Caloric restriction and hormesis (beneficial stress) promote longevity by activating cellular cleanup processes like autophagy, enhancing mitochondrial efficiency, and improving stress resilience.
*   Telomeres, protective caps on chromosomes, shorten with age, limiting cell division and increasing disease risk, while telomerase activity can replenish their length.

## Immortality and Healthspan

While biological immortality in humans is not the goal, understanding species that exhibit it provides insights into longevity mechanisms. For example, *Turritopsis dohrnii*, known as the immortal jellyfish, can revert from an adult stage back into an immature polyp stage multiple times, suggesting no natural limit to its lifespan. Other species, like certain larvae beetles, can revert to earlier stages under starvation, and bacteria can be revived after thousands of years of hibernation in glaciers.

The primary goal in humans is to promote healthspan, with increased lifespan as a potential byproduct. A significant portion of lifespan is determined by environmental factors, including daily activities and ecological niche, rather than solely by genetics.

## Hallmarks of Aging

In 2013, López-Otín and colleagues published a review of the hallmarks of aging in different species, including mammals. These are:

*   **Genomic Instability:** Accumulation of genetic damage and mutations throughout life.
*   **Telomere Attrition:** Shortening of protective telomere caps on the ends of chromosomes that occurs during DNA replication.
*   **Epigenetic Alterations:** Changes in methylation patterns, post-translational modifications of histones, and chromatin remodeling.
*   **Loss of Proteostasis:** Dysfunctional protein folding, proteolysis (breakdown), and proteotoxicity, leading to the accumulation of damaged proteins.
*   **Deregulated Nutrient Sensing:** Inadequate growth hormone production related to the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway.
*   **Mitochondrial Dysfunction:** Old, worn-out mitochondria produce more reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress, damaging other cells.
*   **Cellular Senescence:** Accumulation of dead cells and an increase in cancer proliferation.
*   **Stem Cell Exhaustion:** Decline in the regenerative potential of tissues and a lack of replacement of old cells with new ones.
*   **Altered Intercellular Communication:** Miscommunication in endocrine, neuroendocrine, or neuronal systems that cause inflammation and other problems.

## Free Radical and Mitochondrial Theories of Aging

The **Free Radical Theory of Aging** states that organisms die due to the accumulation of free radical damage on cells over time. This damage is particularly critical in the mitochondria, which are the power plants of the cells responsible for producing energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

The **Mitochondrial Theory of Aging**, introduced in 1980, implicates mitochondria as the main targets of ROS damage. It proposes that energy generation by mitochondria damages mitochondrial macromolecules, including mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which then promotes aging. After a certain threshold, this damage produces too many reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing cell death and degradation.

This creates a vicious feedback loop:
Poorly Functioning Mitochondria -> Increased Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) -> Increased Oxidative Damage to Mitochondria and Healthy Cells -> More Dysfunctional Mitochondria -> Accelerated Aging

The key to preventing accelerated aging is to avoid the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and manage stress levels appropriately.

### Hormesis and Antioxidants

Exercise, while beneficial, also creates reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. However, this is considered a **hormetic dose**. Hormesis is a dose-specific response to a toxin or stressor that makes the organism stronger than it was before. Small amounts of stress induce adaptation, making the body more resilient.

Examples of hormetic stressors include:

*   Caloric restriction
*   Intermittent fasting
*   Exercise
*   Dietary phytonutrients
*   Cold exposure
*   Heat exposure
*   Hypoxia

Interestingly, taking high doses of exogenous antioxidants (like beta-carotene, Vitamin A, Vitamin E) has largely failed to be effective in fighting disease and may even increase mortality. The goal should be to promote the body's own endogenous antioxidant defense system rather than relying on external supplements.

## Longevity Pathways in Humans

In humans, several recognized longevity pathways control the aging process and its constituent mechanisms:

1.  **Growth Hormone, Insulin, and Insulin-like Growth Factor One (IGF-1) Signaling Pathway (IIS):** Regulates cell replication, nutrient storage, and nutrient partitioning.
2.  **FOXO-Sirtuin Pathway:** Includes proteins and transcription factors responsible for energy homeostasis and stress adaptation.
3.  **mTOR-AMPK Pathway:** Governs the homeostasis between anabolism (growth) and catabolism (breakdown and recycling).

These pathways interact and affect all parts of the aging process and mitochondrial functioning.

### The Insulin and Insulin-like Growth Factor One (IGF-1) Signaling Pathway (IIS)

*   **Insulin:** The main storage hormone, directing nutrient partitioning and glycogen replenishment. It helps cells store glucose into liver and muscle glycogen.
*   **Glucagon:** Secreted by the pancreas, its role is to raise blood sugar by mobilizing glycogen stores from the liver.

This system is tightly balanced:
High Blood Sugar -> Pancreas releases Insulin -> Glucose shuttled into cells (stored as glycogen or fat)
Low Blood Sugar -> Pancreas releases Glucagon -> Mobilizes liver glycogen -> Raises blood sugar

*   **IGF-1:** Promotes tissue growth and development. Its effects are mediated through the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), which is similar to the insulin receptor. IGF-1 is produced in the liver, stimulated by human growth hormone (HGH).
*   **IGF-1 Binding Protein (IGFBP):** Carries IGF-1 around the body and is regulated by insulin, helping to balance IGF-1 levels.

Reduced insulin signaling has been found to increase the lifespan of many species, including fruit flies, nematodes, and rodents, with lifespan increases of up to 20-30%.

**Example: *Caenorhabditis elegans* (Nematode Worms)**
These nematode worms have an average three-week lifespan. They can enter a "dauer" stage during periods of higher environmental stress (e.g., caloric restriction, extreme cold exposure). In this stage, they morphologically specialize to adapt to harsh conditions. Under laboratory conditions, dauer larvae can survive up to eight times longer, demonstrating how environmental stress and a prolonged life stage can dramatically extend lifespan.

### Sirtuins

Sirtuins are a family of proteins that act as metabolic sensors, influencing energy efficiency and fuel choice, leading to epigenetic changes. When sirtuins, such as SIRT6, are activated, insulin and IGF-1 signaling are repressed, and inflammation is reduced. Other sirtuins promote mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial repair, and DNA repair, all contributing to longevity. Caloric restriction is a primary method for activating sirtuins.

### Caloric Restriction, Autophagy, and Mitochondrial Dynamics

Caloric restriction and energy deprivation lower mTOR signaling, which in turn upregulates other energy homeostasis pathways such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and autophagy.

**Autophagy** is the process of self-healing and cellular turnover, in which the body recycles its old, worn-out components back into energy. It is essential for the life extension effects observed in fruit flies and other species, helping to recycle old material, prevent inflammation, lower oxidative stress, and generally make the body more energy efficient. Suppressing autophagy genes in genetically modified mice negates the longevity benefits of caloric restriction, even under starvation conditions. This highlights that autophagy is a critical mediator of caloric restriction's life-extending effects and suggests that activating autophagy without severe starvation could be a strategy for longevity.

A 2017 study in *Cell Metabolism* used nematode worms to show that restricting calories and manipulating AMPK promoted longevity by maintaining mitochondrial networks and increasing fatty acid oxidation. This process, in communication with peroxisomes (which regulate fat metabolism), led the worms to live longer by mobilizing their own fat stores.

**Mitochondrial Fission-Fusion Cycle:**
Mitochondria undergo dynamic changes characterized by fission (splitting) and fusion (merging) events.

Mitochondrial Network (Fusion State) -> Fission (Splitting)
*   **Result 1:** Mitochondrion with higher membrane potential -> Returns to the fusion cycle
*   **Result 2:** Mitochondrion with more depolarized membrane -> Stays solitary -> (If membrane potential remains depolarized) Loses ability to fuse -> Eliminated by **Mitophagy** (mitochondrial autophagy)

The mitochondrial fission-fusion cycles and fatty acid oxidation are required for the longevity benefits of caloric restriction, emphasizing energy efficiency and the recycling of dysfunctional mitochondria. These cycles are dependent on autophagy-modulating pathways like AMPK and mTOR.

### The mTOR and AMPK Pathway

*   **mTOR (mammalian Target of Rapamycin):** Responsible for cell growth, protein synthesis, and anabolism (building new tissue). mTOR inhibits autophagy because growth requires expanding energy and upregulating metabolism.
*   **AMPK (AMP-activated Protein Kinase):** A fuel sensor involved in balancing energy-deprived states. AMPK supports autophagy due to the energy-deprived state, allowing unneeded proteins to be broken down and recycled into amino acids essential for survival.

This interplay is fundamental to longevity:
Nutrient Starvation -> Decreased mTOR Signaling -> Upregulated AMPK -> Autophagy Activation -> Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency & Cellular Recycling -> Longevity

While excessive mTOR and insulin signaling are often related to accelerated aging and disease, they can be beneficial and even pro-longevity in specific, appropriate situations.

### FOXO Proteins

Adaptation to stress and harsh conditions is mediated through specific transcription factors called **FOXO proteins** (Forkhead box proteins). FOXO proteins regulate longevity primarily through the insulin and IGF-1 pathway. Different types of FOXO proteins (e.g., FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO5) affect the body in various ways, including promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, reducing inflammation, and inhibiting apoptosis. The general trend of increasing FOXO activity is linked to energy deprivation and stress adaptation, which enhances resilience and promotes a longer lifespan.

### Telomeres

Telomeres are nucleotide sequences at the ends of each chromosome that function as protective caps against deterioration. The discovery of how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase was recognized with a Nobel Prize.

*   **Telomere Shortening:** Shortened telomeres prevent cells from replicating themselves by limiting the number of cell divisions. They also weaken the immune system and increase the risk of cancer. Many age-related diseases are linked to shortened telomeres.
*   **Telomere Length and Lifespan:** Longer telomeres are generally linked to longer lifespans, but telomeres that are too long are also not ideal and can accelerate aging.
*   **Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT):** This enzyme, a subunit of telomerase, can add more sequences to the ends of chromosomes, thus replenishing telomere length.

To promote longevity, it is crucial to avoid activities that shorten telomeres, such as:

*   Oxidative stress
*   Chronic inflammation
*   High psychological stress
*   Insufficient sleep
*   Other potential DNA damage-related factors

From an evolutionary perspective, these pathways evolved to promote the organism's survival under harsh conditions by enabling energy efficiency, recycling of cellular components, and minimizing excessive damage. Autophagy is considered one of the most critical components to longevity.

## The Code of Longevity

The code of longevity can be traced back to living a **hormetic lifestyle** that augments the body's resilience against physical stressors.

Key components of a hormetic lifestyle include:

*   Exercise
*   Sun exposure
*   Intermittent fasting
*   Dietary polyphenols
*   Adequate sleep
*   Cold exposure
*   Heat exposure

**Stress Management:** This is another critical component. The ability to tolerate and adapt to both physical and mental stressors is vital, as mental stress can significantly impact longevity. Practices like meditation, getting enough sleep, and taking time off are essential.
