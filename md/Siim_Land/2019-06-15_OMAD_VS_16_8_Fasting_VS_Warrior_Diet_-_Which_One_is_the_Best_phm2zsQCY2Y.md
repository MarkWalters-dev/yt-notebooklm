# 2019-06-15 OMAD VS 16 8 Fasting VS Warrior Diet - Which One is the Best

### Executive Summary

*   Physiologically, the body enters a true fasted state 4-6 hours after the last meal; therefore, a 16-hour fast provides approximately 10-12 hours of actual fasting.
*   Longer fasting protocols (20-23 hours, such as the Warrior Diet or OMAD) are generally more effective for inducing significant autophagy, promoting deeper ketosis, and achieving fat loss compared to the 16:8 method.
*   The 16:8 method is typically more conducive to muscle growth and resistance training due to a longer eating window for protein intake, while the Warrior Diet and OMAD are better suited for maintenance and fat loss but can make building strength and muscle more challenging.
*   Proper food choices within the eating window are crucial across all fasting methods to prevent issues like muscle loss, binge eating, or disrupted sleep.
*   The effectiveness of any intermittent fasting routine is highly dependent on individual adherence, metabolic adaptation, and how well it integrates with one's lifestyle, rather than one routine being universally "best."

## Introduction to Intermittent Fasting Methods

Intermittent fasting involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting. Popular methods include:

*   **16:8 Lean Gains Method:** Fast for 16 hours, eat within an 8-hour window. Typically involves skipping breakfast and having lunch and dinner.
*   **Warrior Diet:** Fast for 20 hours, eat within a 4-hour window. Usually involves a large dinner comprising a few meals.
*   **One Meal A Day (OMAD):** Fast for approximately 22-23 hours, eat all daily calories in a single meal within a 1-2 hour window.

Common goals for intermittent fasting include fat loss, increased autophagy, improved gut health, and general well-being.

## The 16:8 Lean Gains Method

The 16:8 Lean Gains method was prioritized for muscle growth and resistance training.

### Protocol

*   Fast for 16 hours.
*   Eat within an 8-hour window, typically skipping breakfast and having lunch and dinner.

### Pros

*   Excellent starting routine for beginners or those new to intermittent fasting.
*   Relatively easy to adopt, requiring only skipping a single meal.
*   Allows sufficient time for the body to exit the post-absorptive state of digestion and enter a fasted state.
    *   *Digestive Process:* Food intake -> Post-absorptive state (4-6 hours) -> Fasted state.
*   Does not interfere with resistance training or muscle hypertrophy once fat-adapted.
*   Enough time to consume all daily calories and stimulate muscle protein synthesis multiple times.
*   Supports higher levels of brain functioning and focus without constant thoughts about food.

### Cons

*   May not be sufficient to trigger significant autophagy, which generally requires longer fasting periods.
*   Sugar cravings and hunger may still be present during the fasted window.
*   Can be done incorrectly with frequent snacking and overeating during the 8-hour window.
*   The stated 16-hour fast is physiologically shorter due to digestion time:
    *   16 hours (perceived fast) - 4-6 hours (digestion) = 10-12 hours (actual fasted state).
*   Fasting for 18 hours offers similar benefits, potentially leading to deeper ketosis and increased fat burning, but without significant differences from 16 hours.

## The Warrior Diet

The Warrior Diet involves fasting for most of the day, followed by a workout and a large dinner.

### Protocol

*   Fast for approximately 20 hours.
*   Eat within a 4-hour window, typically consuming a large dinner.

### Pros

*   Facilitates fat burning and deeper ketosis.
*   Fasting becomes easier, with a significant reduction in hunger.
*   Effective for training the body before attempting extended fasts (e.g., 3-5 days).
*   Allows for large meals without excessive calorie counting, provided daily caloric allowance is respected.
*   Fasted exercise may increase autophagy.
*   Extended fasting periods can improve digestion and gut health.

### Cons

*   May be more challenging for progression in resistance training and strength building.
*   Risk of over-reliance on stimulants (e.g., coffee) to manage longer fasts.
*   Potential for binge eating after breaking the fast.
*   Improper food choices can lead to muscle loss and weakness.
*   Eating too close to bedtime can negatively impact sleep quality.
*   Less optimal for muscle growth compared to 16:8 or 18:6 due to a narrower window for protein synthesis, but sustainable for maintenance or lower-repetition resistance training.

## One Meal A Day (OMAD)

OMAD is a straightforward and effective fasting routine.

### Protocol

*   Fast for approximately 22-23 hours.
*   Eat all daily food within a 1-2 hour window.

### Pros

*   Highly effective for fat loss due to the extremely small eating window.
*   Fasting for 23-24 hours can induce significant autophagy with profound health benefits.
*   After proper fat adaptation, hunger and cravings are substantially reduced or eliminated.
*   Frees up mental energy and willpower by reducing decisions about food.
*   Provides extensive rest for the digestive system, potentially promoting long-term digestive health.
*   Enhances the body's efficiency in absorbing and retaining nutrients from food.
*   Allows for higher carbohydrate intake while potentially maintaining some level of keto-adaptation during the fasted state.

### Cons

*   Difficult to build strength and muscle, though not impossible.
*   Challenging to consume all necessary calories in a short timeframe for those not aiming for weight loss.
*   Suboptimal rates of protein synthesis due to the limited window for protein intake spikes.
*   Eating a large volume of food can cause bloating and discomfort.
*   Eating too close to bedtime can severely disrupt sleep quality.
*   Constant long-term fasting may lead to metabolic adaptation and increased stress.

## Overall Comparison and Conclusion

While OMAD and the Warrior Diet are highly effective for fat loss and maintenance, they are generally not optimal for significant muscle growth or resistance training. For individuals not focused on intense training, these methods can be highly sustainable and eliminate the need for frequent eating.

Even for those who prefer not to fast, adhering to a daily time-restricted eating schedule (e.g., consuming all calories within 8-10 hours) is recommended. Research suggests this practice is beneficial for circadian rhythm and offers various metabolic advantages.

Ultimately, there is no single "best" intermittent fasting method. Each routine has its strengths and weaknesses. The success of any fasting protocol depends more on the individual's consistency, adherence, and how well it integrates into their lifestyle and goals than on the specific parameters of the routine itself.
