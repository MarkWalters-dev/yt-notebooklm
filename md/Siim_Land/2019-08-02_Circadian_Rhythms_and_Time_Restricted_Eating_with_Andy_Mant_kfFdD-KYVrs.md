# 2019-08-02 Circadian Rhythms and Time Restricted Eating with Andy Mant

## Executive Summary

*   Disrupted circadian rhythms can independently cause leptin and insulin resistance, irrespective of diet, due to environmental light exposure.
*   Melatonin is a crucial hormone for sleep and also serves as a potent antioxidant, vital for cellular repair and reducing inflammation during sleep.
*   Optimal melatonin production requires morning light exposure (to synthesize serotonin) and darkness after sunset.
*   Insulin is identified as a primary entrainer for peripheral circadian clocks in various organs, making meal timing critical for metabolic synchronization.
*   Time-restricted eating, particularly with an early eating window (e.g., stopping meals before 3 PM), has been shown to improve weight loss and metabolic parameters, emphasizing the importance of synchronizing feeding times with circadian rhythms.

## Circadian Rhythms Basics

Every mammal on Earth possesses a circadian rhythm, which synchronizes bodily functions and every cell in the body with the Earth's rotation. This synchronization primarily relies on light and dark signals.

**Daily Circadian Cycle:**
Sunlight (morning) -> Cortisol release -> Alertness & Activity -> Brain signals cells to be active
Darkness (evening) -> Decreased Cortisol -> Serotonin/Tryptophan converted to Melatonin -> Sleepiness & Rest

## Blue Light and Health

Artificial light, especially modern LED and fluorescent lights, emits high amounts of blue light after dark. This artificial blue light signals the brain that it is still daytime, leading to elevated cortisol levels and suppressed melatonin production.

**Consequences of Artificial Light Exposure After Dark:**
*   Difficulty falling asleep and poor quality sleep (reduced deep and REM sleep).
*   Links to weight gain, insulin resistance, certain cancers, and neurological diseases.
*   Average human sleep duration has decreased by approximately two hours since the advent of artificial lighting.
*   Disrupted circadian rhythms, even with sufficient sleep, negatively impact health, including blood sugar management and satiety signaling.

## Circadian Rhythm Disruption and Metabolic Health

A disrupted circadian rhythm can directly lead to metabolic issues like leptin and insulin resistance, independent of dietary factors.

**Leptin Resistance Mechanism:**
Body fat increases -> Leptin hormone increases in adipose tissue
Normally: High Leptin -> Signals brain (via leptin receptors) to stop eating -> Increased satiety
Disrupted Circadian Rhythm -> Leptin receptors switch off -> Leptin cannot signal brain -> Continued eating despite high body fat -> Leptin Resistance

This suggests that chronic exposure to artificial light after dark, night shift work, or missing morning sunlight can cause leptin resistance by impairing leptin receptor function, even if high levels of leptin are circulating. Similarly, insulin resistance can develop due to circadian rhythm desynchronization.

The body experiences excessive stress and inflammation when out of sync with its circadian rhythm. This oxidative stress damages cells, contributing to the onset of various diseases.

## Melatonin: Sleep Hormone and Antioxidant

Melatonin is not solely a sleep hormone; it is also a very potent and powerful antioxidant.

**Melatonin's Dual Role:**
*   Aids sleep (partial truth).
*   Neutralizes inflammation and aids cellular repair at a mitochondrial level.

During sleep, the body undergoes processes like apoptosis (programmed cell death), autophagy (cellular cleanup), and clearance of adenosine, alongside general growth and repair. Melatonin secretion at this time helps clear waste products and damaged cells, maintaining health and low inflammation.

## Optimizing Melatonin Production

To produce sufficient melatonin at night, exposure to morning sunlight is crucial.

**Melatonin Production Pathway:**
Morning Sunlight exposure (eyes & skin) -> Serotonin production (in conjunction with Tryptophan from gut) -> Later, after sunset, Serotonin/Tryptophan converted to Melatonin

**Dietary Influence on Melatonin:**
*   Small amounts of sugary carbohydrates before bed can push tryptophan into the brain.
*   Tryptophan (an amino acid) competes with other amino acids to cross the blood-brain barrier.
*   Carbohydrates trigger insulin release, which helps clear other amino acids from the blood into cells, allowing more tryptophan to reach the brain.
*   **Optimal bedtime snack:** Small protein meal with a slightly larger amount of carbohydrates. Too much protein can stimulate the waking signal.

## Meal Timing and Circadian Rhythms

Light is the primary entrainer of the central master clock (suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus). However, peripheral clocks in organs like the liver and kidneys are entrained by other signals. Insulin, like IGF-1, has receptors in nearly every cell and acts as a potent entrainer of these peripheral clocks. This makes meal timing critical for synchronizing all bodily clocks.

**Optimal Meal Timing Guidelines:**
*   **Wait to eat:** The most optimal time to eat is about four hours after the morning cortisol response (after waking and getting morning light exposure). This aligns with the utilization of period genes in cells by the insulin response.
*   **Early eating window:** Eating the largest meal earlier in the day and stopping food intake before dark is beneficial.
    *   **Study Example:** Two groups with same calories, macros, exercise, and bedtimes.
        *   Group 1: Last meal before 3 PM -> Significant weight loss, better blood glucose control, increased sirtuin gene expression (longevity genes).
        *   Group 2: Last meal after 3 PM -> Less weight loss.
*   **Avoid late eating:** Eating large meals before bed is detrimental as digestion takes precedence over autophagy and cellular repair processes during sleep.
*   **Avoid common intermittent fasting pitfall:** Fasting in the morning and eating late into the evening (e.g., 2 PM to 8 PM) can desynchronize peripheral clocks, disrupt sleep, and hinder long-term weight management.
*   **Recommended Time-Restricted Eating Protocol:**
    1.  Wake up with the sunrise and get light exposure.
    2.  Wait approximately 3-4 hours after waking for the first meal.
    3.  Have the largest meal around 10-11 AM.
    4.  Stop eating before 3 PM (or at least 4-5 hours before bed).
    5.  Allow a fasting period from 3 PM until the next morning.
    6.  A small, light snack (e.g., half a banana) can be consumed closer to bedtime if needed, ideally with a small amount of protein and more carbs.

**Cortisol and Eating:**
*   Morning cortisol spikes help burn fat and trigger ketone production. Eating immediately after waking can suppress this beneficial cortisol response.
*   Artificial blue light from devices and indoor lighting keeps cortisol levels chronically high. Eating under these conditions means consuming calories with elevated cortisol, which can be counterproductive to health goals.

## Exercise and Circadian Rhythms

Exercise also acts as a signaling factor to circadian rhythms.

**Optimal Exercise Timing:**
*   **Morning movement:** Light cardiovascular activity (e.g., walking dog, gentle movement) in the morning with sunrise exposure is important for getting lymph flowing and setting circadian rhythms.
*   **Strength training:** Muscle contraction and strength tend to increase later in the day, in the afternoon, as the nervous system warms up. This may be an optimal time for more intense workouts, reducing injury risk.
*   **Avoiding late-night intense workouts:** Training late at night under artificial blue light can disrupt sleep by elevating cortisol and suppressing melatonin. If training after dark, using blue-light-blocking glasses and covering skin can mitigate negative effects.

**Athlete Examples:**
*   Professional athletes like Chris Gethin (bodybuilder), Jordan Henderson (footballer), Michael Phelps, and Roger Federer prioritize sleep for performance and recovery.
*   Chris Gethin reported improved strength and sleep quality (tracked with Oura Ring) by managing light exposure during evening workouts.
*   Jordan Henderson improved sleep by wearing blue-light-blocking glasses while playing video games after training, leading to better recovery and performance.
*   Sleep deprivation impairs cognition, reaction times, and focus, directly impacting athletic performance and decision-making.

## Sleep Pressure and Caffeine

There are two main factors influencing sleep: circadian rhythm and sleep pressure.

**Sleep Pressure Mechanism:**
Metabolic processes (breathing, organ function, exercise) -> Consume Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) -> Byproduct: Adenosine
Increased Adenosine in brain -> Increased sleep pressure -> Need more sleep to clear Adenosine

Sedentary individuals have less adenosine buildup and thus require less sleep than highly active individuals like professional athletes.

**Caffeine's Role:**
Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors.
Caffeine intake -> Blocks adenosine's ability to signal tiredness to the brain -> Feel alert
Caffeine's effects can last up to six hours, interfering with sleep if consumed late in the afternoon or evening. This, combined with blue light exposure, severely disrupts circadian rhythm and sleep quality.

## Holistic Health Approach

Health is a complex interplay of various factors, not just a single "hack."
It encompasses:
*   Nutrition
*   Circadian Rhythms (light/dark exposure)
*   Sleep
*   Exercise
*   Environmental factors (e.g., temperature cues, non-native EMFs)
*   Stress management (e.g., meditation, relaxation techniques)

Focusing on only one aspect, like diet or exercise, while neglecting others (like sleep or light exposure), will likely lead to suboptimal results and health plateaus. An individualized, experimental approach is necessary to determine what works best for each person.

## Ancestral Eating Reconsidered

While ancestral lifestyles offer lessons, directly emulating hunter-gatherer eating patterns may not be optimal for modern humans.

**Hunter-Gatherer Context:**
*   Ate opportunistically, often large meals when food was available, potentially late at night.
*   Nature favored weight gain in ancestors to provide fuel for prolonged hunting periods and survival during food scarcity. They needed fat for fuel and were not aiming for low body fat.
*   Ate under natural light conditions.

**Modern Context:**
*   Constant food availability and artificial light.
*   Eating large, processed meals under artificial light before bed can lead to weight gain and metabolic issues.
*   Modern humans strive for thriving, not just survival, requiring a different approach to diet and lifestyle.

## Individualized Sleep Optimization

Optimizing sleep requires personal experimentation with various strategies, as what works for one person may not work for another.

**Sleep Optimization Strategies (Experimentation Recommended):**
*   **Environment:**
    *   **Lavender:** Essential oil diffuser or natural spray for pillows can promote relaxation and increase REM sleep (possibly via GABA stimulation).
    *   **Room Temperature:** A cool room (e.g., 10-12 degrees Celsius) is often conducive to sleep by lowering body temperature.
    *   **Hot Shower/Bath:** Can relax muscles and aid sleep, but allow time for body temperature to cool before bed.
*   **Dietary:**
    *   **Small sugary carbohydrate before bed:** May push tryptophan into the brain, aiding melatonin production and suppressing waking signals.
    *   **Glycine:** Some find 4-5 mg helpful, others report no effect.
*   **Mind-Body:**
    *   **Meditation/Mindfulness:** Proven to reduce stress, improve mental clarity, and enhance sleep quality.
    *   **Relaxation techniques.**
    *   **Binaural beats:** Specific frequencies designed to stimulate delta waves (associated with deep sleep); effects vary by individual.

Prioritize strategies based on individual needs (e.g., meditation for stress, blue light blocking for late screen use).
