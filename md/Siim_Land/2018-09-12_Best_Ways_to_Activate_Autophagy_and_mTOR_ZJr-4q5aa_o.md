# 2018-09-12 Best Ways to Activate Autophagy and mTOR

## Executive Summary

*   Autophagy, the process of cellular recycling, is a primary driver of longevity, more so than caloric restriction alone. Genetically mutated mice unable to activate autophagy did not live longer, unlike those with functional autophagy genes.
*   The body's fuel sensors, mTOR (anabolic pathway) and AMPK (catabolic pathway), govern growth and cellular repair. Activating AMPK through nutrient deprivation (fasting) triggers autophagy.
*   Balancing mTOR (for muscle maintenance) and autophagy (for cellular recycling) is crucial for longevity. This balance can be achieved through strategic timing of feeding and exercise.
*   Intermittent fasting (e.g., 16-20 hour fasts daily) is an effective way to activate autophagy and achieve longevity benefits without excessive calorie deprivation, especially when combined with high-intensity exercise.
*   Autophagy, particularly mitophagy (mitochondrial recycling), improves mitochondrial function, reduces inflammation, and contributes to a stronger immune system, better cardiovascular health, and prevention of age-related and neurodegenerative diseases.

## Nutrient Sensing and Metabolic Pathways

The body constantly detects the presence of nutrients, which dictates its metabolic processes.
*   **mTOR:** The main anabolic pathway, promoting protein synthesis, cellular growth, and overall anabolic states.
*   **AMPK:** A fuel sensor activated during nutrient deprivation or energy depletion. It triggers catabolic processes.

When the body runs out of internal resources, AMPK activates another metabolic pathway called **autophagy**.
*   **Autophagy:** The process of cellular recycling, where healthy cells search for old and worn-out cells to convert them back into energy. This allows the body to survive longer and obtain energy from unused cells.

This continuous monitoring process involves a balance between growth and repair pathways.

## Caloric Restriction, Intermittent Fasting, and Longevity

Intermittent fasting and caloric restriction are known to prolong lifespan in various species:
*   Yeast: Lifespan can double with reduced calorie intake.
*   Monkeys: Can live 40% longer when fed fewer calories.

While caloric restriction and intermittent fasting share similar benefits, it's crucial to understand their distinct roles. Longevity benefits are primarily linked to **autophagy**, not solely to caloric restriction.

Studies with mice demonstrate this:
*   Mice genetically mutated to be unable to activate autophagy did not live longer, even with caloric restriction.
*   Mice with functional autophagy genes still experienced extended lifespans when subjected to calorie restriction.

Therefore, the key is to activate autophagy, which can be achieved through diligent timing of feeding, allowing for calorie consumption and muscle mass maintenance. Depriving oneself of calories for too long can lead to muscle loss (sarcopenia), which negatively impacts metabolic health and bone strength, ultimately accelerating aging.

## Balancing Autophagy and mTOR

For optimal longevity, it's important to find a balance between activating autophagy and maintaining lean muscle mass via mTOR. The goal is to activate these pathways at specific times to support both longevity and muscle maintenance.

## Practical Strategies: Intermittent Fasting and Exercise

### Intermittent Fasting Protocol

A practical approach to activate autophagy involves daily intermittent fasting, which can also benefit body composition and productivity.

*   **Speaker's Daily Routine:**
    *   Extend fasting window to 18-20 hours daily.
    *   Consume all calories within a 2-4 hour eating window.
*   **Minimum Recommendation for Mild Autophagy:**
    *   Fast for at least 16 hours every day.
*   **Strategy for mTOR Activation:**
    *   Perform resistance training (lifting weights) **before** eating food to direct nutrients towards muscle tissue building and protein synthesis. This helps ensure quality anabolism and muscle gain rather than fat gain.

### Exercise for Insulin Sensitivity and Nutrient Uptake

Even short, intense bursts of exercise can activate GLUT4 receptors, making cells more insulin sensitive and directing circulating glucose into muscle tissue more efficiently.

*   **Minimal Effective Dose for GLUT4 Activation:**
    *   Approximately 90 seconds of resistance training can enhance insulin sensitivity.
*   **General Exercise Protocol (High Intensity, Short Rest):**
    *   Aim for high-intensity exercises with very short rest intervals.
    *   **"Biggest Bang for Your Buck" Exercise:** Burpees (e.g., 100 burpees in 5 minutes with minimal rest).
    *   **Stealthy/Convenient Exercises (e.g., in a restaurant):**
        *   Isometric contractions:
            *   Horse stance (deep squat hold)
            *   Planche (activates shoulder and upper body muscles)
            *   Wall sit

## Health Effects of Autophagy and Mitophagy

Autophagy is intrinsically linked to various aspects of healthy aging and disease prevention:

*   **Immune System:** Stronger immune response, better ability to fight infectious diseases and cancer.
*   **Cardiovascular Function:** Improved cardiovascular health.
*   **Disease Prevention:** Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes and fatty liver disease.
*   **Neurodegenerative Diseases:** Prevention of neurodegenerative issues.
*   **Cellular Health:** Reduced premature cell death, inflammation, and overall aging.

A significant contributor to these benefits is the maintenance of **mitochondrial functioning** through **mitophagy**.

*   **Mitochondrial Functioning:** Mitochondria are the powerhouses of cells. As individuals age, mitochondrial function can decline, leading to various age-related diseases.
*   **Mitophagy:** A specialized form of autophagy that specifically recycles damaged mitochondria, converting them back into energy. This process removes dysfunctional components, reduces inflammation, and provides building blocks for new, healthy mitochondria.

When autophagy is inhibited by poor nutrition habits and nutrient timing, waste accumulates in cells, contributing to inflammation and accelerating aging.

**Mitochondrial Health Process:**

Calorie Restriction + Physical Activity
-> Mitophagy + Mitogenesis
-> Lower Inflammation + Better Stem Cell Function
-> Improved Mitochondrial Function (Enhanced ability to deal with reactive oxygen species/low-level inflammation)
