# 2018-10-10 Snake Diet Fasting Masterclass with Cole Robinson

### Executive Summary

*   **Rapid Weight Loss & Metabolic Healing:** Prolonged fasting (days to weeks) on salt water is highly effective for rapid and sustainable weight loss, particularly for obese individuals. This approach utilizes body fat as the primary fuel source, promotes gut healing, and is observed to reverse Type 2 diabetes by addressing liver and endocrine system dysfunction.
*   **Optimal Blood Sugar Levels:** Mainstream medical guidelines for "healthy" blood sugar (e.g., 3.3-6 mmol/L or 60-110 mg/dL) are often too high. Optimal fasted blood sugar should be in the 3-4 mmol/L range (60-80 mg/dL), and rapid recovery after sugar intake indicates true metabolic health.
*   **Carb Cycling for Performance:** For lean, active individuals, a carb cycling routine combined with fasting optimizes muscle gain, strength, and hormone levels (GH, testosterone). This involves prolonged fasting, zero-carb carnivore days, and strategic carb refeeds to maintain high insulin sensitivity and leverage a dual-fuel metabolic system.
*   **Snake Juice for Electrolyte Balance:** A specific electrolyte mix, "Snake Juice," containing sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and baking soda, is crucial for sustained energy and preventing issues during long fasts, especially by maintaining kidney health and pH balance.
*   **Hormesis and Dietary Adaptability:** While strict zero-carb carnivore diets are excellent for initial healing (e.g., gut issues), long-term avoidance of all plant compounds can lead to hypersensitivity. Incorporating small, infrequent amounts of plant foods leverages hormesis, building tolerance and adaptability, and offering unique phytonutrient benefits.

## Fasting for Weight Loss and Health

*   People are capable of aggressive weight loss if they believe in the method. Fasting for extended periods on salt water can maintain good energy levels, allowing for workouts, especially for obese individuals.
*   Fasting is presented as a prolonged, fasting-focused lifestyle, primarily for overweight individuals, followed by an eating routine of at most one meal a day or 48-hour fasts once weight is reduced.
*   **Benefits of Fasting:**
    *   Significantly increases growth hormone.
    *   Induces autophagy (cellular cleaning).
    *   Cleanses the system, leading to various health benefits.
    *   Utilizes body fat as pure fuel, akin to a hibernating grizzly bear.

### Snake Diet Protocol (for Obese Individuals)

1.  **Initial Phase (Confidence Building):** Start with a 72-hour fast on Snake Juice.
2.  **Extended Fasting:** If feeling good after 72 hours, continue fasting for 96 hours, or as long as tolerable ("until you feel like death").
3.  **Refeed:** Consume a small, zero-carb meal (a "pit stop").
4.  **Repeat:** Cycle through prolonged fasts and refeeds.
5.  **Minimum Routine for Obese:** A 72-hour fasting routine with at most 500-calorie, zero-carb refeeds can lead to a minimum of 20 pounds of weight loss per month for women, and potentially more for men.
6.  **Very Obese Individuals:** Can safely fast for 7+ days, especially if sedentary, as their stored body fat contains ample electrolytes.

*   **Addressing Mainstream Fears:** Many people fear fasting due to widespread misinformation, which is often commercially driven. Fasting does not "kill" people and is a natural, evolutionarily adapted process.
*   **Weight Loss and Motivation:** Rapid weight loss through fasting is a significant motivator, helping individuals adhere to the routine.

## Optimal Blood Sugar and Metabolic Health

*   **Thyroid Hormones:** Blood test results indicating slightly low T3 hormone should be secondary to how an individual feels. If feeling "great" after significant weight loss, minor deviations from reference ranges may not be clinically significant.
*   **Misconceptions of Healthy Blood Sugar Ranges:**
    *   Mainstream healthy blood sugar ranges (e.g., 3.3-6 mmol/L or 60-110 mg/dL in Alberta, Canada) are considered too high.
    *   Blood sugar consistently over 5 mmol/L (90 mg/dL) indicates potential fatty liver and pre-diabetic states.
*   **Indicators of True Metabolic Health:**
    *   **Recovery Time:** A healthy individual can rapidly recover normal blood sugar levels after a high sugar intake (e.g., from 10 mmol/L to 4.4 mmol/L within an hour).
    *   **Fasted Blood Sugar (12 hours, not in ketosis):** Should be in the 4s mmol/L. Levels above 5 mmol/L suggest metabolic issues requiring fasting and healing.
    *   **Fasted Blood Sugar (in ketosis):** Should be in the 3s mmol/L.
*   **Medical System Critique:** Doctors are often seen as uninformed on metabolic health, especially the endocrine system, and tend to over-prescribe medications based on overly broad reference ranges, leading to unnecessary drug reliance.

### Type 2 Diabetes Reversal through Fasting

*   Type 2 diabetes is considered a condition primarily caused by excessive body fat and a dysregulated endocrine system.
*   **Protocol:**
    1.  **Stop Eating:** Initiate prolonged fasting to heal the liver.
    2.  **Ketosis:** Blood sugar will clear as ketosis is achieved (typically 48 hours for healthy individuals, but 2-4 days for Type 2 diabetics).
    3.  **Low Blood Sugar Maintenance:** Keep blood sugar as low as possible.
    4.  **Zero-Carb Refeeds:** Consume zero-carb meals during refeeding periods (every 3-7 days) to avoid blood sugar spikes and allow continued healing.

## The Snake Juice Protocol

*   **Purpose:** Provides essential electrolytes (sodium, potassium) during prolonged fasts to maintain energy and prevent deficiency symptoms (e.g., fainting during exercise).
*   **Initial Discovery:** An 8-day fast on a salt water mix was crucial in understanding its benefits for sustained energy and workout capacity during fasting. Obese individuals, with more stored body fat, naturally have more entrained electrolytes, aiding longer fasts.

### Snake Juice Recipe

*   **Original (More Concentrated):**
    *   1 teaspoon Sodium Chloride (Himalayan pink salt/sea salt) per 1 liter of water.
    *   1 teaspoon Potassium Chloride (e.g., No Salt, salt-free brands) per 1 liter of water.
*   **Updated (Lighter Dosage, with Baking Soda):**
    *   1 teaspoon Potassium Chloride per 2 liters of water.
    *   ½ teaspoon Sodium Chloride per 2 liters of water.
    *   1 teaspoon Baking Soda (Sodium Bicarbonate) per 2 liters of water.
*   **Benefit of Baking Soda:**
    *   Helps maintain pH balance in urine and kidneys during prolonged deep ketosis, which can cause kidneys to become acidic.
    *   Acts preventatively against kidney stone formation and helps break down existing sediment, alleviating kidney pain during fasting.

## Dry Fasting

*   **Concept:** Abstaining from both food and water.
*   **Aggressiveness:** More aggressive for weight loss and detoxification than water fasting.
*   **Metabolic Water Production:** A deep dry-fasted state stimulates the body to produce metabolic water from fat stores (similar to a camel), enhancing "water adaptation." This allows for quicker entry into fat-burning mode when the body senses a lack of exogenous water.
*   **Duration:** Can only be sustained for shorter periods than water fasts (e.g., 5-7 days for an individual with sufficient body fat).
*   **Cycling:** For very long fasts, cycling between dry fasting (as long as tolerable) and hydrating with Snake Juice is recommended.
*   **Initial Adaptation:** First dry fasts may induce severe headaches (e.g., at 48 hours) as the body shifts to metabolic water production, similar to the "hunger phase" during the transition to ketosis.

## Carnivore Diet and Hormesis

*   **Carnivore for Healing:** A strict zero-carb carnivore diet, especially combined with fasting, is effective for healing gut issues (e.g., from excessive coffee or antibiotics) and severe metabolic problems.
*   **Hormesis Explained:**
    *   Complex biological processes can be visualized as:
        *   **Baseline State** -> **Mild Stressor (e.g., small plant intake)** -> **Adaptive Response (Hormesis)** -> **Improved Tolerance/Resilience**
    *   Plants contain phytonutrients and anti-nutrients that, in small doses, can act like "medication," challenging the body and stimulating adaptive responses.
*   **Long-Term Strict Carnivore Risks:**
    *   Hypersensitivity to plant compounds.
    *   Reduced adaptability to various dietary inputs.
    *   Historical examples (e.g., Inuit) show occasional consumption of berries, suggesting a natural drive for hormetic effects.
*   **Recommendation:** After initial healing on a strict carnivore diet, gradually reintroduce small, infrequent amounts of plants (e.g., every couple of days) to build tolerance, enhance adaptability, and gain additional longevity benefits from phytonutrients (e.g., sulforaphane).

## Carb Cycling for Performance and Lean Maintenance

*   **Principle:** A protocol for lean individuals focusing on combining fasting with specific zero-carb and carb refeed days.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Maintains highly stable blood sugar and insulin sensitivity.
    *   Maximizes growth hormone and testosterone production.
    *   Allows effective "pounding" of nutrients during refeeds due to heightened insulin sensitivity, leading to better muscle gains and explosive performance.
    *   **Dual Fuel System in Action:**
        *   **Fasted (Ketosis + Glycogen Stores):** Low-intensity activity (e.g., walking) primarily burns body fat.
        *   **Anaerobic Activity (Glycogen Access):** High-intensity bursts (e.g., sprints) utilize readily available muscle glycogen.
*   **Performance Differences (Carnivore vs. Carb Cycling):**
    *   Strict zero-carb carnivore can lead to feelings of flatness and reduced explosive strength in the gym, hindering optimal muscle gain.
    *   Carb cycling provides the necessary glycogen for peak performance and strength gains.

### Carb Cycling Protocol for Overweight Athletes

1.  **Fasting Frequency:** No more than 24-hour fasts.
2.  **Carb Loading:** Typically on weekends and Wednesday nights.
3.  **Aggressive Cutting Day:** Tuesday is ideal for aggressive calorie reduction. Since the individual is in ketosis and it's a zero-carb refeed day, calories can be significantly cut (e.g., hitting only protein target, minimizing fat).

### Current Personal Routine (Maintaining/Building Muscle)

*   **Weekend Carb-Up (Saturday & Sunday):**
    *   One meal a day, eaten at night.
    *   Foods: Sweet potato, rice, lean cuts of steak (1-1.5 grams protein per pound body weight). Minimal fat.
    *   Hydration: Drink plenty of water.
*   **Zero-Carb Days (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday):**
    *   One meal a day, eaten at night (carnivore).
    *   Fasting: Dry fast throughout the day, hydrating only if intense gym activity necessitates it.
    *   **Tuesday:** Can be a lower-calorie day (e.g., ~2000 calories) by cutting fat to aggressively reduce calories while hitting protein targets.
*   **Mid-Week Carb-Up (Wednesday):**
    *   One meal a day, eaten at night.
    *   Carbohydrates: Approximately 300 grams (less aggressive than weekend).
    *   Foods: Lean meat, minimal fat (e.g., steak with only inherent fat).
    *   Fasting: Dry fast during the day, training fasted.
*   **Training Schedule:** Upper/lower split, 6 times a week. Sunday is a rest day. Carb-up days are timed around heavy training.
*   **Eating on a Dry Stomach:** Always eat the meal on a dry stomach and avoid drinking water for 1-2 hours afterward. This optimizes stomach acidity (high HCl levels) for better food digestion.

### Optimal Refeed Strategy for Hard Cutting

*   **Food Choice:** Raw liver is highly recommended due to its low calorie count, high nutrient density, and rich cholesterol content.
*   **Other Options:** Raw eggs.
*   **Benefits:** Provides essential micronutrients and protein with minimal calories, maintaining ketosis and satiety.

## Gut Health and Absorption

*   **Central Role:** Gut health is paramount for overall well-being and is directly linked to mental health ("happy gut, healthy mind").
*   **Absorption Matters:** The body's ability to absorb nutrients is more crucial than the quantity of food consumed.
*   **Signs of Poor Gut Health:** Frequent bowel movements (e.g., four times a day) indicate malabsorption, explaining why some individuals struggle to gain weight despite high caloric intake.
*   **Traditional Methods:** Eskimos historically consumed "high meat" (fermented, rotten meat) to obtain a potent natural probiotic effect, boosting energy and health, demonstrating the critical influence of the gut microbiome.
*   **Coffee:** Not recommended due to its addictive potential and negative impact on gut health.

## Cholesterol and Inflammation

*   **Cholesterol during Fasting:**
    *   Cholesterol levels may temporarily rise during prolonged fasting, as the body mobilizes and breaks down stored body fat. This is a natural physiological process and not necessarily indicative of unhealthy cholesterol.
*   **True Concerns with High Cholesterol:** Elevated cholesterol, particularly alongside high triglycerides, in individuals consuming processed foods, bread, and sugar, is a sign of metabolic dysfunction and systemic inflammation. The issue is the underlying diet and lifestyle, not cholesterol itself.
*   **Inflammation Pathway:**
    *   **High Sugar Intake** -> **Chronically Elevated Blood Sugar** -> **Increased Insulin Production (constantly high)** -> **Systemic Inflammation (especially in arteries)** -> **Atherosclerosis/Other Health Issues**
*   **Fasting's Impact on Inflammation:** Fasting significantly lowers insulin levels to rock bottom, thereby reducing systemic inflammation.

### Reversing Type 1 Diabetes

*   Type 1 diabetes, often triggered by autoimmune issues following stress, is characterized by the immune system attacking pancreatic beta cells.
*   **Mainstream Approach (Critique):** Diagnosis often leads to immediate insulin prescription, which can be detrimental by further elevating insulin levels in an already struggling system.
*   **Fasting Intervention:** Fasting can potentially reverse Type 1 diabetes by dramatically reducing insulin demand and allowing the pancreas to heal or recover some function. Documented cases show individuals diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes coming off insulin within a week using fasting protocols.

## Obesity Epidemic and Systemic Issues

*   **The System's Role:** The mainstream medical and fitness industries are often driven by profit, perpetuating ineffective or harmful dietary advice and creating fear around natural health practices like fasting.
*   **Worst Weight Loss Strategy:** Trying to lose weight through calorie restriction, high-frequency eating, and high-carb diets is the most catabolic and least effective method. This approach is only sustainable for individuals using performance-enhancing drugs.
*   **Fasting as the Solution:** "Caloric stoppage" (fasting) is presented as the most effective and natural solution for weight loss and health recovery.
*   **Critique of Veganism:** Vegan diets are argued to be significantly less healthy than even a carnivore diet based on factory-farmed meat, especially when combined with fasting. Studies on meat consumption are often flawed by not isolating meat from other unhealthy dietary components.

### Natural vs. Enhanced Bodybuilding

*   **Natural Potential:** A fasting-focused lifestyle with one meal a day can allow natural bodybuilders to reach their genetic potential for muscle mass and strength due to optimized hormone levels (GH, testosterone) and insulin sensitivity.
*   **Enhanced Performance:** Athletes using performance-enhancing drugs require constant anabolic states, multiple high-calorie meals, and high insulin levels to support their unnatural muscle mass, making a strict fasting regimen incompatible with their goals. This comes at the cost of health.
*   **Anabolic Effects of Fasting (Natural):** For natural individuals, fasting actually leads to greater long-term anabolic effects due to sustained high insulin sensitivity and elevated GH/testosterone.

## Key Advice for a Fat Loss Journey

*   **Accountability through Visuals:**
    *   Take "wicked" starting pictures.
    *   Take progress pictures every seven days.
    *   Compare only against personal past results, not idealized social media images.
*   **Overcome Fear of Judgment:**
    *   Inform your social circle about your fasting routine.
    *   Be assertive in protecting your lifestyle choices from external criticism or pressure.
*   **Simplicity of Weight Loss:** The core principle of weight loss is to "stop eating and drink salt water."
*   **Helping Others:** Coaching is offered for free, with the main "payment" being accountability pictures posted in a large online community. This social accountability is a powerful motivator for adherence and results.
*   **The Mission:** To solve the obesity epidemic by promoting fearless fasting, reduce reliance on big pharma, and empower individuals to take control of their health.
