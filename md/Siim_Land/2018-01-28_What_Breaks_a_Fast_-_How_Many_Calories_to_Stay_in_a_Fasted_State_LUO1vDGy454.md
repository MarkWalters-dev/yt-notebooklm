# 2018-01-28 What Breaks a Fast - How Many Calories to Stay in a Fasted State

### Executive Summary

*   Fasting benefits primarily stem from Autophagy (cellular recycling), Ketosis (fat burning), and Hormesis (adaptive stress response).
*   Autophagy is inhibited by mTOR, which is highly sensitive to nutrients like carbohydrates and protein, even small amounts (e.g., 50 calories or 2-3g Leucine).
*   Ketosis is initiated when liver glycogen stores are depleted, typically taking 16-20 hours.
*   While fat doesn't significantly raise insulin, consuming too much fat or exogenous ketones can signal nutrient abundance, potentially raising mTOR and inhibiting autophagy if blood glucose is high.
*   Certain compounds like green tea, ginger, turmeric, and small amounts of MCT oil can strategically boost autophagy during a fast.

## The Mechanisms of Fasting

Fasting offers benefits such as fat loss, reduced inflammation, promotion of longevity, strengthened immune system, and boosted muscle growth. These benefits are largely driven by three key physiological processes:

1.  **Autophagy:** The cell's self-digestive mechanism that recycles waste material and old proteins into energy, improving health and longevity.
2.  **Ketosis:** A metabolic state characterized by elevated ketone bodies in the bloodstream, leading to the primary use of fat for fuel from adipose tissue. Ketones are a superior energy source for the brain, causing less oxidative stress and providing sustained energy.
3.  **Hormesis:** The body's adaptive response to mild stress, triggering protective metabolic pathways like AMPK, which increase mitochondrial density and boost the immune system.

The primary triggers for these benefits are energy deficit and glycogen depletion.

### Ketosis

Liver glycogen stores must be depleted for the liver to start producing ketone bodies. This process typically takes about 16 to 20 hours.

### Autophagy & Hormesis

*   **Autophagy** requires the inhibition of mTOR (mechanistic Target of Rapamycin), the body's most anabolic metabolic pathway that promotes cell growth. AMPK supports autophagy during energy deprivation.
*   Mild autophagy can occur with the suppression of mTOR by keeping insulin and blood sugar very low.
*   For significant cellular cleaning, fasting for at least 24 to 48 hours is needed.
*   **AMPK** (AMP-activated protein kinase) is triggered when the body needs to generate energy in a fuel-deprived state.
*   Fasting and glycogen depletion induce a caloric deficit, activating the body's adaptation mechanisms.
*   Exercise or cold exposure can also upregulate AMPK and mitochondrial biogenesis.

## What Breaks a Fast: Autophagy Inhibition

The main inhibitor of autophagy is mTOR. mTOR responds to nutrient availability, deactivating autophagy when nutrients are plentiful. Autophagy and mTOR are opposing processes: catabolism and anabolism.

*   **Carbohydrates and Protein:** These are potent activators of mTOR.
*   **Small Caloric Intake:** Eating as little as 50 calories, or even 2-3 grams of Leucine, can cause an anabolic response that shifts the body out of a fasted state and inhibits autophagy. BCAAs (branched-chain amino acids) are also nutrient-rich and will likely elevate mTOR, halting autophagy.
*   **Fat:** Fat generally does not raise insulin and can keep mTOR suppressed in small amounts. Endogenous ketone bodies from body fat can stimulate autophagy, including brain macroautophagy.
    *   **Exogenous Ketones:** In some cases, exogenous ketones can promote insulin secretion, especially if blood glucose levels are above 5.0 mmol/L (90 mg/dL). For individuals with higher body fat, the presence of stored energy signals nutrient abundance, which can raise mTOR and suppress autophagy.
    *   To be completely safe for autophagy, avoiding all calories from fats, bulletproof coffee, or exogenous ketones is recommended.

## Strategies to Boost Autophagy While Fasting

While avoiding all calories is safest for maximum autophagy, certain compounds can stimulate it:

*   **Green Tea:** Contains polyphenols and EGCG, which stimulate autophagy.
*   **Coconut Oil/MCT Oil:** In very small amounts (no more than one teaspoon), these can stimulate autophagy by raising ketones. However, excess fat/energy can still elevate mTOR.
*   **Ginger:** The compound 6-shogaol can block mTOR, activating autophagy.
*   **Ginseng:** Shown to induce autophagy.
*   **Turmeric/Curcumin:** Induces autophagy, but being fat-soluble, it requires a small amount of fat for absorption (e.g., combined with one teaspoon of MCT oil).
*   **Galangal:** This Southeast Asian spice has been shown to induce autophagy.
*   **Reishi Mushroom Extracts:** Increase autophagy and inhibit certain cancer growths.
*   **Coffee:** Stimulates lipid metabolism through the autophagy-lysosomal pathway in mice. However, excessive caffeine consumption may lead to higher blood glucose and insulin levels.
*   **Apple Cider Vinegar:** Contains trace micronutrients and is unlikely to break a fast. It may boost autophagy by promoting cleaning processes and ketosis.
*   **Water and Salt:** For electrolyte balance and to ensure complete fasting.

## Artificial Sweeteners and Fasting

Research on artificial sweeteners is contradictory. A recent review on low-calorie sweeteners suggested no significant effects on insulin *in vivo*. However, individual responses vary based on insulin sensitivity. Even if they don't spike insulin, artificial sweeteners may still inhibit autophagy and have negative effects on the microbiome. For these reasons, complete avoidance is generally recommended.

## Fasting Goals and Caloric Intake

The definition of "breaking a fast" depends on the specific fasting goal (e.g., religious, fat loss, longevity, convenience).

*   **Fasting for Fat Loss:** The primary goal is to maintain a caloric deficit and boost ketosis, potentially stimulating some autophagy. Foods like bulletproof coffee, while delicious, are still calories and will impact the caloric deficit.
*   **Fasting for Autophagy:** To maximize autophagy benefits, a minimum of 24 hours of fasting is generally required. Consuming external calories signals nutrient availability, potentially inhibiting this process.
*   **Shorter Fasts (16-20 hours):** For those fasting for shorter durations, incorporating autophagy-boosting compounds like green tea, coffee, turmeric, and ginger can help enhance the benefits and support a caloric deficit.
