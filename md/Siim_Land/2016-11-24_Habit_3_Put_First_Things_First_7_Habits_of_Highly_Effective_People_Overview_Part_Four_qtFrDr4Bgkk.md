# 2016-11-24 Habit 3 Put First Things First 7 Habits of Highly Effective People Overview Part Four

### Executive Summary

*   Habit 3, "Put First Things First," is the physical manifestation and actualization of personal leadership, translating envisioned goals into daily actions.
*   Effective self-management hinges on prioritizing activities based on importance, not just urgency.
*   Activities are categorized into a four-quadrant time management matrix: Urgent & Important (Q1), Not Urgent & Important (Q2), Urgent & Not Important (Q3), and Not Urgent & Not Important (Q4).
*   Quadrant Two (Not Urgent, Important) is the optimal zone for proactivity, planning, and achieving significant goals without stress.
*   Prioritization involves having the courage to say 'no' to less important activities and leveraging principles like Pareto's 80/20 rule to focus on high-impact tasks.

## Introduction to Habit 3

Habit 3, "Put First Things First," is described as the "second creation." If Habit 2 (beginning with the end in mind) is the ability to envision potential, then Habit 3 is its physical manifestation—the real-world embodiment and actualization of one's character on a daily, moment-by-moment basis. While personal leadership is about beginning with the end in mind, effective self-management begins with putting first things first. This habit primarily addresses questions of time and life management.

## The Four-Quadrant Time Management Matrix

All activities can be categorized under two factors: urgent and important. This creates a four-quadrant matrix for time management, offering appropriate responses for any situation:

*   **Quadrant One (Urgent and Important):** Activities such as crises, deadlines, and pressing problems.
*   **Quadrant Two (Not Urgent but Important):** Activities such as planning, networking, and seeking new opportunities.
*   **Quadrant Three (Urgent but Not Important):** Activities such as distractions, interruptions, and meetings.
*   **Quadrant Four (Not Urgent and Not Important):** Activities such as procrastination, time wasting, and seeking maximum pleasure without purpose.

## The Power of Quadrant Two

A reactive person tends to do only what is urgent, acting primarily when problems have already escalated. They also procrastinate and engage in activities that are neither important nor effective. Being busy does not equate to being productive or contributing towards desired achievements.

The most effective place to operate from is Quadrant Two. This is considered the "sweet spot" where individuals can avoid the stress of pushing deadlines or constantly addressing immediate problems. This realm fosters proactivity, allowing one to freely engage in what matters most without feeling rushed.

To effectively reside in Quadrant Two, it is essential to learn to decline other activities, even those that may seem urgent. This requires deciding on one's highest priorities and possessing the courage to reject other demands. A deeper, burning "yes" towards one's purpose should guide these decisions.

## Prioritization Strategies

To determine what is most important and effectively manage time, several strategies can be employed:

*   **Pareto's Principle (80/20 Rule):** Identify the 20% of activities that will yield 80% of the results. Focusing on these high-impact activities maximizes productivity.
*   **Via Negativa:** Systematically remove non-essential elements from one's life. This process can be applied to material possessions, habits, and even relationships or energy drains.

The core paradigm for Quadrant Two effectiveness involves viewing everything through the lens of importance and avoiding distraction by tasks that merely seem urgent. While Quadrant Two emphasizes "not urgent," it can be beneficial to introduce a degree of self-imposed urgency into what you do, as it can motivate action and make life more engaging.

## Action Steps for Effective Self-Management

To accomplish purposes aligned with core values by putting first things first, follow a Quadrant Two meta-focus:

1.  **Identify and Commit:** Pinpoint a significant Quadrant Two activity that has been neglected but is highly important. Write it down and commit to engaging with it.
2.  **Estimate Time Allocation:** Create your own time management matrix and estimate the percentage of your time currently spent in each of the four quadrants.
3.  **Log and Evaluate Time:** Log your actual time for three days. Compare this log with your estimate. Assess your satisfaction with how you spend your time and analyze the actual amount of time spent in Quadrant One, Two, Three, and Four.
