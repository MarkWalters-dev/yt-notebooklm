# 2019-05-19 10 Things I Wish I Knew About Intermittent Fasting Sooner

## Executive Summary

*   Achieving fat adaptation and ketosis quickly is vital during fasting to protect muscle and enable autophagy. Eating low-carb keto before longer fasts can help.
*   Electrolyte balance is critical; deficiencies (especially sodium, magnesium) cause lethargy during fasting, and pure water fasting can dangerously flush minerals.
*   Autophagy, while beneficial, can be overactivated leading to negative side effects like cancer proliferation, muscle loss, and insulin issues. It should be cycled with periods of feasting.
*   Shorter, more frequent fasts (e.g., 48-hour fasts weekly/bi-weekly, or 3-day fasts quarterly) yield greater cumulative fasting days and health benefits than very infrequent, super-long fasts.
*   Fasting durations like 16:8 are generally insufficient to achieve significant ketosis and autophagy, which typically require burning through endogenous nutrients for over 24 hours.

## 1. Get Fat Adapted

It's critical to get into ketosis as soon as possible when fasting to protect against muscle metabolism and maintain autophagy. Your body carries thousands of calories; the challenge is accessing them. To prepare for longer fasts, consume a low-carb keto diet beforehand.

## 2. Pay Attention to Electrolytes

Electrolytes are vital for life and energy production. Lethargy during fasting is often due to mineral deficiency, not lack of food.
*   **Key Electrolytes:** Sodium (from quality sea salt or pink salt), magnesium, and other minerals.
*   **Caution:** Regular water fasting with only pure water can be dangerous, as it can flush out essential electrolytes. Drink water to stay hydrated, but avoid overdoing it.

## 3. No Need to Kill Yourself with Workouts

During fasting, the body already experiences higher muscle stress and is more prone to catabolism. There's limited evidence that fasted training significantly improves benefits compared to fed training. While some extra fat might be burned, the resistance training response is similar. To trigger positive hormonal adaptations and fat burning, a maintenance-type workout while fasting for longer durations is often sufficient, negating the need for extensive weightlifting, HIIT, and cardio sessions.

## 4. Too Much Autophagy Isn't Good

While often lauded for benefits like cancer prevention, stem cell boosting, and longevity, autophagy overactivation has negative side effects:
*   Proliferation of cancer cells
*   Tumor metastases
*   Muscle loss
*   Insulin regulation problems

It's crucial to cycle autophagy with periods of fasting and feasting to ensure adequate anabolism and nutrient intake, rather than constantly activating it.

## 5. Short But More Frequent Fasts Are Better Than Super Long Fasts

An "all or nothing" approach to fasting (e.g., bingeing, then fasting for several days) is unsustainable and not optimal. More frequent, shorter fasts often lead to more cumulative fasting days and greater health benefits.

**Fasting Duration Comparison:**
*   **10-day fast once a year:** 10 days of fasting per year.
*   **3-day fast every quarter:** 12 days of fasting per year.
*   **48-hour fast every week or two:** 30-50 days of fasting per year.

While 2-3 day fasts might be needed to significantly activate autophagy, these cannot be done frequently. It's better to have more frequent shorter fasts to increase basal autophagy, supplemented with a few longer fasts a few times a year.

## 6. Fasting for 16:8 Isn't Probably Enough for Autophagy

Many beginners start with 16:8 fasting aiming for autophagy benefits, but this duration is often insufficient.
*   **Metabolic Pathway to Autophagy:**
    Burn Endogenous Nutrients (Glycogen) -> Enter Ketosis & Autophagy
*   This process typically takes longer than 24 hours.
*   Even if autophagy is briefly activated with 16:8, breaking the fast immediately inhibits it.
*   Eating less frequently, such as with one meal a day (OMAD), is generally more effective for achieving a fasted state and basal autophagy.

## 7. It's Better to Have Some Breaks From Fasting

While consistent fasting (e.g., OMAD) can be beneficial, incorporating days with a longer eating window is advisable. From a circadian rhythm perspective, consuming food within 10 hours or less is optimal; ideally, within 4-6 hours. For example, most days eating OMAD within 1-2 hours, and occasionally (every week or two) extending the eating window to 4-6 hours to include two meals.

## 8. Eat for Nutrient Density

When fasting frequently, it's crucial to ensure your body receives essential nutrients, as many people are already deficient. Meals should be highly nutrient-dense, especially given a limited eating window.

**Examples of Highly Nutritious Foods:**
*   Organ meats
*   Egg yolks
*   Fatty fish
*   Tubers
*   Meat
*   Vegetables
*   Nuts

Avoid processed foods and empty calories.

## 9. Being Too Tough Isn't Optimal

Fasting is a physiological stressor that drives hormetic adaptation. As you become more fat-adapted, fasting gets easier. However, if your metabolism becomes too tough and resilient, you'll need longer or harder fasts to achieve the same effects. While this builds survival resilience, it's not sustainable for continuous fat loss and longevity in a modern environment. The goal should be to maximize effects with less effort, necessitating a varied approach to fasting.

## 10. Not Prioritizing Training Enough

Exercise remains a critical component of health, potentially more so than fasting alone. Fasting is just one part of the health equation. If fasting negatively impacts your training progress or consistency, its benefits may be outweighed. Prioritizing resistance training and general exercise often leads to overall health improvements. Combining both fasting and consistent training is essential to reach full health potential.
