# 2019-07-11 Benefits of Carb Cycling and Intermittent Fasting with Matt Gallant

## Executive Summary

*   Inflammatory foods, particularly certain fats and proteins, are more detrimental to health than sugar, though excessive sugar consumption can also be inflammatory.
*   Proteolytic enzymes, when taken on an empty stomach, can enter the bloodstream and help break down accumulated undigested proteins, potentially reducing inflammatory and allergic responses.
*   Cyclical ketogenic diets, involving periods of low carbohydrate intake followed by carb-loading, can be highly anabolic, particularly for muscle building, by strategically utilizing insulin's anabolic properties.
*   Intermittent fasting, especially prolonged fasts, can free up significant mental energy by reducing the constant focus on food preparation and consumption, leading to a profound shift in one's nervous system and a sense of empowerment.
*   Individual dietary needs are influenced by genetic and ancestral factors, as well as early childhood dietary patterns, impacting how the body metabolizes various nutrients and responds to different foods.

## Understanding Inflammatory Foods

*   The primary concern regarding diet is the avoidance of inflammatory foods.
*   While sugar can be inflammatory, particularly when abused, certain fats and proteins are significantly more inflammatory.
*   **A1 protein** found in most cow's milk dairy products is a common source of inflammation for many individuals. Transitioning to A2 protein from sheep and goat dairy can alleviate issues for those who believe they are lactose intolerant.
*   Inflammatory fats, such as those found in vegetable oils and rancid fats, pose a greater threat to health than sugar.
*   Inflammation can significantly hinder fat loss. Reducing inflammation by eliminating bad fats and cleaning up protein sources can make fat loss substantially easier.
*   Even during carb-loading or refeed days, being mindful of inflammatory food choices is crucial, as the inflammation can persist for an entire week, unlike the transient effects of carbohydrates.

## Carb Cycling and Cyclical Ketogenic Diets

*   The **Anabolic Diet**, a form of cyclical keto, involves 5-6 days of ketogenic eating followed by one day of carb loading, which is beneficial for muscle building.
*   This approach has historical roots, with bodybuilders like Vince Gironda employing cyclical diets decades ago.
*   The core principle is to strategically stress the body with high calories and carbohydrates to elevate insulin and growth hormone, promoting an anabolic response for muscle growth.
*   The "Cycle Diet" by Scott Abel advocates for a 6-day calorie deficit followed by a 1-day massive calorie intake, a strategy to maintain leanness and muscle mass while preventing metabolic slowdown.
*   Chronic calorie restriction can lead to a slower metabolism and potential muscle catabolism.
*   **Matt Gallant's personal approach (One Meal a Day - OMAD with Cyclical Keto):**
    *   **Monday-Thursday:** One ketogenic meal per day, often carnivore-like (e.g., ribeye, salmon with veggies, ground lamb with goat cheese, large salad). Workouts typically occur at 4 PM, followed by the meal at 6 PM.
    *   **Thursday Night to Sunday Morning:** Approximately a 60-hour fast, aiming for autophagy and calorie deficit for fat loss (around 1 pound of fat loss per week).
    *   **Sunday:** A massive calorie and carbohydrate day.
        *   When depleted of carbs, they are preferentially shuttled into muscles, especially with increased muscle mass, rather than converted to fat via gluconeogenesis.
        *   Insulin, a highly anabolic hormone, rises significantly due to the carb load and heightened insulin sensitivity from fasting and keto.
        *   The stress of a high-calorie day can increase growth hormone.
        *   Provides psychological benefits, allowing for enjoyment of desired foods at restaurants.
        *   Helps crank up leptin levels, supporting metabolism and preventing metabolic slowdown.
*   **Benefits of this extreme approach for Matt:**
    *   Continuous lean muscle mass gain (4-8 pounds per year).
    *   Gradual fat loss (4-8 pounds per year).
    *   Maximum health and energy.
    *   Keto benefits.
    *   Autophagy from extended fasting.
    *   Muscle building effects from carb load days.

## Intermittent Fasting (IF)

*   **Primary Benefit:** Frees up significant mental energy by reducing time spent thinking about, preparing, eating, and cleaning up food.
*   **Overcoming Biological Response:** The struggle with fasting often stems from not overcoming the primal biological response that signals a need to feed to survive. This is primarily driven by ghrelin, a hunger hormone, which can be an illusion as humans can survive prolonged periods without food.
*   **Empowerment and Resilience:** Successfully completing multi-day fasts can be profoundly empowering, demonstrating that one is safe even when not eating. This shifts the nervous system and builds resilience.
*   **Relationship with Food:** Fasting helps differentiate between psychological hunger, physiological cravings, and eating out of boredom.
*   **Historical Context:** The human body is naturally designed to alternate between periods of fasting and feasting, mirroring ancestral patterns of food availability.

## Epigenetics, Ancestry, and Diet

*   **Epigenetics:** Environmental factors (diet, emotions) can turn genes on or off, and these changes can be passed down through generations (up to 18 generations observed in worms).
*   **Ancestral Genetics:** Our genetic makeup, influenced by ancestral climate and diet, affects how we metabolize nutrients. For example, individuals with Northern European genetics may be better adapted to high-fat diets, while those from tropical climates with year-round fruit availability may metabolize carbohydrates differently.
*   **Mediterranean Genetics:** People with Mediterranean genetics, accustomed to year-round food abundance, may not tolerate fasting as well, and it can be a stressor, leading to decreased Heart Rate Variability (HRV).
*   **Personal Response:** Individual responses to fasting can vary; for some, like Matt, fasting increases HRV and lowers heart rate, indicating it's beneficial.
*   **Seasonal Eating:** Eating foods out of season can impact gene expression (e.g., BMAL1 and CRY1) and may not be processed as efficiently by the body, potentially leading to increased fat gain.

## The Role of Gut Biome and Childhood Diet

*   **Gut Biome Development:** Early childhood diet is a primary factor in colonizing and shaping the gut microbiome.
*   **Individual Tolerance:** What one ate as a child can strongly influence their ability to digest specific foods later in life. For instance, someone who didn't grow up with rice may have difficulty digesting it, while someone who grew up with potatoes might tolerate them well.
*   **Glycemic Response:** Gut bacteria play a significant role in how food is broken down, leading to varied glycemic responses to the same foods among different individuals, irrespective of their theoretical glycemic index.
*   **Personalized Nutrition:** Gut biome testing can provide recommendations for foods to emphasize and avoid based on an individual's microbiome.
*   **Example:** Matt's gut biome allows him to consume large salads with specific greens (watercress, arugula) without weight gain or significant digestive output, as his body efficiently processes these foods.
*   **Sugar Tolerance:** A childhood diet rich in cereal and ramen noodles may contribute to a gut biome capable of efficiently processing sugar, leading to a lower blood sugar response even with high sugar intake. This can be a factor in why some individuals, like Matt, have a strong sweet tooth and can consume significant sugar on carb-load days without immediate negative effects.

## Enzymes and Digestive Optimization

*   **Enzymes as "Workers":** Enzymes are crucial for breaking down food (disassembling) and then rebuilding components for bodily needs. They perform thousands of functions, from thinking to blinking.
*   **Protein Digestion:** Proteolytic enzymes break down proteins into amino acids. A deficiency in enzymes like DPP-4 can prevent the breakdown of gluten, leading to inflammation.
*   **Nutrient Assimilation:** Enzymes help transport nutrients through the intestinal tract and aid in rebuilding tissues.
*   **Specific Enzyme Products Mentioned:**
    *   **MassZymes:** High protease content for protein breakdown, beneficial for vegetarians to ensure adequate amino acid absorption and muscle preservation. Taking on an empty stomach can help break down accumulated undigested proteins in the bloodstream.
    *   **Gluten Guardian:** Contains DPP-4 to aid in gluten digestion, recommended for refeed days or consumption of gluten-containing foods.
    *   **CapEx:** Formulated for keto, paleo, and low-carb diets. Contains lipases for fat digestion, HCL and dandelion root to stimulate bile, and ingredients like L-carnitine and InnoSlim to help transport and break down fatty acids for energy. It's noted as a powerful, non-nervous system stimulating energy booster.
*   **Benefits of Enzymes:**
    *   **Improved Digestion:** Aids in breaking down complex foods.
    *   **Nutrient Absorption:** Enhances the body's ability to utilize nutrients.
    *   **Reduced Inflammation:** Helps prevent undigested proteins from causing inflammatory or allergic reactions.
    *   **Anti-Aging:** Preserves the body's own enzyme reserves, which decline with age.
    *   **Enhanced Recovery:** Proteolytic enzymes can double recovery speed in athletes.
    *   **Muscle Growth:** Sipping a protein drink mixed with enzymes during workouts provides a predigested amino acid source for immediate muscle repair and growth.
    *   **Tenderizing Meat:** MassZymes can be used to tenderize less-than-ideal cuts of meat.
*   **When to Take Enzymes:**
    *   **With Meals:** To aid digestion and nutrient breakdown.
    *   **On an Empty Stomach (Fasted State):** To target and break down undigested proteins in the bloodstream, potentially accelerating autophagy and supporting the body's natural healing processes.
    *   **Before Bed:** Can improve sleep quality by aiding digestion and reducing the metabolic load on the body overnight.

## Testing for Optimal Diet

*   **Cyrex Labs:** Recommended for food allergy and sensitivity testing.
*   **Biofeedback (HRV):** Monitoring Heart Rate Variability (HRV) immediately after a meal can provide insights into how the body responds to different foods. A drop in HRV suggests a stressful or non-optimal response.
*   **Applied Kinesiology (Muscle Testing):** A non-local response test that can determine if a food is in one's highest and best interest to consume. It can be performed by simply holding a food in mind.
*   **Gut Biome Testing:** Provides detailed analysis of the gut microbiome and personalized dietary recommendations.

## Neurofeedback and Mind Control

*   **Neurofeedback:** A technique that uses real-time displays of brain activity (EEG) to teach self-regulation of brain function.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Enhances resilience, allowing individuals to handle stress more effectively.
    *   Teaches the brain to achieve specific states (alpha, theta, delta, gamma) and flow states.
    *   Acts as a highly effective tool for learning meditation and self-awareness quickly.
*   **Future of Health Technology:** Anticipated advancements in blood monitoring and machine learning will provide instant, personalized insights into how diet and exercise impact the body, revolutionizing health optimization.
