# 2019-03-18 Most common autophagy lies

### Executive Summary
*   Autophagy is a catabolic state triggered by energy deprivation, mediated by AMPK activation and mTOR suppression.
*   The timeline for inducing autophagy is highly individual and diet-dependent; short fasts (16-20 hours) are often insufficient due to the prolonged post-absorptive state.
*   Excessive autophagy can be detrimental, potentially aiding tumor survival or contributing to muscle wasting and sarcopenia.
*   Beyond fasting, exercise and specific compounds found in certain foods (e.g., sulforaphane, curcumin, resveratrol, black coffee polyphenols) can also promote autophagy.
*   Factors like high caloric intake (even from fat), amino acids (BCAAs), insulin, and liver glycogen replenishment (fructose) can inhibit autophagy.

## Autophagy Fundamentals
Autophagy is a catabolic state triggered by energy deprivation. Energy-deprived states activate AMPK, a fuel sensor that initiates autophagy. To trigger autophagy, insulin needs to be suppressed, as it promotes energy storage. Excess amino acids and protein inhibit autophagy by raising mTOR, which is the anabolic switch. Caloric restriction and fasting are the most well-known methods for promoting autophagy.

**Autophagy Process:**
Energy Deprivation -> Activate AMPK -> Suppress Insulin -> Suppress mTOR -> Autophagy

## Autophagy Activation Timeline
While some individuals on a standard diet might take three days to achieve ketosis and autophagy, there is no universal timeline. Autophagy activation is governed by the individual balance of mTOR and AMPK, which varies based on diet. A lower-carb, moderate-protein diet can accelerate entry into a ketogenic and autophagic state.

## Efficacy of Short Fasts
Short fasts (16-20 hours) are often insufficient for significant autophagy. The body remains in a post-absorptive state for approximately four hours after a meal. A true fasted state only begins five to six hours after eating, after nutrients have been digested. Therefore, a 16-20 hour fast typically provides only about 12 hours in a truly fasted state, which may not be adequate to trigger robust autophagy.

## Risks of Excessive Autophagy
Excessive autophagy can have negative consequences. Pathogens like *Brucella* can exploit autophagy for replication. Autophagy may enhance tumor cell fitness, making them more resilient to environmental stressors and potentially aiding their survival. Furthermore, over-activation of autophagy can contribute to muscle wasting and sarcopenia, which negatively impacts longevity. While beneficial, autophagy is not ideal all the time.

## Autophagy vs. Starvation
While autophagy involves energy deprivation, it's distinct from traditional starvation in a healthy individual. The body utilizes stored body fat as an energy source; even lean individuals with around 10% body fat possess approximately 40,000 to 50,000 calories, enough for weeks or months of survival. Autophagy is a process where the body recycles its weaker cellular components and proteins for energy, a mechanism that wouldn't occur while consistently eating. Basal autophagy increases longevity and lifespan, being a central component to the life extension observed in caloric restriction.

## Autophagy and Muscle Anabolism
Autophagy primarily facilitates a catabolic state, breaking down cellular components. Muscle building requires muscle protein synthesis, which is driven by dietary protein intake, especially essential anabolic amino acids like leucine. While autophagy theoretically recycles old proteins for energy, it's generally insufficient to support significant muscle anabolism, particularly during extended fasts where external protein sources are absent. Exceptions may occur in very overweight, untrained individuals at a caloric deficit, who can simultaneously lose fat and build muscle. However, building muscle on longer, extended fasts remains extremely difficult.

## Autophagy and Skin Elasticity
While autophagy contributes to skin health, it does not literally 'eat' or tighten loose skin. A 2014 study in Japan found that aging fibroblasts, which produce skin collagen, exhibit decreased autophagy. A 2018 study from Korea found that aging fibroblasts experience a higher rate of waste production, contributing to skin aging. Autophagy plays a crucial role in counteracting the aging process of the skin by maintaining fibroblast health and supporting collagen production, but it will not directly eliminate significant loose skin.

## Impact of Fat Intake on Autophagy
While fat intake doesn't elicit the same insulin response as carbohydrates or protein, it can still inhibit autophagy, especially with excess calories. Ketosis, characterized by elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate and other ketone bodies, promotes brain macroautophagy via SIRT1 activation and also stimulates chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), which targets specific substrates. However, mTOR, the anabolic switch, responds not only to carbohydrates and amino acids but also to fat and overall caloric intake. Therefore, consuming excess calories from fat will stimulate mTOR and suppress general autophagy. Small amounts of 100% pure fats like MCT oil or coconut oil might not completely stop autophagy due to their ketone-elevating properties and potential CMA promotion, but consuming significant caloric amounts from fat is likely to inhibit it.

## Branch-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs) and Autophagy
Branch-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are potent inhibitors of autophagy due to their direct impact on mTOR activation. Consuming BCAAs will definitely halt autophagy. A potential exception might be during fasted exercise, where the body is already depleting glycogen stores and experiencing elevated blood sugar, potentially mitigating some of the inhibitory effects.

## Autophagy on High-Protein/Carnivorous Diets
The belief that eating meat or a high-protein diet permanently inhibits autophagy is a misconception. Eating frequency is a critical factor. A high-carbohydrate diet consumed multiple times a day will inhibit autophagy regardless of protein intake. Conversely, autophagy can be achieved even on a carnivorous or high-protein diet if caloric restriction is practiced, leading to sufficient energy deprivation. Carbohydrates and insulin are significant inhibitors of autophagy via mTOR activation. The relationship between diet and autophagy is complex and not a 'one-size-fits-all' scenario.

## Fructose and Autophagy
Fructose, commonly found in fruit, inhibits autophagy and ketosis by replenishing liver glycogen. The liver's glycogen content significantly mediates the balance between mTOR and AMPK, serving as a central hub for nutrient status and energy metabolism. While fruit can be healthy in moderation, it will break a fasted state and halt autophagy due to its impact on liver glycogen.

## Coffee and Autophagy
Black coffee does not break a fast or stop autophagy; it actually promotes both autophagy and ketosis. Coffee polyphenols directly stimulate the autophagy process, and the beverage supports it through additional mechanisms. For these benefits, coffee must be consumed black, without cream, milk, or sweeteners. Dairy products, in particular, will quickly inhibit autophagy by raising IGF-1 and subsequently insulin levels.

## Autophagy-Promoting Foods
While fasting is the most direct and easiest way to activate autophagy, certain foods can also promote the process, often synergistically with mild caloric restriction. Examples include:
*   **Sulforaphane:** Found in broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables.
*   **Curcumin:** From turmeric.
*   **Ginger:** Increases autophagy.
*   **Resveratrol:** From dark berries, red wine, and grape skin.
*   **Polyphenols:** From dark pigmented berries and vegetables.
*   **Medicinal mushrooms:** Induce autophagy.

## Exercise and Autophagy
Far from stopping autophagy, exercise is a potent promoter of the process, second only to fasting. Exercise induces autophagy in both peripheral tissues and the brain. Combining intermittent fasting with resistance training is considered an optimal strategy for overall health due to their synergistic effects on autophagy and muscle growth.
