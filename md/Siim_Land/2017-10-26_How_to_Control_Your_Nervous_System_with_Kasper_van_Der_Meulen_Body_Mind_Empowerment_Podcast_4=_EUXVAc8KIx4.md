# 2017-10-26 How to Control Your Nervous System with Kasper van Der Meulen Body Mind Empowerment Podcast 4=

## Executive Summary

*   **Personal Responsibility & Focus:** Gaining control over one's nervous system and physiology begins with taking full personal responsibility for one's life and developing the ability to focus inwards.
*   **Subconscious Influence:** A significant portion of human experience (at least 96%) operates subconsciously, often making individuals feel like life is 'happening to them' rather than being in control.
*   **Physiology as the Iceberg:** Mental and emotional states are only the 'tip of the iceberg'; underlying physiological systems (nutrition, breathing, posture, movement) are crucial for understanding and changing one's state. Our physiology is better at initiating and sustaining "fight or flight" responses.
*   **Practical Tools for Awareness:** Simple practices like journaling, meditation, and cold showers are effective for increasing self-awareness, improving concentration, and training the mental muscle to manage difficult situations.
*   **Fear as Physiology:** Fear is a physiological response involving hormonal systems (adrenaline, cortisol) and is not merely psychological. Training in uncomfortable situations (like cold exposure) builds mental resilience and fosters trust in the body's innate wisdom.

## Kasper van Der Meulen's Approach

Kasper van Der Meulen, owner of Mind Lift, a training system focused on controlling the nervous system and physiology, emphasizes focus as the "superpower of the 21st century." His work, including training with Wim Hof, aims to teach individuals to look inward, understand their current state, identify its origins, and learn to change it.

The fundamental principle underlying his work is taking full responsibility for one's own life. Many people understand *why* they want to improve and *what* methods exist, but lack the *how* to integrate these practices into their daily lives. Mind Lift aims to provide practical, scientific understanding and simple techniques for self-empowerment.

### Mind Lift Self-Experimentation Method

Kasper's program guides individuals through a process to integrate new practices:

*   **Determine Current State:** Where am I now?
*   **Define Desired State:** Where do I want to go?
*   **Identify Best Tool:** What is the most effective method for me?
*   **Long-Term Integration:** How do I truly integrate this into my life for lasting change?

This approach often involves working outside the comfort zone, using strong triggers like ice baths. By observing one's response to such shocks, individuals can learn to consciously alter their reactions.

## The Mind-Body Connection and Nervous System

The brain and nervous system continuously process input from the external world and internal thoughts, converting it into output (behavior, actions, feelings).

*   Only about **4% of our experiences are fully conscious**.
*   At least **96% operates subconsciously**.

This subconscious dominance often leads to individuals feeling that negative states (e.g., eating junk food, anger, sadness) are *happening to them*, rather than being self-initiated. Understanding the nervous system allows individuals to trace these states back to their physiological roots.

**Physiological Influences on State:**

*   Nutrition
*   Breathing patterns
*   Thoughts
*   Movement
*   Posture

Our physiology is highly adapted to activate a "fight or flight" response rapidly when faced with danger. However, it is less efficient at deactivating this response once the threat is gone, leading to prolonged states of stress.

**The Iceberg Analogy:**
Mental and emotional states are merely the "tip of the iceberg." The vast majority—the underlying physiological systems—lie "below the water," often outside conscious awareness. Increased awareness helps bring more of this physiological 'iceberg' into consciousness, revealing the deeper causes of habitual behaviors like smoking.

## Practical Techniques for Self-Regulation

The modern world, with its overwhelming stimuli and rapid changes, can make individuals feel a lack of control. Education systems often train people for an outdated world, not teaching self-regulation. The key is to start by controlling the smallest possible thing: one's reaction to circumstances.

Here are three practical tips to build awareness and control:

*   **Journaling/Gratitude Diary:**
    *   Write down things you are proud of or grateful for daily.
    *   Use a pen and paper to engage motor skills and process thoughts physically.
    *   Helps externalize internal ideas and gain insight into inner workings.
*   **Meditation:**
    *   Simply start with any form of meditation (e.g., a 5-minute guided meditation from YouTube).
    *   Increases awareness, concentration, and body-mind connection.
    *   The emphasis is on starting, not on finding the "perfect" method.
*   **Cold Shower:**
    *   At the end of a warm shower, turn the water cold and stay until relaxed.
    *   This technique pushes you just outside your comfort zone, allowing you to observe and modify your response to difficult, scary stimuli.
    *   **Physiological benefits:** Improves circulation, breathing, and fat burning.
    *   **Mental benefits:** Trains mental resilience, builds confidence in facing challenges, and transfers to other life situations (e.g., difficult conversations at work).

## Understanding and Overcoming Fear

Fear is often more about perceived danger than actual danger, especially in controlled environments like a cold shower. It is both a physiological response and a psychological barrier.

**The Physiology of Fear:**
When the brain perceives a danger signal, it triggers:
Danger Signal (Brain) -> Adrenaline + Cortisol -> Physiological Response (e.g., fight/flight)
This is a natural, helpful system, acting as internal "doping."

**Addressing the Fear:**
*   **Challenge internal voices:** Recognize that the voice telling you something is a bad idea might not always be correct.
*   **Train mental muscle:** Consciously choose to proceed despite fear, training the ability to engage with difficult situations.
*   **Mind-Body Integration:** Practices like cold exposure help bridge the perceived gap between mind and body, fostering trust in the body's deep, evolutionary wisdom. Biohacking, in this context, is not about adding external things, but about reconnecting with our original, inherent capabilities.

**Integration vs. Overcoming:**
The goal is not necessarily to "conquer" or "overcome" fear, but to integrate difficult experiences and natural physiological responses into a conscious life. This involves making a conscious effort to reconnect with nature, both externally and internally, as modern life doesn't automatically facilitate this connection.

## Reconnecting with Nature and Internal Wisdom

Increased awareness allows individuals to step out of the 'black box' of unconscious input and automatic response.

**The Process of Awareness:**
Input (Stimulus) -> **Space (Choice, Awareness of Internal Processes like Heart Rate, Breath, Temperature)** -> Response (Freedom)

As Viktor Frankl stated, "Between stimulus and response, there is a space. And in that space lies our choice, and in that choice lies our freedom." The goal is to consciously inhabit this space.

## Kasper's Personal Practice

Kasper's daily morning ritual for connecting with nature and self-regulation:

*   **Go Outdoors Barefoot:** Step onto grass (or even the street) with bare feet.
*   **Grounding and Daylight Exposure:** Stand with feet on the ground, breathe fresh air, and keep eyes open to receive natural daylight. This signals the body's biorhythm that it's daytime, aiding alertness.
*   **Observe Nature:** Actively listen to birds, observe trees, feel the wind and weather changes. This effort helps acknowledge the presence of nature even in urban environments.
*   **Duration:** This simple ritual takes about ten minutes.

**Common Obstacles:**
People often hesitate due to fear of judgment ("What will my neighbors think?") or perceived lack of time ("I don't have ten minutes"). Kasper emphasizes that these are often excuses; actively enjoying life for even ten minutes is crucial.

## Insights from the Wim Hof Method

Kasper spent a year training with Wim Hof and now teaches instructors. The core lesson from the Wim Hof Method is to learn to feel what is going on inside the body, counteracting the common disconnection between thoughts and emotions.

*   **Cold as Feedback Loop:** Stepping into an ice bath or cold water provides immediate, intense feedback. If the mind wanders to external concerns (to-do lists, emails), shivering rapidly ensues. This forces presence with emotions and physical sensations.
*   **Overcoming Emotional Fear:** Many people fear feeling unpleasant emotions. Training in the cold—feeling something intensely uncomfortable—builds the mental muscle to acknowledge and be present with emotions without needing to change them.
*   **Breathing for Cold Acclimation:**
    *   **Calm Breathing:** When exposed to cold, the natural tendency is to hyperventilate. Consciously calming the breath helps move the body out of stress panic mode.
    *   **Wim Hof Breathing Technique:** This specific breathing method can chemically alter the body's pH level, allowing individuals to experience cold sensations without perceiving them as pain. This helps differentiate between cold and actual danger signals, reducing fear.

## Final Tips

*   **Start Small:** Begin with "micro versions" of challenging activities (e.g., a daily cold shower, a minute of barefoot outdoor time).
*   **Build Trust:** These small, consistent efforts build trust in one's own body and mental capabilities.
*   **Listen to Inner Voice:** Distinguish between programming/societal expectations and the authentic desires of the heart.
