# 2016-11-23 Habit 2 Begin With the End in Mind 7 Habits of Highly Effective People Summary Part Three

**Executive Summary**

*   Beginning with the end in mind means starting with a clear understanding of your destination and personal values, ensuring that efforts are directed towards what truly matters rather than just being busy.
*   All creations occur twice: first mentally (personal leadership, focusing on "doing the right things") and then physically (management, focusing on "doing things right").
*   To align with one's true self, it's essential to "rescript" or shift ingrained paradigms and beliefs, a process that requires self-awareness, objective self-assessment, meditation, and self-inquiry.
*   The most effective method for this is creating a personal mission statement based on desired character, contributions, achievements, and values, which then fuels proactivity.
*   Optimal effectiveness stems from being "principle-centered," deriving security, guidance, wisdom, and power from immutable principles rather than reactive external influences or other people-centered approaches.

## Understanding Habit 2: Begin With the End in Mind

Habit two, "Begin with the End in Mind," emphasizes starting with a clear understanding of your destination. It's easy to get caught up in activities and commitments that lack significant importance. One can be very busy without being very effective if they never stop to evaluate whether they are on the right track or if their actions truly matter to them. This habit is based on the principle that all things are created twice: first, as a mental construct or idea, and second, as a physical manifestation. Often, individuals follow paths laid out by others, subjected to societal conditioning and afflictive habits without noticing. It's essential to realize that you are the creator and in control of your own life.

## Personal Leadership vs. Management

Habit two is founded on the principles of personal leadership, which represents the first creation. This differs from management, which is the second creation.

*   **Management:** Is bottom-line focused. It asks, "How can I best accomplish certain things?" and "Am I doing things right?"
*   **Leadership:** Is top-line focused. It asks, "What are the things I want to accomplish?" and "Am I doing the right things?"

To practice personal leadership, you need to come to terms with your values as a person and what you want to accomplish with your life. Before setting any goals, identify your core values.

## Rescripting Your Narrative

Since birth, individuals have been unconsciously programmed by others. To take control of one's life, it's necessary to rewrite this script. Rescripting, or paradigm shifting, involves changing fundamental paradigms by replacing faulty beliefs with ones that serve personal growth and purpose.

To rescript yourself, you need enough self-awareness to step back from your analytical mind and objectively examine your paradigms. Assess whether your beliefs and values are beneficial or harmful to you.

## Methods for Developing Self-Awareness

*   **Meditation:** An effective method for developing greater meta-awareness. It helps you become more proactive by enabling you to disassociate from your thoughts or emotions.
*   **Self-Inquiry:** Knowing yourself is an essential component of living a meaningful life. This can be aided by:
    *   Keeping a journal
    *   Deep thinking
    *   Memorizing past memories to gain better insight into who you truly are.

## Creating a Personal Mission Statement

For Covey, the most effective way to begin with the end in mind is to create a personal mission statement or creed. This statement is based on:

*   **What you want to be:** Your character.
*   **What you want to do:** Your contributions, achievements, and values.

Having a greater mission makes you the essence of your own proactivity. To create your mission statement, use creative visualization and imagination. Envision your life as you want it to look like, empower that feeling, and then write it down.

## The Center of Influence: Your Core Paradigms

Rescripting your narrative and writing a personal mission statement starts from the center of your circle of influence, where your most basic paradigms originate. This center is the lens through which you see the world and forms the core essence of your vision and values. Whatever lies at your life's center will be the source of your security, guidance, wisdom, and power.

Common personal centers or core paradigms include:

*   Spouse-centeredness
*   Family-centeredness
*   Money-centeredness
*   Work-centeredness
*   Position-centeredness
*   Pleasure-centeredness
*   Friend-centeredness
*   Enemy-centeredness
*   Church-centeredness
*   Self-centeredness

None of these centers are ideal or optimal for increasing personal effectiveness. Instead, one should strive to be **principle-centered**. Principles are not reactive; they are not influenced by the moods of others or external circumstances. They are omnipresent. This centeredness empowers you, determined by your degree of knowledge and meta-awareness.

## Action Steps to Begin With the End in Mind

To achieve something worthwhile, you must begin with the end in mind. Follow these action steps to discover your destination and purpose:

1.  **Become the leader of your own life:** Determine what you want to accomplish and what you want to be remembered for.
2.  **Identify where your center of paradigms lies:** Pinpoint where you draw your sense of security, guidance, wisdom, and power.
3.  **Rescript your paradigms:** Based on your core values and purpose, determine whether your current beliefs and habits are helping or hindering you.
4.  **Write a personal mission statement:** Use visualizations to create a roadmap for your life.
