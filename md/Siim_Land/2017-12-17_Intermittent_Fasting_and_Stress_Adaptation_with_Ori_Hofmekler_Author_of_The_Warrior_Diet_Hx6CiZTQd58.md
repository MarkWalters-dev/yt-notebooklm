# 2017-12-17 Intermittent Fasting and Stress Adaptation with Ori Hofmekler Author of The Warrior Diet

## Executive Summary

*   Exposure to low-level stress promotes adaptation and resistance to higher levels of stress, crucial for resilience.
*   Energy deficit, particularly through intermittent fasting and exercise, is the ultimate trigger for hormesis and enhances stress resistance.
*   Chronic stress is detrimental and leads to inflammation, disease, and aging, whereas intermittent stress is beneficial.
*   Inhibition of the mTOR pathway, often overactivated by excess energy intake, is key to longevity and preventing aging-related diseases and cancer.
*   Stress-activated foods and nutrients can mimic the benefits of fasting and exercise, promoting longevity and health.

## The Influence of Military Service on Research

*   Early military experiences under extreme conditions highlighted the body's reactions to stress.
*   Trial and error in survival situations led to the conclusion that specific protocols can improve stress management (physical, nutritional, emotional).
*   A key observation was that minimizing food intake during prolonged physical drills was counter-effective.

## Stress Adaptation: A Biological Imperative

*   Biological fitness is defined by better survival and longer life, achieved by leveraging stress rather than succumbing to it.
*   Organisms possess an "inner program" designed to respond to stress, activating mechanisms that enhance resilience and improvement.
*   This stress response system is fundamental to the evolutionary process that helps organisms survive in a stressful world.

## The Impact of Modern Society on Biological Fitness

*   Modern society, with its food industry and technological advancements, often works counter to our biology.
*   We are freed from natural hardships but are losing our ability to survive as nature intended.
*   Technology outpaces evolution, leading to a lack of exposure to primal biological stresses that drive thriving and evolution.
*   This results in a shift towards the "survival of the unfeated," with widespread issues like obesity, diabetes, and reduced reproductive capacity.
*   The food industry is described as "animal cruelty" due to the way people eat today.

## Stress-Activated Food and Hormesis

*   **Stress-Activated Food Theory:** Organisms under stress produce molecules that enhance their health. The hypothesis is that "stressed food" is the healthiest.
*   **Hormesis:** A biological process where exposure to low-level stress promotes resilience to higher levels of stress.
    *   Examples: Learning in school, computer skills, gradually increasing gym weight.
    *   Applies to every cell and tissue in the body.
*   **Toxins and Hormesis:** Even seemingly toxic substances like cyanide, heavy metals, and MSG can be beneficial in small, controlled amounts.

## The Seven Principles of Stress

1.  **Exposure to low-level stress promotes adaptation and resistance to high-level stress.**
    *   Sudden, intense stress without prior conditioning can be overwhelming.
    *   Preparation for crises involves gradual exposure to stress.
    *   Conditioning the body to endure stress (nutritional and physical) can upgrade stress hormones to respond instantly and maintain resilience without panic or adrenal fatigue.
    *   It is a duty to condition ourselves and our children for potential crises.

2.  **Maximize resiliency to stress through nutritional and physical conditioning.**
    *   Intermittent fasting and exercising while fasting are key practices.

3.  **Low-level toxin exposure creates resiliency against toxicity by the same toxin.**
    *   The body can be trained to become resilient to certain toxins, even benefiting from them.
    *   Modern society's hyper-sanitization reduces this natural challenge.

4.  **Energy deficit is the ultimate overruling trigger of hormesis.**
    *   Depletion of energy (e.g., from exercise and fasting) is a powerful conditioning agent.
    *   Modern society promotes constant energy loading (frequent meals, fast-releasing carbohydrates/sugar), which inhibits stress resistance.
    *   **Glycogen Depletion:** Under maximal glycogen depletion, the body becomes extremely resilient, even to sugar, and shifts towards ketone fuel.
    *   **Benefits of Energy Deficit:** Activates heat shock responses for cell repair, digests and recycles sick cells, rejuvenates tissues, and wakes up dormant regenerative cells.
    *   Most people fail to activate these systems due to immediate post-exercise refueling.

5.  **Excess energy inhibits the ability to resist stress.**
    *   Overactivation of growth mechanisms like mTOR, beneficial in youth, leads to accelerated aging and cancer in adulthood.
    *   High glycemic foods and excess caloric intake stimulate these detrimental processes.
    *   Inflammation, driven by excess energy, is a precursor to disease and cancer.

6.  **Stress must be intermittent, not chronic, to be beneficial.**
    *   **Fight or Flight Response:** An effective but short-term response to intense danger.
    *   **Chronic Stress:** Prolonged activation of the stress response system leads to inflammation, degradation of tissues (including the brain), and a dysfunctional fight-or-flight response.
    *   **Intermittent Fasting (24-hour cycle):** Recommended to avoid putting the body under chronic nutritional stress.
    *   Chronic stress leads to exhaustion and a "giving up" state.

7.  **Resiliency to stress and hormesis promotes virility and delays sexual aging.**
    *   Organisms resilient to stress are selected to resist sexual aging.
    *   While stress typically inhibits sex hormones, adapted individuals can resist this inhibition, potentially leading to increased virility.
    *   Example: Salmon breeding before death, potential explanation for post-war baby booms.

## Biological Mechanisms of Stress Adaptation

*   **Stress Response Genes/Longevity Genes:**
    *   **AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase):** A key pathway that inhibits mTOR and extends life. Activated by energy depletion (increased AMP concentration).
        *   Transforms the body by:
            *   Inhibiting energy utilization.
            *   Shifting fuel from carbs to fat, and eventually to ketone fuel.
            *   Enhancing brain and muscle function.
    *   **Sirtuins:** Activated by sirtuin-activating compounds (e.g., resveratrol).
*   **Ketogenesis:** A beneficial metabolic state driven by energy deficit, especially advantageous for brain health and muscle function.
*   **Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs):** Activated by energy deficit, these proteins rejuvenate the body and can heal degenerative diseases. Research shows potential healing effects when administered externally, but the body can activate its own HSP system.
*   **Transcription Factors (e.g., PGC-1α):** Activated by energy deficit, they transform muscle and brain tissue, increase mitochondrial density, and enhance stamina, durability, and survival power. This leads to "lean muscle" optimized for survival, not just bodybuilding.

## Redefining Fitness: Biological vs. Modern Industry

*   **Modern Fitness Industry's Flaw:** Lack of clear definition of goals beyond aesthetics or performance. Focus on building muscle and "pumping iron."
*   **Biological Fitness:** Defined by better survival, longer life, and longer virility.
*   **Approach:**
    *   **Modern:** Exercise to build muscle, eat to fuel growth.
    *   **Biological:** Exercise to deplete energy, promoting muscle quality and fat utilization.
*   **Controlled Fatigue Training (CFT):** Short, intense exercise routines that activate inherent species-specific movements, ideally combined with fasting.
*   **Goal:** Maximum life, not just maximum performance.
*   **Muscle Quality:** Pumping iron with pre/post-meal fueling leads to fast glycolytic muscle (Type IIb) that cannot utilize fat. Biological fitness cultivates muscle that can shift to fat/ketone fuel, essential for longevity and durability.
*   **Aesthetics:** Lean, biologically fit individuals are considered more attractive and age more gracefully than over-pumped bodybuilders.

## mTOR Pathway and Aging

*   **Overactivation of mTOR:** Driven by excess energy intake (especially high glycemic foods), it shortens life, accelerates aging, and promotes cancer.
*   **Inhibition of mTOR:** The key pathway to longevity.
*   **Pharmaceutical Industry's Role:** Focus on finding single molecules or drugs to inhibit mTOR for profit, overlooking the broader dietary and lifestyle approaches.

## Stress-Activated Nutrients and Practical Applications

*   **Stress-Activated Foods:** Contain nutrients that trigger longevity pathways (AMPK) and mimic the effects of exercise and fasting. These are often found in parts of food we discard (bark, peels, pits).
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Berberine:** More effective than metformin for reversing diabetes.
    *   **Cocoa Bean:** A potent stress-activated nutrient with neuroprotective qualities.
    *   **Berries (Blueberries, Strawberries, Raspberries):** Contain "anti-nutrients" that reduce blood sugar and lipid elevation post-meal, counteracting a major contributor to obesity and diabetes.
*   **Nutritional Product Innovation:** Developing "junk food" alternatives that are genuinely healthy, focusing on taste and texture.
    *   **Healthy Cookies:** No added sugar, no refined flour, high-quality protein.
    *   **Healthy Chocolate:** Eliminating sugar and other additives from cocoa.
*   **Defense Nutrition (defensenutrition.com):** Website offering information on stress-activated food and longevity.

## Practical Tip: Intermittent Fasting

*   **Number One Step:** Implement intermittent fasting. Stop eating frequently throughout the day.
*   **Gradual Approach:**
    *   Start with shorter fasting windows (3-5 hours).
    *   Minimize food intake to light options like berries if full fasting is not feasible.
    *   Create a negative energy balance.
    *   Turn walking days into under-eating or fasting days.
*   **Benefits:** Initiates body conditioning, improves stress resilience.
