# 2019-03-11 AUTOPHAGY MISTAKES That Stop Autophagy

## Executive Summary

*   Autophagy is primarily triggered by low insulin, low amino acid, and low glucose states, which suppress mTOR.
*   Fasting for insufficient duration (less than 5-6 hours post-meal) or consuming fat, BCAAs, or artificial sweeteners can inhibit autophagy.
*   While some low-calorie supplements may have minimal impact, cumulative caloric intake from supplements can disrupt autophagy.
*   Optimizing sleep, especially during the early night hours, is crucial as autophagy is most active during deep sleep.
*   Consistency in fasting, including shorter frequent fasts and adequate nutrient intake during eating windows, is more beneficial than infrequent prolonged fasts.

## Understanding Autophagy Triggers

Autophagy is a cellular process that can be activated by several factors. The most effective known methods are caloric restriction and intermittent fasting. These practices lead to:

*   **Low Insulin Levels:** A key indicator for the body to shift towards catabolic processes like autophagy.
*   **Low Amino Acid Levels:** Specifically, the suppression of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), a cellular pathway that inhibits autophagy when active.
*   **Low Glucose Levels:** Further contributing to the metabolic state conducive to autophagy.

## Autophagy Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Insufficient Fasting Duration

*   The post-absorptive state, where the body digests recent nutrients, lasts approximately four hours after a meal.
*   Significant fasting benefits, including the initiation of autophagy, typically begin after five to six hours of not eating.
*   Fasting periods shorter than this often mean the body is still processing consumed calories and has not yet entered a true fasted state sufficient for autophagy. For example, a 16-20 hour fast might only involve 12 hours in a truly fasted state.

### 2. Fat in Coffee

*   While fat does not spike insulin as significantly as carbohydrates or protein, it can still elevate mTOR, thereby hindering autophagy.
*   Ketone bodies can stimulate autophagy in the brain, but this effect is primarily observed during prolonged starvation.
*   Adding calorie-containing fats like MCT oil can offer a minor boost to autophagy, but excess calories from any source (carbohydrates, protein, or fat) will ultimately raise mTOR and stop autophagy.

### 3. Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs)

*   BCAAs are pure amino acids and can quickly halt the fasting state and inhibit autophagy.
*   The only potential exception is during intense exercise when the body is actively burning glucose and blood sugar is elevated.

### 4. Artificial Sweeteners

*   Zero-calorie sweeteners can trigger an insulin response through the cephalic phase reflex, which prepares the gut for insulin release. This can interfere with fasting and autophagy.

### 5. Supplements with Calories

*   Low-calorie supplements like Vitamin D or krill oil (1-2 capsules) are unlikely to significantly break a fast or disrupt autophagy due to their minimal fat content.
*   Herbal supplements such as turmeric, berberine, or mushroom complexes generally have an insignificant caloric impact and may even promote autophagy.
*   **The critical issue arises when consuming a large quantity or variety of supplements.** The cumulative calories from these can eventually reach a tipping point, stopping autophagy.
*   For fasts shorter than five to seven days, supplements are generally unnecessary as nutrient deficiencies are unlikely to occur. It is advisable to avoid them during such periods.

### 6. Circadian Rhythm Mismatches

*   A significant portion of autophagy activation occurs during deep sleep.
*   Growth hormone, which is also important for repair, is primarily released between 11 PM and 2 AM.
*   Prioritizing earlier bedtimes and optimizing the initial hours of sleep is recommended for maximizing autophagy and physical repair.

### 7. Lack of Prolonged Fasts

*   Significant autophagy benefits are unlikely to be achieved without incorporating extended fasts beyond 24 hours.
*   A recommended approach includes aiming for a three to five-day fast every other month, supplemented by two to three 48-hour fasts per month.
*   A general guideline is to perform at least one three-day fast per quarter.

### 8. Fasting Too Long or Too Frequently

*   Signs of muscle loss or excessive weakness indicate that fasts are too long or too frequent for the individual.
*   Individuals with significant weight to lose may tolerate longer, back-to-back fasts. Leaner, active individuals may need to adjust their fasting protocols.
*   **Consistency is paramount.** Frequent, shorter fasts (48-72 hours) are often more beneficial and sustainable than very infrequent, prolonged fasts followed by periods of poor eating habits.

### 9. Insufficient Nutrient Intake During Eating Windows

*   When eating frequency is low, the nutrient density of meals must be high to ensure adequate intake of essential nutrients.
*   Autophagy requires specific nutrients to function effectively.
*   Highly nutrient-dense foods include: pastured eggs, wild fish, beef, organ meats, low-carb berries, herbs, spices, certain tubers, vegetables, and small amounts of fruit.
*   Overconsuming calories, even during eating windows, requires the body to burn through those excess calories first, delaying the return to autophagy.

### 10. Lack of Exercise

*   Combining fasting with exercise significantly enhances autophagy.
*   If not fasting, incorporating some form of daily time-restricted eating is beneficial.
*   Exercise, particularly resistance training, is a powerful promoter of autophagy and other health benefits.
