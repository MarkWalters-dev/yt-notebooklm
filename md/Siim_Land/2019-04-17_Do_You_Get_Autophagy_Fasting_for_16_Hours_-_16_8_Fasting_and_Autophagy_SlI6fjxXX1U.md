# 2019-04-17 Do You Get Autophagy Fasting for 16 Hours - 16 8 Fasting and Autophagy

## Executive Summary

*   Fasting for 16 hours may result in only mild autophagy, if any, and is generally insufficient to reach therapeutic levels.
*   The duration to trigger significant autophagy depends on an individual's nutrient balance, particularly glucose, amino acids, and insulin, and the regulation by mTOR and AMPK.
*   Liver glycogen depletion is a key factor for entering ketosis and stimulating autophagy; it typically takes 16-20 hours of fasting.
*   Factors like caloric restriction, low carbohydrate intake, and exercise can significantly speed up liver glycogen depletion and enhance autophagy initiation.
*   While 16:8 fasting may not strongly induce autophagy, it still provides other significant physiological benefits like improved insulin sensitivity and fat adaptation.

## Understanding Autophagy Triggers

Autophagy is regulated by nutrient and growth factors, primarily glucose, amino acids, and insulin, which influence the body's anabolic-catabolic balance. The key fuel sensors monitoring this balance are mTOR and AMPK. The time it takes for autophagy to initiate is dependent on the specific balance of these factors.

### The Role of Liver Glycogen

Liver glycogen content plays a crucial role in the balance between mTOR and AMPK and dictates whether the body is burning ketones or glucose (glycolysis).

*   The liver stores approximately 100-150 grams of glycogen.
*   A full liver glycogen store inhibits ketone body formation and autophagy.
*   When liver glycogen is depleted, the body begins to create ketone bodies from fat.

### Time to Deplete Liver Glycogen

*   **Without intervention:** It takes approximately 16-20 hours of fasting to deplete liver glycogen.
*   **With physical activity:** Activities such as walking, cardio, or exercise can significantly speed up liver glycogen depletion.

## Intermittent Fasting and Autophagy

The 16:8 intermittent fasting method involves fasting for about 16 hours and eating within an 8-hour window.

### 16:8 Fasting and Autophagy Effectiveness

*   **General Observation:** Fasting for only 16 hours is generally insufficient to induce significant autophagy.
*   **Influencing Factors:** The extent of autophagy achieved during a 16-hour fast depends heavily on the composition of food consumed during the eating window, particularly carbohydrate and protein intake.
*   **Caloric Intake:** Consuming excess calories of any kind will inhibit autophagy by activating mTOR and require the body to burn through stored fuel first.
*   **Post-Absorptive State:** The post-absorptive state, where the body begins to utilize stored energy, typically lasts about 4 hours after a meal.
*   **Physiological Fasting:** A true physiological fast, where the body is actively seeking fuel from reserves, generally begins 5-6 hours after the last meal.
*   **16-Hour Fast Analysis:** In a 16-hour fast, if the last meal is at 7 PM, the physiological fast realistically starts around midnight. This results in approximately 12 hours of actual fasted state, which is likely not enough to trigger autophagy.

### Achieving Mild Autophagy with 16:8 Fasting

To experience mild autophagy during a 16-hour fast, several conditions are generally recommended:

*   Practicing mild caloric restriction.
*   Consuming a low-carbohydrate diet.
*   Avoiding fruits, as fructose can refill liver glycogen.
*   Moderating protein intake to avoid overconsumption.
*   Incorporating fasted walking or exercise.

### Stimulating Autophagy Without Significant Calories

Certain non-caloric or low-caloric substances can stimulate the autophagy process:

*   Black coffee
*   Herbal teas
*   Apple cider vinegar
*   Medicinal mushrooms
*   Turmeric
*   Berberine
*   Cayenne pepper

Breaking a 16-hour fast with these items may prolong some of the physiological effects.

## Ketogenic Diet and Autophagy

*   **Ketone Bodies:** Ketone bodies, particularly beta-hydroxybutyrate, stimulate chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), which targets specific amino acids and substrates.
*   **Ketogenic Diet:** Being in ketosis while on a ketogenic diet can support autophagy by stimulating CMA.
*   **Therapeutic Ketogenic Diet Ratios:** Typically consists of 5% carbohydrates, 15-20% protein, and 70-80% fat.
*   **MCT Oil and Coconut Oil:** These fats can mildly stimulate autophagy but excessive caloric intake from any source will inhibit it by activating mTOR.

## Alternative Fasting Strategies

While 16:8 fasting offers benefits, longer fasting periods or other eating patterns may be more effective for autophagy.

### One Meal a Day (OMAD)

*   A one meal a day diet, with approximately 22-23 hours of fasting, is considered more autophagic than 16:8 fasting.
*   On OMAD, it's possible to consume carbohydrates and still enter ketosis by the end of the next day, provided consumption is not excessive.

### Prolonged Fasting

*   Periodic prolonged fasts, such as three days every once in a while, can offer more significant autophagic benefits.

## Broader Benefits of Time-Restricted Eating

Even if 16:8 fasting does not strongly induce autophagy, it provides substantial physiological benefits:

*   Improved insulin sensitivity
*   Lower blood glucose levels
*   Increased fat adaptation
*   Better blood sugar regulation
*   Other hormonal benefits

## Conclusion

The 16:8 fasting method is considered a bare minimum for most individuals due to its significant physiological benefits. It helps maintain lower liver glycogen levels, enabling the body to enter ketosis and potentially autophagy more frequently. For enhanced autophagy, longer fasting periods or other dietary and lifestyle adjustments are recommended.
