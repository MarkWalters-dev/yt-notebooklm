# 2019-05-06 Does Coffee Stop Autophagy - Autophagy and Coffee

## Executive Summary
*   Coffee does not stop autophagy; it actually stimulates and boosts autophagic flux in various organs, including the liver, heart, and muscles, in mice models.
*   Caffeine stimulates hepatic (liver) fat oxidation and downregulates mTOR signaling, both factors that support the fasted/catabolic state.
*   Polyphenols in coffee, which is a major source of dietary polyphenols, can stimulate autophagy and are being investigated as a therapeutic strategy for conditions like cancer and metabolic syndrome.
*   For maximal benefit, coffee should be consumed black, without milk or sweeteners, as caloric additions may shift the body out of the fasted state.
*   The half-life of caffeine is approximately 5.7 hours; therefore, caffeine consumption should cease before 2:00 PM to avoid disrupting sleep cycles and circadian rhythm synchronization.

## Autophagy Fundamentals and Fasting
Autophagy occurs continuously at a basal level in various tissues. Unless an individual has broken metabolism or insulin resistance, some basal autophagy should be present constantly.

Fasting (not consuming calories) is a highly effective method for activating autophagy, similar to exercising or taking a sauna.

## Coffee Composition and Fasting Status
*   A single cup of coffee contains approximately 100–200 mg of caffeine and 4–5 calories.
*   This caloric content is generally not sufficient to break a fast or shift the metabolism out of a fasted state.
*   Although coffee may stimulate liver enzymes or affect gut bacteria, the primary anabolic signalers, such as insulin and mTOR, remain suppressed, maintaining the catabolic state required for fasting.

**Note on Hydration:** If the argument that stimulating digestion breaks a fast holds true for coffee, the same would logically apply to water, including salted water, which is arguably a more potent digestive stimulant than black coffee.

## Coffee and Autophagy Stimulation
The polyphenolic compounds found in coffee have been shown to stimulate autophagy.

*   **Mice Data on Caffeine and Autophagy:**
    *   Caffeine stimulates hepatic fat oxidation and autophagic flux in Little (dwarf) mice.
    *   Caffeine activates the autophagy-lysosomal pathway in the liver and downregulates mTOR signaling.
    *   Administering both regular and decaffeinated coffee increased autophagic flux in all investigated organs (liver, heart, and muscles) within one to four hours of consumption.
*   **Conclusion:** Coffee does not inhibit autophagy; it actively stimulates it, enhancing the benefits of the fast. Multiple cups of black coffee can generally be consumed during a fasted period.

## Maintaining the Fasted State with Beverages and Fats
For the orophagic benefits of coffee to apply, it should be consumed as black coffee (without milk or sweeteners).

*   **Ketones and Autophagy:** Ketone bodies stimulate both chaperone-mediated autophagy and macroautophagy in the brain.
*   **Fat Consumption:** Fat does not spike insulin or mTOR and helps maintain the fasted state. However, consuming excessive calories from fat will eventually shift the body into a fed state and activate mTOR.
    *   A maximum of approximately 100 calories from fats may be tolerated during a fast. Acceptable sources include coconut oil, MCT oil, or butter.
    *   Heavy cream is questionable because it contains protein and sugar, which can significantly influence IGF-1 levels and anabolism.
*   **Recommendation for Certainty:** To be 100% certain of maintaining autophagic flux, consume nothing but black coffee. MCT oil is suggested if one wishes to prolong the fast without breaking it prematurely.

## Circadian Rhythm and Caffeine Timing
Caffeine has a biological half-life of approximately 5.7 hours. If coffee is consumed at 12:00 PM, 50% of the caffeine remains active in the system by 6:00 PM.

**Caffeine Timing Recommendations:**

1.  **Stop Time:** Consumption should cease before 2:00 PM, and ideally, no coffee should be consumed in the afternoon.
2.  **Circadian Benefit:** Drinking coffee in the morning kickstarts metabolism, synchronizing the body with the environment. If meals are restricted to the afternoon or evening, morning coffee helps maintain wakefulness throughout the day and keeps the circadian rhythm synchronized.

**Summary:** Coffee can boost autophagy and fat oxidation during a fasted state, but consumption must be timed strategically to avoid negative side effects like addiction or sleep disruption.
