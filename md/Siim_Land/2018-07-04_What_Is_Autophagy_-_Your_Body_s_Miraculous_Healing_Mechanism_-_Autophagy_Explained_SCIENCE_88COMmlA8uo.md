# 2018-07-04 What Is Autophagy - Your Body's Miraculous Healing Mechanism - Autophagy Explained SCIENCE

## Executive Summary

*   Autophagy, or "self-eating," is a cellular process where cells break down and remove dysfunctional components, recycling cellular debris.
*   Autophagy is crucial for various physiological benefits, including reduced inflammation, improved immunity, anti-aging, longevity, and suppression of cancerous tumors.
*   Autophagy is primarily triggered by nutrient deprivation and regulated by the interplay between mTOR (inhibitory) and AMPK (activatory).
*   Fasting and exercise are key strategies to activate and benefit from autophagy, promoting a balance between cellular growth (anabolism) and breakdown (catabolism).
*   While beneficial, a balanced approach is necessary, as excessive or defective autophagy can lead to negative health outcomes.

## What is Autophagy?

Autophagy, also known as autophagocytosis, translates from Greek as "self-digestion" or "eating of self." It is a fundamental metabolic process where cells break down and remove their own dysfunctional components. This process is akin to cellular recycling, removing waste and damaged parts to maintain cellular health and function.

Initially believed to be a hormonal response solely to starvation, recent research indicates that autophagy plays a much broader role in biology.

### Benefits of Autophagy

Autophagy confers numerous health benefits, including:

*   Reduction in inflammation
*   Improved immune system function
*   Prevention of genotoxic stress
*   Anti-aging and longevity effects
*   Suppression of cancerous tumor cells
*   Elimination of infectious pathogens and toxins
*   Overall rejuvenation and youthfulness

Inability to properly induce autophagy has been linked to negative health outcomes, such as increased body fat, reduced activity, elevated cholesterol levels, and impaired brain function. Compromised autophagy pathways diminish the body's ability to heal from inflammation, toxin accumulation, and parasitic infections.

## Discovery and Nobel Prize

The foundational research into the mechanisms of autophagy was recognized with the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine awarded to Yoshinori Ohsumi on October 3, 2016. His work, primarily conducted in simple organisms like baker's yeast, established that the autophagy-related pathways are conserved across mammals and humans.

## How Autophagy Works

When autophagy is activated, cellular organelles identify and engulf damaged or diseased cellular components. This process is mediated by the **autophagosome**, a double-membrane vesicle. The autophagosome fuses with lysosomes, forming an autolysosome, which then degrades and recycles the enclosed cellular material.

The precise formation mechanism of the autophagosome is still an area of active research. In yeast, it involves the convergence of autophagy-related (ATG) proteins at a structure called the preautophagosomal structure (PAS). Similar structures are believed to exist in mammalian cells, though their detailed function remains under investigation.

Autophagy can be visualized as a cellular "fight club" where weak or damaged cells are selectively identified and eliminated for the overall health of the organism.

## Triggers for Autophagy

Autophagy is primarily triggered by **nutrient deprivation**. In various organisms, including yeast and plant cells, starvation of essential nutrients like nitrogen and carbon can activate this process.

In mammals, autophagy occurs in different tissues and degrees:

*   **Macroautophagy:** A general cellular process.
*   **Mitoautophagy:** Specific breakdown of damaged mitochondria.
*   **Muscle autophagy:** Autophagy within muscle cells.
*   **Brain autophagy:** Autophagy in neural tissues.

### Hormonal Regulation

The endocrine system, particularly **insulin** and **glucagon**, plays a significant role in regulating autophagy.

*   **Insulin:** Suppresses liver autophagy by signaling nutrient abundance. Elevated insulin levels are typically associated with high blood sugar and nutrient intake.
*   **Glucagon:** Counteracts insulin by releasing liver glycogen for energy, which can increase autophagy. Glucagon often signals nutrient deprivation.

### Signaling Pathways

Autophagy is intricately linked to nutrient signaling pathways:

*   **mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin):** A master regulator of cellular growth and protein synthesis. mTOR generally **inhibits** autophagy. Suppressing mTOR, for example, with rapamycin, can induce autophagy.
*   **AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase):** A cellular energy sensor that **activates** autophagy. AMPK promotes energy mobilization and breakdown of cellular components during periods of nutrient scarcity.

The interplay between mTOR and AMPK is crucial. During nutrient deprivation, AMPK becomes active, inhibiting mTOR and promoting autophagy. Conversely, when nutrients are abundant, mTOR is active, suppressing autophagy and favoring growth.

Autophagy is best understood not as a simple on/off switch but as a **degree-dependent state** influenced by the level of nutrient depletion and deprivation in the organism. When the body lacks essential nutrients, it mobilizes stored energy sources, including liver glycogen, muscle glycogen, ketone bodies, fatty acids, and even damaged cells.

### Inhibitors of Autophagy

A key inhibitor of autophagy in muscles is the kinase **AKT**. AKT can regulate autophagy through:

1.  **Rapid regulation of mTOR activation.**
2.  **Slower gene transcription via FOXO3 proteins.** AKT activation blocks FOXO3, which controls the transcription of autophagy-related genes, thereby inhibiting autophagy.

## Autophagy and Metabolism

Autophagy is a **catabolic pathway** involving the breakdown of old or damaged cells. However, it is essential for maintaining **muscle homeostasis**. Impaired autophagy can contribute to aging and muscle wasting (sarcopenia).

*   **Good autophagy:** Promotes muscle mass maintenance, better metabolic health, reduced cardiovascular disease risk, and increased longevity.
*   **Defective or excessive autophagy:** Can lead to muscle disorders and loss of lean tissue, potentially promoting premature aging.

A balance between anabolic (building up) and catabolic (breaking down) pathways is vital. While mTOR and insulin are necessary for building new tissue, constant nutrient supply inhibits autophagy. Periods of nutrient deprivation are required to enhance cellular sensitivity to nutrients and activate autophagy.

Fasting is a powerful tool that can:

*   Resets the immune system.
*   Triggers stem cell growth.
*   Makes cells more efficient in metabolizing nutrients.
*   Opens access to stored energy within cells.

## Autophagy and Exercise

Autophagy is essential for **skeletal muscle plasticity** in response to endurance exercise. The activation of **AMPK** is necessary for autophagy during exercise.

*   **Exercise in a fasted state** leads to a significantly higher autophagic response compared to exercise in a fed state. This is because the body directly utilizes stored fat for energy, rather than burning recently consumed food.
*   AMPK activation during exercise shifts the body from burning glucose to burning fat, increasing glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation while inhibiting glucose production and fat synthesis.
*   AMPK also plays a critical role in **skeletal muscle protein turnover**. When AMPK is active during a protein deficit, the body enters a protein-sparing state, maintaining muscle mass.

A ketogenic state, often achieved through low-carb diets, can facilitate this protein-sparing effect by activating AMPK and promoting autophagy.

The body constantly cycles between anabolism and catabolism. A healthy life requires promoting growth and repair while also eliminating old cells and metabolic debris. Contemporary eating habits of frequent small meals may hinder this "trash removal" process.

## Activating Autophagy

While the exact duration to activate autophagy varies by individual and tissue, certain strategies can promote it:

*   **Fasting:** Consuming no calories for a period is the most direct way to induce autophagy.
    *   **Intermittent Fasting:**
        *   Fasting for at least 16 hours daily (18-20 hours recommended) can deplete liver glycogen and lower blood glucose, leading to mild ketosis.
        *   Maintaining low insulin and blood sugar levels is crucial, as carbs and some proteins elevate insulin, suppressing autophagy.
        *   Limiting protein and carbohydrate intake can help manage mTOR and IGF-1 levels, which can accelerate aging and cancer growth.
    *   **Extended Fasts:** Fasting for 48 hours or more is recommended to allow stem cells and the immune system to perform their functions. 3-5 day fasts, performed 2-3 times per year, can effectively burn fat and recycle weak cells.

*   **Resistance Training:** Essential for maintaining lean muscle mass, which is vital for metabolic health and longevity.
    *   Exercising in a depleted or low glycogen state can elevate growth hormone.
    *   Consuming anabolic amino acids and protein post-workout supports muscle growth and recovery.
    *   A minimal effective dose of protein post-workout helps avoid overstimulating mTOR for prolonged periods.
    *   Lowering insulin post-meal, for instance, with apple cider vinegar, can help return the body to a fasted state more quickly.
    *   Aerobic exercise can further stimulate autophagy.

*   **Autophagy Boosting Foods:** Certain foods and compounds can support autophagy:
    *   **Sulforaphane:** Found in cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, kale).
    *   **Azuki bean extract.**
    *   **Quercetin:** Found in onions, pomegranate, cranberries, garlic.
    *   **Medicinal mushrooms:** Reishi, Chaga.
    *   **Punicalagin:** Found in pomegranates.
    *   **Silibinin:** Found in milk thistle.
    *   **Gingers:** Sick shargle compound in ginger.
    *   **Resveratrol:** Found in dark grapes, berries, cherries, red wine.
    *   **Zinc:** Oysters, liver, red meat, eggs, salmon, pumpkin seeds.
    *   **Curcumin:** Found in turmeric.
    *   **Piperine:** Found in black pepper.
    *   **Tart cherry supplementation.**
    *   **Omega-3 fatty acids:** Especially DHA found in fish.
    *   **Coffee.**
    *   **EGCG (Epigallocatechin gallate):** Found in green tea.
    *   **Ursolic acid:** Found in apple skins, grape skins, berries.
    *   **Capsaicin:** Found in cayenne pepper.
    *   **Theobromine:** Found in cacao and dark chocolate.
    *   **Vitamin K2.**
    *   **Fenugreek extract.**
    *   **Cranberry extract.**
    *   **Extra virgin olive oil.**
    *   **Caloric restriction mimics:** Berberine, tamarind, rapamycin.

*   **Lymphatic System Stimulation:** Activities that stimulate the lymph system can have a carryover effect on autophagy by improving circulation and toxin flushing:
    *   Sweating through exercise, hot yoga, saunas.
    *   Infrared saunas.
    *   Red light therapy.
    *   Rebounding.
    *   Foam rolling.
    *   Consuming spicy foods.
    *   Foods that support the lymph system include coffee, teas, cayenne pepper, spirulina, activated charcoal, cruciferous vegetables, medicinal mushrooms, and spicy herbs.

## Balancing Anabolism and Catabolism

A constantly anabolic state is detrimental. It is crucial to balance periods of growth (supported by mTOR and insulin) with periods of breakdown and recycling (supported by AMPK and autophagy). This balance is essential for longevity and overall health.

While autophagy has profound benefits, it's important to note that some viruses can exploit this process for their replication. Therefore, a nuanced and skeptical approach to the research is advised. Autophagy all the time is not ideal; a balanced approach is key, especially for physically active individuals who need to support anabolism for muscle growth and repair.

The principle of autophagy mirrors personal development: periods of building up and breaking down, expansion and contraction, growth and death, are necessary for renewal and transcendence. This cyclical process applies to cells, purpose, ego, relationships, habits, and more.

## Conclusion

Autophagy is a vital cellular mechanism for maintaining health, promoting longevity, and facilitating healing. By understanding its triggers and regulators, and by implementing strategies like fasting, exercise, and consuming autophagy-boosting foods, individuals can harness its power for optimal well-being. However, achieving a balance between anabolic and catabolic processes is crucial for sustainable health.
