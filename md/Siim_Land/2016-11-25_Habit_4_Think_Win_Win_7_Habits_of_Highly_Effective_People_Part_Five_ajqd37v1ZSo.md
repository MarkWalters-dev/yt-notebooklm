# 2016-11-25 Habit 4 Think Win Win 7 Habits of Highly Effective People Part Five

**Executive Summary:**
*   The 'Think Win Win' habit is a philosophy of human interaction focused on interdependence and cooperation for public victory, rather than a mere technique.
*   Achieving Win-Win outcomes requires a balance of high courage and high consideration, where all parties benefit.
*   The foundation of Win-Win is strong character, built on integrity, maturity, and an abundance mentality – the belief that there is more than enough for everyone.
*   Win-Win relationships are sustained by mutual trust and consistent 'deposits' into an emotional bank account shared between individuals.
*   Practical application involves identifying obstacles, analyzing current relationship dynamics, and actively seeking mutual benefit in interactions.

## The Paradigm of Interdependence

Habits one, two, and three focus on self-mastery and personal governance. Habits four, five, and six, including "Think Win Win," are based on interdependence and represent paradigms of cooperation, leading to public victory. Thinking Win Win is a philosophy of human interaction.

## Six Paradigms of Human Interaction

There are six paradigms that describe human interaction outcomes:
*   **Win-Win:** All parties involved benefit.
*   **Win-Lose:** If one party wins, the other loses.
*   **Lose-Win:** One party loses for the other to win.
*   **Lose-Lose:** Both parties experience negative outcomes.
*   **Win:** Focus solely on personal winning, without considering others.
*   **Win-Win or No Deal:** The ideal scenario; if a Win-Win agreement cannot be reached, no deal is made, preserving future interactions.

## Key Factors for Win-Win: Courage and Consideration

Achieving Win-Win outcomes requires balancing two critical factors:
*   **High Courage, High Consideration:** Leads to Win-Win.
*   **Low Courage, High Consideration:** Leads to Lose-Win.
*   **High Courage, Low Consideration:** Leads to Win-Lose.
*   **Low Courage, Low Consideration:** Leads to Lose-Lose.

## The Foundation of Win-Win: Character

Character forms the bedrock of Win-Win thinking and involves three essential traits:
*   **Integrity:** Adherence to moral and ethical principles.
*   **Maturity:** The balance between courage and consideration.
*   **Abundance Mentality:** A paradigm where individuals believe there is more than enough out there for everyone. This contrasts with a scarcity or zero-sum mentality, which views life as a limited resource where one person's gain is another's loss.

## Building Win-Win Relationships

Win-Win relationships are built and maintained on a foundation of character, fostering:
*   **Mutual Trust:** Essential for effective cooperation.
*   **Emotional Bank Account:** A metaphor for the amount of trust built in a relationship. Regular positive interactions (deposits) strengthen the account, while negative interactions (withdrawals) deplete it. Building a robust emotional bank account is crucial for productive interactions.

## Action Steps for Thinking Win-Win

To cultivate a Win-Win mindset, follow these guidelines:

1.  Think about an upcoming interaction where an agreement or solution needs to be negotiated. Commit to maintaining a balance between courage and consideration.
2.  List obstacles that prevent more frequent application of the Win-Win paradigm. Determine what can be done within your circle of influence to eliminate some of these obstacles.
3.  Select a specific relationship for developing a Win-Win agreement. Try to understand the other person's perspective and explicitly write down how you believe they perceive the solution.
4.  Identify three key relationships in your life. Indicate the perceived balance in each emotional bank account. Write down specific ways to make 'deposits' (positive interactions) into these accounts.
5.  Analyze your current 'scripting' (habitual responses or ingrained beliefs) – whether it's Win-Lose or Lose-Win. Determine how this scripting affects interactions, identify its main source, and assess if it serves well in your current reality.
6.  Identify a model of Win-Win thinking, someone who consistently seeks mutual benefit even in challenging situations. Determine how to observe and learn from this person's example more closely.
