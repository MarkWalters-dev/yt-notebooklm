# 2018-11-01 Menno Henselmans Body Recomposition Secrets for Lean Muscle Growth

**Executive Summary:**
*   Body recomposition (building muscle and losing fat simultaneously) is physiologically possible and observed across various populations, from novices to elite athletes, especially with optimized training and nutrition.
*   Ketogenic diets can be highly effective for fat loss due to strong appetite suppression and do not necessarily impair strength training performance, as muscle glycogen can be efficiently resynthesized even without high carbohydrate intake.
*   High protein intake, around 1.6-1.8 grams per kilogram of total body weight per day, is crucial for muscle growth and fat loss, with no significant additional benefits observed beyond this range.
*   Muscle growth is primarily driven by training intensity (near failure) and total volume, with a wide range of rep schemes (from very heavy to 30% of 1RM) being effective as long as sets are taken close to failure.
*   Strategic protein and calorie timing, particularly around workouts, can optimize the "anabolic window" for muscle protein synthesis, especially for advanced trainees whose window may be shorter.

Menno Henselmans champions an evidence-based approach to fitness, relying on current scientific data to inform optimal strategies for muscle growth and fat loss.

## Current Fitness Trends and Fads

*   **CBD (Cannabidiol):** While popular, CBD's primary scientifically supported application is its anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing) effect, which can aid sleep. Broader claims of it being a magical cure-all are largely unsubstantiated.
*   **Exogenous Ketones:** Generally not recommended. While ketogenic diets can be effective, supplementing with exogenous ketones can actually hinder performance. The body appears ill-equipped to efficiently utilize both glucose and ketones simultaneously. Additionally, exogenous ketones contain calories and must induce significant appetite suppression to contribute to fat loss beyond their caloric contribution.

## Ketogenic Diets

Ketogenic diets (very low-carbohydrate) are a potent tool, particularly for fat loss, but their suitability varies among individuals due to adherence challenges or unique physiological responses.

*   **Appetite Suppression:** Keto diets are highly effective for appetite suppression. Studies indicate that individuals on ketogenic diets may lose fat even when intentionally aiming for weight gain, often due to an unintentional caloric deficit.
*   **Performance in Strength Training:** Contrary to common belief, ketogenic diets do not necessarily impede strength training performance.
    *   **Glycogen Resynthesis:** Muscle glycogen depletion from intense strength workouts typically ranges from 20-40%. Research indicates that 60-75% of muscle glycogen can resynthesize within six hours post-workout, even in a fasted state, through mechanisms like the Cori cycle.
    *   **Glucose Production:** The body efficiently produces glucose from non-carbohydrate sources (gluconeogenesis) via:
        Lactate Recycling -> Glucose
        Glycerol (from fats) -> Glucose
        Amino Acids (from protein) -> Glucose
    *   **Training Volume Threshold:** The high carbohydrate intake often considered essential is primarily beneficial for extremely high-volume endurance or concurrent training (e.g., team sports like soccer, rugby, tennis). Pure strength training and ultra-endurance activities appear less affected by low carbohydrate intake.
*   **Keto-Adaptation and Protein Sparing:** The initial keto-adaptation phase might temporarily lead to a negative protein balance. However, after several weeks (e.g., 6-8 weeks), being keto-adapted may result in an increased nitrogen balance and a protein-sparing effect, potentially reducing protein requirements.

## Body Recomposition: Building Muscle and Losing Fat Simultaneously

It is definitively possible to build muscle and lose fat at the same time, disproving the misconception that this violates thermodynamic principles.

*   **Thermodynamics Explained:**
    Energy Deficit -> Loss of Total Bodily Energy
    Energy Surplus -> Storage of Total Bodily Energy
    However, energy storage and loss can be compartmentalized. One can experience a net loss of total bodily energy (from fat) while simultaneously storing energy in the form of muscle mass. This balance is achievable because fat contains significantly more calories per kilogram than muscle.
*   **Observed in Research:** Body recomposition is not merely theoretical but is empirically observed across diverse populations:
    *   Novice and intermediate trainees
    *   The elderly
    *   Olympic athletes
    *   Female bikini and figure competitors (even at low body fat levels during contest preparation)
    *   Rugby players, elite gymnasts, and military personnel.
*   **Key Factors for Success:**
    *   **High Protein Intake:** Provides essential building blocks for muscle synthesis.
    *   **Effective Strength Training Program:** Acts as the primary stimulus for muscle growth.
    *   **Calorie Deficit:** Achieved through meticulous dietary management.
*   **Obese Individuals:** Obese individuals are ideal candidates for rapid and substantial body recomposition. Aggressive fat loss strategies are often highly beneficial, as losing fat quickly improves numerous health biomarkers (e.g., insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides), regardless of the diet's specific quality.
    *   **Psychological Benefits:** Rapid initial fat loss significantly boosts motivation and adherence.
    *   **Protein Sparing Modified Fast (PSMF):** An effective strategy for obese individuals, involving consuming primarily protein and essential micronutrients within a substantial caloric deficit to maximize fat loss while preserving muscle.

## Protein Intake and Muscle Growth Mechanisms

*   **Optimal Protein Intake:** For most individuals, an intake of 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of total body weight per day is sufficient. A recommendation of 1.8 g/kg/day accounts for individual variability and covers those with potentially higher requirements. Meta-analyses confirm no statistically significant additional benefits from exceeding this range in nutrient timing-controlled settings.
*   **The Role of Leucine and mTOR:**
    *   **Leucine:** A branched-chain amino acid (BCAA), particularly important as a signaling molecule that activates the mTOR pathway, a central regulator of muscle protein synthesis.
    *   **mTOR Pathway:** Integrates signals vital for muscle growth:
        Amino Acid Availability + Mechanical Tension on Muscle Fibers + Growth Factors -> mTOR Activation
    *   **Process of Muscle Protein Synthesis:**
        mTOR Activation -> Signal to DNA (cell nuclei) -> DNA transcribed to ribosomes (cellular protein factories) -> Ribosomes synthesize new proteins based on the genetic blueprint -> Increased contractile tissue (muscle growth).
*   **Ineffectiveness of BCAAs Alone:** Consuming BCAAs (especially leucine) without other essential amino acids will activate mTOR. However, this creates a bottleneck in protein synthesis because the necessary building blocks (other amino acids) are absent. Consequently, BCAAs alone are ineffective for increasing muscle protein synthesis. Whole protein sources (e.g., whey) are almost always superior and more cost-effective.
*   **Overconsumption of Protein:** Exceeding optimal protein intake (e.g., above 1.8 g/kg/day) typically results in the protein being oxidized for energy. If a caloric surplus exists, this often contributes to fat gain, as the body uses protein for fuel, thus sparing dietary fats and carbohydrates for storage.
    Protein Oxidation (for energy) -> Reduced need to burn dietary Fat/Carbs -> Storage of dietary Fat/Carbs (as fat)

## Training Principles

*   **Rep Range for Hypertrophy:** The traditional "hypertrophy zone" of 6-12 reps is an oversimplification. Studies demonstrate that a wide range of rep schemes, from very heavy weights to loads as light as 30% of one-rep max (30RM), can effectively stimulate muscle growth.
    *   **Key Factor:** Training *close to failure* is paramount. When a set is taken near failure, the muscle fibers activated toward the end of the set experience high levels of mechanical tension and recruitment, similar to those achieved with heavier weights.
    *   **Volume:** For very heavy weights (e.g., sets of 2), more total sets are required to accumulate sufficient "time under tension" for maximal growth. Training with very light weights to failure can be mentally demanding and highly fatiguing.
*   **Muscle Building Stimulus Duration:** Muscle protein synthesis typically remains elevated for 24-48 hours post-workout, and potentially longer (up to 72 hours) in untrained individuals.
*   **Training Frequency:** While one session per week can yield similar results to higher frequencies if total volume is sufficient, the general trend in scientific literature indicates that higher frequencies (e.g., training a muscle group 2-4 times per week) are equally effective or potentially more beneficial.
    *   **Volume vs. Frequency:** It is crucial to distinguish between total training volume (hard sets per muscle group) and frequency. Adding extra training days without adjusting total volume can lead to overtraining and injury.
    *   **Example:** Four full-body sessions per week can provide high frequency for muscle groups while maintaining a manageable gym schedule.

## Nutrient Timing and Intermittent Fasting

*   **Anabolic Window:** The duration of the "anabolic window" (period of elevated muscle protein synthesis post-training) diminishes as trainees become more advanced. For advanced bodybuilders, this window might be limited to a few hours, whereas for untrained individuals, it can extend for days.
*   **Synchronizing Nutrients:** It is advantageous to synchronize calorie and protein intake with this metabolic window.
    *   **Recommendation:** Prioritize higher protein and calorie intake in the period immediately following workouts and leading up to the evening.
    *   **Pre-workout Protein:** Having amino acids readily available in the bloodstream *before* training (e.g., from a meal consumed a few hours prior) is beneficial for fueling muscle protein synthesis and mitigating potential catabolism.
*   **Intermittent Fasting (IF):**
    *   **Fasted Training:** Generally not optimal for maximizing muscle growth, especially in the absence of pre-workout protein. Studies suggest that pre-workout protein consumption leads to higher training volume and superior muscle and strength development.
    *   **LeanGains Style IF:** This approach, which involves breaking the fast just before training and consuming most daily calories in the post-workout window, effectively synchronizes nutrients with the anabolic window and can be an effective strategy for body recomposition and lean mass maintenance.
    *   **Suboptimal IF:** Performing a workout early in the morning and then fasting for many hours before eating is likely suboptimal for maximizing muscle growth.

## Menno Henselmans' Personal Approach

*   **Diet:** Eats ad libitum (as desired) for maintenance, prioritizing high protein (above 1.8 g/kg/day), abundant vegetables, healthy fats, and avoiding starches that tend to promote overeating. His diet can be described as "paleo with artificial sweeteners and dairy."
*   **Meal Frequency:** Consumes two meals per day, strategically sandwiching his workout between them. The second (post-workout) meal is typically larger.
*   **Training:** Focuses on staying injury-free, performing compound lifts with variations, and setting sub-goals (e.g., squat personal records) to maintain motivation. Acknowledges being near his "natural maximum potential" after almost 16 years of training, with current muscle gains of less than a pound per year.
*   **Professional Services:** Offers online personal training courses and certification programs designed to equip individuals with effective PT skills. He also continues to provide coaching services. Currently, he is writing a book on the "science of self-control."

## Final Advice

*   **Maximize Well-being and Happiness:** The most crucial advice is to organize your life to maximize well-being and happiness. Happier individuals tend to be healthier, live longer, can exert greater effort in the gym, exhibit superior self-control, and adhere more easily to dietary plans. Cultivating happiness enables one to become a better version of oneself.
