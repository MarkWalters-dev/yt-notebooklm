# 2017-11-09 How to Grow New Brain Cells Through Neurogenesis

## Executive Summary

*   **Neuroplasticity and Neurogenesis are Core to Brain Health:** The brain is highly adaptable (neuroplasticity) even in adulthood, capable of restructuring and growing new brain cells (neurogenesis) in the hippocampus, which is crucial for cognition, intelligence, longevity, and protection against neurodegeneration.
*   **Protect Existing Brain Cells:** Effective stress management, adequate sleep, and minimizing exposure to environmental toxins (e.g., pollution, heavy metals, mold, junk light), alcohol, tobacco, drugs, and excessive sugar are critical for neuroprotection.
*   **Dietary Strategies for Neurogenesis:** Consuming Omega-3 fatty acids (especially DHA), antioxidants like Resveratrol and flavonols (found in berries, dark chocolate), Turmeric, EGCG (from green tea), adopting a ketogenic diet, caloric restriction, and intermittent fasting significantly promote the growth of new brain cells.
*   **Lifestyle Triggers for Neurogenesis:** Engaging in physical activity (exercise), experiencing natural sunlight (Vitamin D production), having sex (endorphin release), and consistently learning new things or facing novel situations are powerful stimuli for both neurogenesis and neuroplasticity.
*   **Maintain and Challenge Your Brain:** Simply growing new brain cells is not enough; maintaining them requires continuous physical and mental challenges, introducing variety into daily routines, and actively utilizing new neural pathways to ensure brain sharpness and adaptability.

## Introduction to Neuroplasticity and Neurogenesis

Neurons are brain cells that receive electrochemical signals, acting as the units of communication linked by thousands of synapses. These connections form the entire network of your brain, embodying your habits, self-image, and thought patterns as neural networks. The principle "neurons that fire together wire together" highlights how repeated actions strengthen these connections, making activities more automatic.

Before the 20th century, it was believed that brain neural networks were largely determined in childhood and remained relatively unchanged throughout life. However, recent neuroscience research demonstrates that the human brain is highly plastic and adaptable, even in adulthood. This capacity is called **neuroplasticity**, the brain's ability to restructure and replace many aspects of itself.

Neuroplasticity is vital for healthy brain development and maintenance, offering benefits such as:
*   Improved cognition and intelligence.
*   Increased longevity.
*   Protection against neurodegeneration.
*   Enhanced adaptability to change and stressful situations.

Improving neuroplasticity fundamentally involves learning new things, gaining new skills, and restructuring neural networks to create different patterns, fostering flexibility and fluidity.

Previously, it was also thought that brain cells could not regenerate, and cognitive decline was an inevitable part of aging. Fortunately, neuroplasticity research revealed that new brain cells can indeed grow through a process called **neurogenesis**. Neurogenesis primarily occurs in the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for learning new things, storing long-term memories, and experiencing emotions.

## Protecting Existing Brain Cells (Neuroprotection)

While the brain can regenerate cells, it's essential to protect existing ones. The primary factors detrimental to brain cells and neurogenesis include:
*   Excessive stress.
*   Lack of adequate sleep, as sleep deprivation inhibits neurogenesis.
*   Oxidative stress from environmental factors, food, and other toxins.
*   Too many physical stressors without sufficient recovery.
*   Emotional turmoil and psychological traumas, which elicit a stress response similar to physical stressors.

To prevent brain cell death, stress management must be an active part of your routine.

### Neuroprotective Activities for Brain Cells:

*   **Spend time in nature:** Exposes mitochondria to negative ions that recharge cells.
*   **Limit exposure to environmental toxins:**
    *   Air pollution
    *   Heavy metals
    *   Contaminated water
    *   Mold in the home
    *   "Junk light"
*   **Avoid harmful substances:**
    *   Alcohol
    *   Tobacco
    *   Drugs
*   **Reduce sugar intake:**
    *   Sugar -> Glucose metabolism -> Decreased neurogenesis
*   **Consume flavonols and other antioxidants:** These protect the brain and body from oxidative stress.
    *   **Foods high in flavonols:** Colorful fruits, vegetables (especially berries like blueberries, cranberries, cherries), and dark chocolate.
*   **Practice meditation and mindfulness:** Improves sleep, reduces anxiety, and has been shown to increase gray matter size in the brain.
*   **Manage busyness:** Distinguish busyness from productivity; chronic busyness can lead to a stress response cycle that is difficult to break.

## Facilitating Neurogenesis Through Diet

Certain dietary interventions can significantly promote neurogenesis:

*   **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:**
    *   The Western diet is often omega-6 dominant, which promotes oxidation and inflammation. Adequate omega-3 consumption promotes neurogenesis and improves mental health.
    *   **DHA** is an omega-3 fatty acid crucial for the brain, improving cognition and potentially repairing cognitive decline.
    *   **Sources:** Fish oil, wild salmon, seafood.
*   **Resveratrol:** An antioxidant linked with longevity and anti-aging, also shown to affect neurogenesis.
*   **Turmeric:** Beneficial for neurogenesis, can help regenerate damaged brain tissue, and improve neurological disorders.
*   **EGCG (from green tea):** A compound linked to the growth of new brain cells.
*   **Ketogenic Diet:**
    *   The brain thrives on ketones, which have neuroprotective benefits and improve cognition.
    *   Ketones can provide up to 70% of the brain's energy demands after keto-adaptation and protect against oxidative stress.
*   **Caloric Restriction and Intermittent Fasting:**
    *   Beneficial for fat loss and longevity, and also for neurogenesis.
    *   Decreasing calories increases neurogenic hormones within the hippocampus.
    *   In rats, fasting has been shown to increase the proliferation of cells inside the hippocampus by 30%.

### Dietary Process Visualizations:

*   Sugar -> Glucose Metabolism -> Decreased Neurogenesis
*   Ketogenic Diet -> Ketones -> Provide up to 70% of brain's energy demands -> Neuroprotective benefits -> Protects against oxidative stress
*   Caloric Restriction / Intermittent Fasting -> Decreased Calories -> Increased Neurogenic Hormones (Hippocampus) -> Increased Cell Proliferation (e.g., 30% in rats)

## Facilitating Neurogenesis Through Lifestyle and Activities

Beyond diet, several activities can stimulate the growth of new brain cells:

*   **Sex:** Triggers the production of endorphins, which provide pleasure, improve mood and attention, and have been shown to increase neurogenesis.
*   **Exercising:**
    *   Unleashes endorphins, similar to sex.
    *   Increases Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a protein that stimulates the growth of new neurons and synapses.
    *   Exercise -> Endorphins -> Pleasure, Mood, Attention -> Increased Neurogenesis
    *   Exercise -> BDNF -> Stimulates growth of new neurons and synapses
*   **Exposure to Natural Sunlight:**
    *   Stimulates Vitamin D production in the body.
    *   Vitamin D is crucial for cardiovascular health and other metabolic processes, and it also increases BDNF.
    *   Natural Sunlight -> Vitamin D Production -> Increased BDNF
*   **Exercise in Enriched Environments:**
    *   Combine going outside with exercise in an environment rich with different, novel stimuli that grab your attention.
    *   **Examples:** Hiking in a forest, CrossFit, gymnastics, yoga, bouldering – activities that trigger both neurogenesis and neuroplasticity simultaneously.
*   **Learning New Things and Facing Novel Situations:** Increases neuroplasticity by forcing the brain to consciously utilize different neural pathways and create new connections, thereby growing new brain cells.

## Emerging Technologies for Neurogenesis

Modern technologies are exploring ways to directly stimulate brain cell growth:

*   **Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS):** Stimulates parts of the brain with a magnetic field generator, shown to increase hippocampal neurogenesis in rats.
*   **Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS):** Has been shown to increase homeostatic neuroplasticity with long-term effects.

## Maintaining New Brain Cells

Growing new brain cells is only part of the equation; maintaining them for life is equally important. The principle "what you don't use, you lose" applies to brain cells.

### Strategies for Maintaining Brain Cells:

*   **Introduce variety:** Vary your nutrition, routines, habits, and activities.
*   **Challenge yourself daily:** Engage in both physical and mental challenges to keep your brain sharper, more alive, more adaptable, and readily available for change.
*   **Incorporate mind-body exercises:** Activities like handstands or tumbling not only provide physical exercise but also demand intense mental focus, control, and present-moment awareness, training both body and mind simultaneously.
