# 2018-11-04 OURA Ring 2 Review 2018 - Is It Worth It

## Executive Summary
*   The Oura Ring 2 is a cutting-edge sleep tracking device that provides quantifiable data on sleep stages, recovery, heart rate, core temperature, and heart rate variability, offering insights beyond subjective perception.
*   Studies comparing the Oura Ring to traditional sleep labs indicate that it provides comparable accuracy for sleep data.
*   Consistency in sleep schedule, aligned with chronotype, is identified as the biggest driver for improved sleep health and quality.
*   The Oura Ring 2 boasts a significantly improved battery life, lasting over a week compared to the first generation's three days, with fast charging capabilities.
*   The device can be operated in airplane mode, minimizing EMF and Bluetooth signaling, making it a preferred option for users concerned about radiation during sleep.

## Oura Ring 2 Overview

The Oura Ring 2 is a sleep tracking device designed to measure various physiological metrics during sleep, including:
*   Time spent in different sleep stages (e.g., deep sleep, REM sleep).
*   Sleep recovery status.
*   Nighttime heart rate.
*   Core body temperature.
*   Heart rate variability (HRV).
*   Sleep onset latency (how fast you fall asleep).
*   Sleep efficiency.
*   Number of nighttime awakenings.

The device aims to provide users with quantifiable data that surpasses subjective feelings about sleep quality.

## Scientific Validation

*   **Sleep Lab Comparison:** The Oura Ring 2 has undergone studies comparing its performance against professional sleep labs. These studies have demonstrated that the Oura Ring provides data with accuracy comparable to that of a traditional sleep lab setup.
*   **Commercial Availability:** The Oura Ring is considered one of the most accurate commercially available sleep tracking devices for habitual use by the general population.

## Key Sleep Optimization Factors

*   **Consistency is Paramount:** The most significant factor for improving sleep health and achieving higher quality sleep is consistency. This involves maintaining a regular bedtime and wake-up time, ideally aligned with an individual's chronotype. The Oura Ring can assist in identifying an individual's chronotype through past sleep data analysis.
*   **Sleep Stages and Readiness:** The duration of deep sleep and REM sleep are highlighted as crucial indicators of sleep quality and readiness for the day ahead. Low physical preparedness or readiness, indicated by insufficient or poor-quality sleep, suggests that intense physical exertion or demanding mental tasks may be less effective or even detrimental due to insufficient nervous system recovery.

## Hardware and Battery Life Improvements

*   **Size and Design:** The second-generation Oura Ring is notably smaller and less conspicuous than its predecessor, making it more comfortable to wear and less noticeable compared to a standard ring.
*   **Battery Efficiency:** The Oura Ring 2 features enhanced energy efficiency. Its battery can last for over a week on a single charge, a significant improvement from the first-generation ring which lasted approximately three days.
*   **Charging Speed:** Both generations of the ring offer fast charging, with a full charge achievable in under an hour.

## Features and Usage

*   **Airplane Mode:** A key feature of the Oura Ring is its ability to operate in airplane mode. This mode allows the device to collect data without emitting Bluetooth or EMF signals, addressing concerns about radiation and potential sleep disruption. The device collects data offline and syncs when Bluetooth is re-enabled.
*   **Step Tracking:** In addition to sleep metrics, the Oura Ring also tracks daily steps, eliminating the need for separate fitness trackers like Fitbits for this specific function.

## Cost-Effectiveness and Value Proposition

*   **Price Point:** The Oura Ring 2 is priced at approximately $300.
*   **Perceived Value:** The speaker considers the price to be a small investment compared to the substantial value gained in terms of health optimization and performance enhancement. The device is described as "incredibly cost-efficient" and worth a significantly higher price.

## Potential Downsides

While generally reliable, the Oura Ring may experience occasional:
*   Bugs or software glitches.
*   Synchronization issues with the companion app.
*   Inaccuracies, though these are considered rare and less significant than the limitations of not having any sleep tracking data. The device is deemed a superior option to not using any sleep tracking technology.
