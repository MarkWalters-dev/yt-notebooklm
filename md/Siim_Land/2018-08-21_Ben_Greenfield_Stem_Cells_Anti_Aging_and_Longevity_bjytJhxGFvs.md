# 2018-08-21 Ben Greenfield Stem Cells Anti Aging and Longevity

## Executive Summary

*   Stem cell therapy, using autologous or allogeneic sources, can potentially enhance tissue repair, accelerate healing, and improve quality of life by replacing exhausted stem cells and addressing tissue damage.
*   Exosomes derived from placental stem cells, when combined with autologous bone marrow aspirate, have been used for full-body rejuvenation, including joint repair, cosmetic enhancement, and sexual function improvement.
*   Stem cell treatments, particularly IV infusions and targeted injections, have shown benefits in speeding up recovery from workouts and traumatic brain injuries, and potentially slowing telomere shortening, leading to a reduced biological age.
*   Fasting, particularly intermittent fasting, is a key driver of stem cell health by enhancing telomerase activity and endogenous stem cell production.
*   Longevity is significantly influenced by hormetic stressors (e.g., heat, cold, hunger, mild physical exertion) and reproductive usefulness or frequency of social interaction.

## Stem Cell Therapies for Anti-Aging and Longevity

### Stem Cell Theory of Aging
*   Aging is associated with the exhaustion of stem cells in tissue-specific niches.
*   Replacing these exhausted stem cells with autologous (from one's own body, e.g., bone marrow, fat) or non-autologous (umbilical, amniotic, placental) sources can improve quality of life as one ages.
*   Stem cells can also aid in tissue repair and recovery when injected into damaged areas, such as joints.

### Mechanisms of Stem Cell Action
*   **Direct Repair:** Stem cells can directly assist in the repair of damaged tissues.
*   **Blood-Brain Barrier Permeation:** Temporary permeability of the blood-brain barrier can be induced (e.g., with mannitol) to allow stem cells to cross and potentially work in neural tissue.

### Types of Stem Cell Procedures and Applications
*   **Umbilical and Amniotic Stem Cell Injections:** Used for disc adjustments and back work. Concerns exist regarding potential immune reactions or pathogen transmission due to them being foreign proteins.
*   **Placental Stem Cell Exosomes:**
    *   DNA in placental stem cells is killed.
    *   Cellular signaling molecules and exosomes are extracted.
    *   These exosomes are mixed with autologous bone marrow aspirate.
    *   **Applications:** Injected into joints, used for facial rejuvenation (mixed with Platelet-Rich Plasma - PRP), sexual enhancement (injected into the corpus cavernosum and head of the penis), and cosmetic treatments. This protocol is referred to as a "full body stem cell makeover."
*   **Autologous Stem Cell Storage:**
    *   Bone stem cells stored with Forever Labs.
    *   Fat stem cells stored with US Stem Cell Clinic.
*   **Stem Cell Use for Injury and Recovery:**
    *   **Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) / Concussion:** IV infusion with mannitol to aid brain healing, leading to increased clear-headedness.
    *   **Joint Injuries (Knee, Elbow):** Stem cells shipped and injected into affected joints for accelerated healing.
*   **Intravenous Stem Cell Infusions:** Administered for general anti-aging effects.

### Subjective Benefits of Stem Cell Therapy
*   **Accelerated Healing:** Noticeably speeds up recovery from injuries and workouts.
*   **Improved Recovery from Workouts:** Faster bounce-back from physical exertion.
*   **Cognitive Benefits:** Enhanced clear-headedness after TBI/concussion treatment.
*   **Sexual Performance:** Marked improvements in orgasm length and erection firmness.
*   **Telomere Lengthening:** Decreased rate of telomere shortening, contributing to biological age reversal.

### Wife's Experience with Stem Cells
*   **Sexual Enhancement:** Injections into the vagina and clitoris to counter aging effects.
*   **Facial Treatments:** Stem cell-based cosmetic procedures.
*   **Stem Cell Banking:** Own fat stem cells stored for potential future use.

## Promoting Stem Cell Health and Telomere Lengthening

### Enhancing Telomerase Activity
*   Various compounds can assist in enhancing telomerase activity, the enzyme responsible for maintaining telomere length.

### Increasing Endogenous Stem Cell Production
*   **Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) Therapy:**
    *   Can induce stem cell production from bone marrow in the femur when applied to long bones.
    *   Originally researched by NASA for stem cell availability.
    *   Various PEMF devices exist, including mats for overnight use (e.g., Body Balance by Dr. William Pollock) and powerful tables with coils and rings (e.g., Pulset Centers) for enhancing cell membrane function, inflammation removal, and metabolite exchange.
*   **Fasting:**
    *   **Intermittent Fasting (12-16 hours daily):** A foundational practice.
    *   **Weekly 24-hour Fasts:** Can be done from dinner to dinner.
    *   **Extended Fasting (3-5 days, 2-4 times a year):** Calorie restriction similar to Dr. Valter Longo's protocol (600-800 calories/day).
    *   **Ketone Esters and Essential Amino Acids:** Can be used during a fasted state, especially post-workout, without significantly disrupting ketogenesis or autophagy for exercise enthusiasts, as they are non-insulinogenic and can even stimulate ketone production.
*   **Sirtuin-Enhancing Compounds/Foods:**
    *   **Foods:** Blueberries, dark chocolate, resveratrol, green teas, blackcurrants, tannic foods, dark-colored foods.
    *   **Other Compounds:** Colostrum, chlorella, aloe vera, coffee berry fruit extract, curcumin.
    *   A smoothie incorporating these can enhance stem cell health.

## Longevity and Anti-Aging Diet

### Personalized Nutrition
*   Dietary recommendations are highly dependent on genetics (e.g., APOE gene variants influencing response to fats, CYP1A2 gene for caffeine metabolism, AMY1 gene for starch digestion).
*   High-fat ketogenic diets may not be suitable for everyone and can cause gut issues.
*   Mediterranean or "ketohban" style diets with healthy starches (sweet potatoes, yams, tubers) and monounsaturated fats are better for some individuals.

### Prevalent Dietary Characteristics in Longevity Hotspots (Blue Zones)
*   **Fasting/Caloric Restriction:** Consistent presence, regardless of macronutrient ratios.
*   **High Intake of Tannins, Antioxidants, and Mild Hormetic Stressors:** From wild plants, herbs, and spices.
*   **Absence of Processed and Packaged Foods:** And rancid vegetable oils.
*   **Social Eating:** Eating together in social situations.
*   **Meal Timing:** Light breakfasts, heavier lunches, moderate dinners finished well before bedtime, often followed by postprandial activity (e.g., a walk).
*   **Physical Activity Before Breakfast:** Common in some ancestral patterns.

### Gut Microbiome and Food Variety
*   A wide variety of foods, including "dirty foods" (foods with soil, fresh-harvested, fermented, or even containing mild parasites/helminths), supports a robust gut microbiome.
*   Many Westerners consume a limited range of foods, contributing to gut dysbiosis and autoimmune disorders.
*   Exposure to diverse microbiomes and microbes can enhance cellular and gut health.

### Addressing Extreme Diets (Carnivore, Vegan)
*   While some populations might show success with plant-based diets (e.g., Seventh Day Adventists), long-term thriving on all-meat diets is less documented.
*   Omnivorous diets, often with moderation in meat consumption, are common in long-lived populations.
*   Dogmatic dietary approaches are less ideal than an omnivorous diet rich in whole foods, plants, herbs, and spices, incorporating fasting and mindful meal timing.

### Food Cycling and Seasonality
*   **Feast/Famine Cycles:** Incorporating periods of very low-calorie intake.
*   **Seasonal Eating:** Consuming foods that are in season locally. This naturally aligns with periods of higher insulin sensitivity in summer (more fruits) and a need for warming, nutrient-dense foods in fall/winter (fermented foods, meats, fats).
*   Prioritizing local and seasonal produce over imported or out-of-season items is encouraged.
*   **Ancestral Living + Science:** Combining traditional practices with modern scientific advancements (e.g., ketone esters, amino acids) can be beneficial if done intelligently.

### Exercise for Longevity

*   **Focus on Low-Level Physical Movement Throughout the Day:** Mimicking ancestral lifestyles of gardening, building, and manual labor.
    *   Examples: Walking on a treadmill desk, lifting weights intermittently, doing pull-ups on a bar.
*   **Avoid Excessive High-Intensity Exercise:**
    *   CrossFit WODs, triathlon training, or prolonged intense workouts are not consistently seen in centenarian populations.
    *   Data suggests that exceeding 90 minutes of chronic cardio or 60 minutes of hard workouts can increase mortality risk.
    *   Hard workouts after prolonged sedentary periods can paradoxically increase cardiovascular risk.
*   **Hormetic Stressors in Exercise:** Include occasional heavy lifting, sprinting (e.g., running to the mailbox), or engaging in sports.
*   **Minimal Effective Dose:** Prioritize consistent, moderate movement over extreme training.

## Sleep and Circadian Rhythms

### Individual Circadian Variability
*   Some individuals naturally function better at night (night owls), while most align with a typical early-to-mid-night bedtime and morning wake time.

### Optimal Sleep Practices
*   **Bedtime:** Aim for 10:30 PM to maximize melatonin production, core body cooling, lymphatic drainage, and hormone production during sleep.
*   **Pre-Sleep Routine:** Avoid sympathetic nervous system-stimulating activities (including hard workouts) at least three hours before bedtime.
*   **Morning Routine:** Maximize exposure to morning sunlight/blue light upon waking.
*   **Evening Routine:** Minimize blue light exposure and maximize red light exposure.
*   **Sleep Cycles:** Aim for 4-6 sleep cycles per 24-hour period. Naps can supplement nighttime sleep.
*   **Sleep Environment:**
    *   **Temperature:** Cold environment (64-66°F / 18-19°C) is ideal. Devices like ChiliPad can help regulate bed temperature.
    *   **Darkness:** Absolute darkness is crucial.
    *   **Noise:** Minimize noise with earplugs or white noise machines on airplane mode.
*   **Bed Association:** Limit bed use to sleep and sex.

### Personal Habits for Longevity
*   **Fasting:** Adopting a more conscious approach to hunger signaling and meal timing. Understanding that fasting is not necessarily synonymous with caloric restriction.
*   **Mindful Eating:** Being cognizant of the types of foods consumed.

## Hormetic Stressors

*   Hormetic stressors are mild physical or environmental challenges that trigger adaptive responses, leading to increased resilience and health.
*   Examples include:
    *   Sunlight
    *   Heat (sauna)
    *   Cold (cold plunges)
    *   Hunger (fasting)
    *   Digestive stress (from diverse or novel foods)
    *   Physical exertion
    *   Exposure to certain plant compounds (tannins, polyphenols)

## Exercise and Longevity Data

*   Excessive high-intensity exercise may shorten lifespan.
*   Data suggests increased mortality risk when exceeding 90 minutes of chronic cardio or 60 minutes of hard workouts.
*   Structured, low-level physical activity throughout the day is favored over intense, infrequent bouts for longevity.
