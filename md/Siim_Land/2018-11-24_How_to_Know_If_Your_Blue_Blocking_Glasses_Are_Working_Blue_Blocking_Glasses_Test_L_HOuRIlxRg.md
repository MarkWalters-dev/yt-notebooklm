# 2018-11-24 How to Know If Your Blue Blocking Glasses Are Working Blue Blocking Glasses Test

## Executive Summary

*   Properly functioning red blue-blocking glasses will make blue and green light frequencies appear black, dark green, or brown.
*   Amber blue-blocking glasses generally block fewer blue light frequencies compared to red glasses, often leaving lighter blues and greens visible.
*   Several practical and online methods exist to test the efficacy of blue-blocking glasses, including direct visual checks and comparing light spectra.
*   Exposure to morning sunlight entrains the body's circadian clock, initiating a crucial cascade of hormone release that supports optimal physical and mental well-being.
*   Disrupted circadian rhythms due to inappropriate light exposure can lead to metabolic dysfunction, such as leptin and insulin resistance, and is linked to an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and dementia.

## Testing Blue-Blocking Glasses Efficacy

Testing your blue-blocking glasses is crucial to ensure they effectively filter out unwanted light frequencies.

### Blue Blocking Glasses Test Protocols

*   **Direct Visual Check (Red Lenses):**
    *   Put on your red or amber nighttime blue blockers.
    *   If you are still seeing any blue light through the red lenses, the glasses are not working correctly.
    *   When looking at blue colors through effective red lenses, the blue should appear black, a dark green, or a very dark color.
    *   Lighter blue colors or significant green may still be visible through orange/amber lenses, indicating less comprehensive blue light blocking compared to red lenses.

*   **Online Spectral Eradication Test:**
    *   Some websites feature specific patterns of blue/green light within circles.
    *   When viewed through effective blue blockers, the glasses should completely eradicate the visible blue/green pattern.

*   **Online Spectral Strip Comparison Test:**
    *   Search online for "testing blue blocker glasses" to find visual tests involving two strips of colors.
    *   These strips display a spectrum of colors, including different shades of blue, green, yellow, and amber. One strip shows the full spectrum, while the other is meant to appear uniformly dark/black when viewed through effective blue blockers.
    *   When wearing blue-blocking glasses, both strips need to appear identical (i.e., the 'disruption zone' where blue/green light is present in the unfiltered strip should appear completely blocked) for the glasses to be effective. Amber glasses may only block a portion of the blue spectrum, allowing some light in, whereas effective red blue blockers should block across the entire critical spectrum.

*   **Green Light "Football Pitch" Test (for Red Lenses):**
    *   Find a lush green football (soccer) pitch, either in person or on a television.
    *   Put on your red blue-blocking glasses.
    *   If the pitch still appears green and vibrant, your glasses are not working.
    *   If the pitch appears dry, brown, or unwatered (as if it hasn't rained for months), then your red blue blockers are effectively filtering green light, indicating proper function.

## Impact of Light on Health and Metabolism

Light plays a critical role as a master governor of hormones and overall health, extending beyond just sleep management.

### Circadian Rhythm and Hormone Cascade

Morning light exposure -> Entrains circadian clock -> Initiates cascade of hormone release throughout the day -> Optimizes body, maintains good shape, supports mental well-being.

### Consequences of Disrupted Light Exposure

Disrupted circadian rhythms and inappropriate light exposure can lead to a cascade of negative health outcomes:

*   **Initial Symptoms:** Feeling groggy in the mornings, increased evening chronotype preference, slumps during the day, general malaise.
*   **Long-Term Health Risks:**
    *   Development of leptin and insulin resistance, impacting brain and metabolic health.
    *   Increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and dementia.
*   **Fundamental Role of Light:** Light is a key regulator of metabolism and insulin sensitivity, making proper light hygiene essential for preventing chronic health issues.
