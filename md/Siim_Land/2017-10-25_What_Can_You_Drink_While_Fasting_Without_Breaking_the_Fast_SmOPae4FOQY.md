# 2017-10-25 What Can You Drink While Fasting Without Breaking the Fast

## Executive Summary

*   **Caloric Restriction is Key:** For intermittent fasting, all caloric intake must be avoided to maintain a fasted state.
*   **Beneficial Fasting Drinks:** Certain beverages like baking soda, globrous salt, herbal teas, coffee, and apple cider vinegar can be consumed during fasting and may enhance its effectiveness by promoting detoxification, gut cleansing, and ketosis.
*   **Autophagy and Calorie Thresholds:** Consuming fats (e.g., butter, MCT oil) or even small amounts of calories (estimated at 50 calories) can block the benefits of autophagy, the body's cellular self-digestion process, even if ketosis is maintained.
*   **Sweetener Caution:** Artificial sweeteners, even those without calories like stevia, can potentially trigger an insulin response or a "feared state" due to sweetness stimulation, thus possibly breaking the fast.
*   **Electrolyte and Mineral Importance:** Maintaining electrolyte and mineral balance is crucial during fasting due to water loss, and some allowed beverages (e.g., mineral water, baking soda, certain salts) can help replenish these.

## Understanding Fasting and Ketosis

During intermittent fasting, the body shifts into a mild ketosis when it enters a fasted state. This state:
*   Increases fat burning.
*   Reduces appetite.
*   Prevents the body from catabolizing itself.

The body adapts to the absence of food relatively quickly, with hunger levels showing minimal difference between fasting for 48 hours versus seven days.

## Allowed Beverages During Fasting

### Baking Soda (Sodium Bicarbonate)

*   **Benefits:**
    *   Aids digestion, relieving constipation and bloating.
    *   Eliminates parasites and bad bacteria.
    *   Reduces fatigue and muscle soreness.
    *   Neutralizes gut acidity and balances pH levels.
    *   Provides sodium, crucial for electrolyte balance during fasting.
    *   Can suppress appetite.
*   **Usage:** Consume one teaspoon in water to potentially boost physical performance and overall health.

### Globrous Salt (Sodium Sulfate Decahydrate)

*   **Benefits:**
    *   Acts as a mild laxative, triggering bowel movements.
    *   Helps remove constipation.
    *   Reduces bloating.
    *   Cleanses the digestive tract.
*   **Usage:** Add 5 to 20 grams to water. Exceeding this amount may cause diarrhea and dehydration.

### Herbal Teas

*   **Benefits:**
    *   Stave off hunger.
    *   Offer medicinal and detoxification benefits.
    *   **Chamomile:** Calms upset stomachs and aids sleep.
    *   **Peppermint:** Improves digestion, reduces inflammation and muscle pain.
    *   **Jasmine:** Strengthens the immune system, prevents diabetes, and lowers cholesterol.
    *   **Green Tea:** Rich in polyphenols for heart and brain health; small amount of caffeine boosts fat burning.
    *   **Black Tea:** Contains compounds beneficial for heart, digestion, and stress levels.
*   **Caloric Content:** Typically 1-5 calories per cup, generally not enough to break a fasted state.
*   **Caution:** Avoid teas brewed with fruits, berries, or seasonings containing carbohydrates, as sugars can inhibit autophagy.

### Coffee

*   **Benefits:**
    *   Effectively suppresses hunger.
    *   Caffeine provides energy and increases focus.
    *   Boosts fat burning.
    *   May improve blood sugar regulation.
    *   High polyphenol count.
    *   Associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease.
    *   Enhances mitochondrial and brain function.
*   **Usage:** Drink black coffee to avoid breaking the fasted state.
*   **Additives:** Small amounts of cinnamon or stevia may be permissible, but larger quantities or instant coffee mixers (often with added substances) should be avoided.
*   **Consumption Limit:** Limit to 2-4 cups per day to prevent caffeine intolerance and elevated cortisol levels (which can hinder ketosis).
*   **Decaf Coffee:** Potentially unlimited, though still contains some caffeine.

#### Bulletproof Coffee (Coffee with Fat)

*   **Composition:** Coffee with butter, coconut oil, or MCT oil.
*   **Effect:** Pure fats do not raise blood sugar, maintaining a "semi-fasted state." The brain may perceive it as not having eaten.
*   **Impact on Autophagy:** Most likely blocks the effects of autophagy, even with small amounts of fat (e.g., 50 calories).
*   **Purpose Consideration:**
    *   **Weight Loss:** May be beneficial if it helps sustain the fast and the overall caloric deficit is maintained.
    *   **Detoxification/Inflammation Reduction:** Advised to avoid all calories to allow autophagy to function fully.

### Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV)

*   **Benefits:**
    *   Antibacterial and anti-inflammatory compounds.
    *   Helps balance body pH levels.
    *   Contains minimal calories.
    *   Provides minerals like potassium, magnesium, and iron, aiding electrolyte balance.
    *   Kills bad gut bacteria.
    *   Staves off hunger.
*   **Usage:** Add 1-2 tablespoons to sparkling water.
*   **Autophagy:** This amount is unlikely to break autophagy.
*   **Breaking a Fast:** Can be used effectively to break a fast, especially with added lemon juice to promote digestive enzymes. Avoid lemon juice during the fast to prevent a placebo insulin response.

### Water, Sparkling Water, and Mineral Water

*   **Regular Water:** Essential for hydration.
*   **Sparkling Water:** A good alternative to plain water.
*   **Mineral Water:** Important for replenishing electrolytes.
*   **Salt Addition:** A pinch of sea salt or pink Himalayan rock salt can be added to water to provide sodium and iodine (from ionized rock salt), which supports thyroid function.

## Cautionary Notes on Sweeteners

*   **General Rule:** The impact of artificial sweeteners depends on the type, fasting goal, and individual body response.
*   **Sweeteners to Avoid:** Maltodextrin, dextrose, or sucralose, as they often contain carbohydrates.
*   **Natural Sweeteners (e.g., Stevia):**
    *   Do not typically raise insulin or blood sugar.
    *   **Potential Issue:** The intense sweetness can stimulate taste buds, potentially triggering a placebo-like insulin response or shifting the body into a "feared state."
*   **Recommendation:** For safety, it is best to avoid all sweeteners during a fast. If attempting to use them, experiment cautiously and observe individual reactions.

## Summary of Fasting Goals

When deciding what to consume during a fast, consider the primary goal:
*   **Weight Loss:** Beverages that help sustain the fast (even those with minimal calories like bulletproof coffee) may be acceptable if a caloric deficit is maintained.
*   **Detoxification and Inflammation Reduction:** Strict water fasting is recommended to allow autophagy to function optimally.
