# 2017-07-27 The Dark Side of Intermittent Fasting - How to Avoid the Negative Side Effects of Fasting

### Executive Summary

*   **Hypoglycemia Risk:** Initial fasting can lead to low blood sugar, exhaustion, and dizziness as the body adapts from glucose reliance to fat burning. Strategic hydration, electrolyte intake, and reduced carbohydrate consumption aid this transition.
*   **Muscle Preservation:** Although fasting is generally protein-sparing, initial periods, especially on high-carb diets, can increase gluconeogenesis. Preventing muscle loss involves avoiding caloric deficits during adaptation, ensuring adequate protein, and consuming sodium.
*   **Stress and Metabolic Rate:** While fasting can increase metabolic rate, it is also a bodily stressor. Combining fasting with other stressors (e.g., poor sleep, excessive exercise, chronic work stress) can elevate cortisol and adrenaline, negatively impacting hormones and metabolism. Intermittent and balanced fasting practices are essential.
*   **Digestive & Mood Issues:** Constipation, diarrhea, and mood fluctuations (grumpiness, lethargy) are common initial side effects. These can often be mitigated by increased water intake, electrolytes, fiber, and strategic use of caffeine or adjusting fast timing for social interactions.
*   **Binge Eating & Calorie Intake:** Challenges include difficulty consuming sufficient calories within a restricted window and tendencies for binge eating post-fast. Achieving fat adaptation (e.g., through a ketogenic diet) can significantly reduce hunger and improve appetite control.

## Hypoglycemia

When starting intermittent fasting, the body may not be accustomed to extended periods without food (typically longer than fourteen hours). This can lead to low energy, exhaustion, dizziness, and low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia). Hypoglycemia is uncomfortable and can be dangerous, as it starves the brain of glucose.

**Biological Process:**
Glucose Burning Metabolism -> No Carbs Available -> Energy Crisis -> Hypoglycemia

**Recommendations:**

*   Take things slowly during adaptation.
*   Rest during your fasting window.
*   Avoid extremely strenuous physical activity.
*   Drink more water to prevent hunger and additional stress.
*   Consume more electrolytes and sodium in food and water.
*   Lower carbohydrate intake to transition from a sugar-burning to a fat-adapted metabolism.

## Muscle Loss

Fasting generally does not burn muscle mass. Human growth hormone and ketones are protein-sparing, preserving lean tissue while increasing fat burning. However, initial periods of fasting, particularly on a high-carb diet, can be characterized by higher rates of gluconeogenesis.

**Recommendations to Avoid Muscle Loss:**

*   Rest and consume sodium.
*   Training in a fasted state can cause a greater anabolic response once eating resumes, supporting muscle building with sufficient protein and calories.
*   Avoid a caloric deficit when adapting to fasting; eat at maintenance.
*   Increase fat intake instead of carbs during the adaptation phase.
*   After a few weeks of consistent intermittent fasting, muscle loss is typically no longer an issue.

## Mood Drop

Despite potential mental clarity, fasting can sometimes lead to undesirable mood changes such as moodiness, grumpiness, avoidance, lethargy, exhaustion, and snappiness.

**Recommendations:**

*   A warm cup of coffee can provide energy and improve mood. Caffeine increases fat oxidation and releases adrenaline, which can alleviate mental fog.
*   Consider breaking your fast before or during social interactions to manage mood.

## Digestive Issues

Both constipation and diarrhea can occur as the body adjusts to fasting, but these are typically temporary.

**Recommendations for Constipation:**

*   Drink more water.
*   Consume apple cider vinegar.
*   Add more fiber to meals.
*   Consume more potassium and electrolytes.

**Recommendations for Diarrhea (after breaking fast):**

*   Eat some charcoal tablets.
*   Drink herbal teas.

## Calorie Intake Challenges During Restricted Windows

Some individuals find it difficult to consume all their required calories within a restricted feeding window (e.g., 4-8 hours), especially when eating whole foods (e.g., 3,000 calories).

**Recommendations:**

*   Shorten your fasting window.
*   Reduce activity levels. Avoid excessive cardio if calorie intake for recovery is already a struggle.
*   Align eating patterns to support training goals rather than exercising simply to eat more.
*   The body will adapt to eating larger meals within the fasting window over time.

## Binge Eating

Binge eating can be a significant issue for some people. While fasting, they may be perfectly fine, but upon breaking the fast, they overeat until uncomfortable, especially in the initial days. This often involves random food combinations, excessive sugar, fats, and sauces.

**Cause:**
This tendency is often due to the body's inability to efficiently burn fat for fuel yet. People who fast for three to five days often report a complete loss of hunger and sustained mental sharpness due to entering deep ketosis.

**Recommendations:**

*   Practice self-control and mindful eating.
*   A ketogenic diet can induce ketosis from day one, mimicking the physiology of fasting and reducing hunger.

## Metabolic Rate and Stress

Intermittent fasting does not inherently slow down metabolism; fasting for 48 hours can even increase metabolic rate by up to 14%. However, fasting is a physiological stressor. Elevated cortisol and adrenaline levels can negatively impact hormones and metabolism if combined with excessive existing stress.

**Sources of Excessive Stress:**
High workload, chronic negative self-talk, over-exercising (e.g., three hours a day), excessive screen time, and poor sleep.

**Recommendations:**

*   Do not fast for too long or too frequently.
*   If already performing daily 16-hour fasts, avoid adding additional long fasts (e.g., three-day fasts monthly) if other stressors are high.
*   The key is to integrate fasting intermittently and cautiously to avoid overwhelming the body's stress response.

## Micronutrient Deficiencies

Extended fasting (multiple days) can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients such as Omega-3s, magnesium, potassium, and vitamin B12. Even with a restricted eating window (e.g., one hour), it may be challenging to metabolize all necessary micronutrients.

**Recommendations:**

*   Prioritize nutrient-dense whole foods: green leafy vegetables, unprocessed meat, fish, eggs, and healthy fats.
*   Consider appropriate supplementation.
