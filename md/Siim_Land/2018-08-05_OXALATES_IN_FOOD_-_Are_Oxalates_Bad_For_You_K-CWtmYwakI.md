# 2018-08-05 OXALATES IN FOOD - Are Oxalates Bad For You

### Executive Summary

*   Oxalates are organic acids found in many plants that can bind to minerals like calcium and iron, potentially hindering their absorption and, in high amounts, decreasing bone density.
*   Excessive oxalate consumption is strongly linked to kidney stone formation, with approximately 80% of kidney stones being composed of calcium oxalates.
*   The health of the gut microbiome, particularly the presence of bacteria like *Oxalobacter formigenes*, is crucial for metabolizing oxalates and reducing their absorption by the body.
*   While some individuals (e.g., those with kidney stones, mineral deficiencies, or high uric acid) may need to limit oxalate intake, most people can consume oxalates in moderation, especially when paired with calcium-rich foods and proper preparation methods like cooking or soaking.
*   Long-term management of oxalate sensitivity should prioritize healing the gut and reducing inflammation rather than strict, perpetual oxalate elimination for the general population.

## What are Oxalates?

Oxalate, or oxalic acid, is an organic acid present in certain plants, including leafy green vegetables, spinach, some fruits, nuts, and seeds. Oxalates are also naturally synthesized in the body as a byproduct of normal metabolism and by red blood cells.

### Oxalate Formation in the Body

*   Incomplete oxidation of carbohydrates -> Oxalates
*   Metabolism of Vitamin C -> Oxalates
*   Conversion of amino acids like hydroxyproline -> Oxalates

### Impact on the Body

When consumed in large amounts, oxalates can have adverse effects:
*   They bind with calcium, iron, and other minerals, preventing their absorption.
*   High intake can decrease bone density due to reduced calcium absorption.
*   Combining oxalates with fiber can also hinder mineral absorption.
*   Excessive consumption is a primary cause of kidney stone formation, with about 80% of kidney stones being calcium oxalates.
*   Can lead to digestive issues.

*(Note: There are no scientific studies linking oxalates to autism.)*

## Dietary Sources of Oxalates

Many healthy foods contain oxalates. The amount can vary, but some commonly high-oxalate foods include:

*   **Leafy Greens:** Spinach, Swiss chard, kale, turnip greens, endive, beet greens
*   **Fruits:** Star fruit, rhubarb (leaves are higher in oxalates than the root)
*   **Vegetables:** Beetroot, okra, sweet potatoes
*   **Grains:** Buckwheat, amaranth
*   **Legumes:** Beans
*   **Nuts & Seeds:** Peanuts
*   **Other:** Cocoa powder
*   **Herbs & Spices:** Black pepper, parsley, cinnamon, turmeric

Foods high in Vitamin C can also contribute to the body's oxalate load due to its metabolism into oxalates.

## The Impact of Oxalates on Health

Oxalates are not inherently harmful but become problematic in large amounts. Many oxalate-rich foods, such as beetroot, turmeric, and cacao, are incredibly healthy and provide essential nutrients like magnesium and antioxidants. What truly matters is the total oxalate exposure and an individual's ability to process them.

### When to Consider Oxalate Restriction

It's advisable to assess your urine oxalate levels before severely restricting your diet. Conditions that may warrant minimizing oxalate consumption include:

*   History of kidney stones
*   Suffering from mineral deficiencies
*   High levels of uric acid in urine (though high protein intake can also raise uric acid)
*   Magnesium deficiencies, which increase susceptibility to kidney stone formation
*   Sulfur deficiencies, which can hinder oxalate processing and detoxification pathways

Plant-based diets tend to be higher in oxalates, which can sometimes correlate with calcium deficiencies in vegetarians if not managed carefully. Diets consistently low in calcium and other fat-soluble vitamins, or consistently high in oxalates, are not recommended long-term.

## Recommendations for Oxalate Management

For most individuals, complete avoidance of oxalates is unnecessary. The goal is to balance intake and support the body's natural processing mechanisms.

### Dietary and Preparation Strategies

*   **Increase Calcium Intake:**
    *   Consume calcium-rich foods like cheese, dairy, fish, and broccoli.
    *   Calcium binds with oxalates in the gut, reducing their absorption.
*   **Food Preparation:**
    *   **Cooking:** Slightly heating vegetables can lower the oxalate load by approximately 10-20%. Avoid overcooking to preserve other nutrients.
    *   **Soaking:** Soaking certain foods before eating can also reduce their oxalate content, making them easier to digest.

## The Gut Microbiome and Oxalate Metabolism

The ability to process oxalates and the body's reaction to oxalate-containing foods are highly dependent on gut health and the state of the microbiome.

*   **Beneficial Bacteria:**
    *   Certain bacteria, such as *Oxalobacter formigenes*, can significantly reduce the amount of oxalates absorbed by the body. They utilize oxalates for energy, thereby lowering the risk of kidney stone formation.
*   **Factors Impairing Beneficial Bacteria:**
    *   Antibiotics
    *   General inflammation in the gut
    *   Chronic diarrhea (can flush out *Oxalobacter formigenes*)
    *   Gastric bypass surgery (linked to higher urinary oxalate levels)

### Supporting Beneficial Gut Bacteria

*   **Fermented Foods:** Sauerkraut, raw kefir
*   **Animal Fats:** Butter, meat
*   **Healing Foods:** Bone broths, gelatinous meats, tendons (believed to support gut healing)

Ultimately, a healthy gut allows for easier metabolism of compounds like oxalates, gluten, lectins, and phytates. Many people's guts are compromised by factors such as chronic inflammation, stress, environmental toxins, inflammatory foods, circadian mismatches, poor lifestyle habits, and antibiotic use. Addressing these underlying gut health issues is a crucial step towards improving oxalate tolerance and overall well-being.

## Conclusion

If you do not have kidney stones or autoimmune disorders, moderate consumption of oxalates is generally safe. Individuals with inflammatory conditions may benefit from short-term oxalate elimination, but the long-term focus should remain on healing the gut and reducing systemic inflammation. The ultimate goal is to restore gut health to a point where the body can successfully metabolize a wide range of foods without adverse reactions, fostering freedom from dietary fears.
