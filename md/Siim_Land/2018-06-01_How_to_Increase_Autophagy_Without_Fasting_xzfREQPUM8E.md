# 2018-06-01 How to Increase Autophagy Without Fasting

*   Autophagy is a continuous process mediated by overall energy homeostasis; mild autophagy can be induced daily through strategic lifestyle choices without prolonged fasting.
*   Achieving mild autophagy involves depleting energy stores, suppressing mTOR (growth pathway), and upregulating AMPK (fuel sensor).
*   Key strategies include daily 18-20+ hour intermittent fasting, low-carb and moderate-calorie intake, targeted exercise (aerobic & resistance), and supporting lymphatic health.
*   Short periods of dry fasting (e.g., overnight dehydration) are highly effective for activating AMPK and boosting autophagy, potentially being three times more effective than water fasting.
*   Certain foods and compounds (e.g., coffee, turmeric, medicinal mushrooms) and hormetic stressors (e.g., heat saunas, cold baths) can stimulate autophagy and activate protective pathways like Nrf2.

## Understanding Autophagy

Autophagy is the cellular detoxification process that requires nutrient abstinence. Any type of energy from carbs, protein, fat, exogenous ketones, BCAAs, or fiber will inhibit autophagy to some degree.

To induce autophagy, the body needs to be in a depleted state for at least a day or more, characterized by:

*   Low liver glycogen
*   Suppression of the anabolic pathway mTOR (signals cell growth and replication)
*   Upregulation of AMPK (the fuel sensor released during energy deprivation and fat burning)

**Autophagy Induction Pathway:**
Low Liver Glycogen -> Suppress mTOR -> Upregulate AMPK -> Induce Autophagy

Autophagy is a matter of degree and occurs in different tissues all the time. Mild autophagy can be stimulated even while eating through specific foods, exercise, and heat saunas. The goal is to upregulate AMPK-boosting pathways (burning endogenous fuel) and suppress mTOR-boosting pathways (indicating abundant nutrients) to induce mild autophagy regularly.

Walter Longo's fasting mimicking diet can mimic fasting physiology and induce deep ketosis, potentially priming the body for autophagy, though it may not offer the deepest cellular cleansing of extended fasting.

While fasting for at least 72 hours is considered the surest way to ramp up autophagy significantly, it's not sustainable daily. However, it's possible to trigger mild autophagy and gain benefits without such extended fasts.

## Strategies for Mild Autophagy Without Extended Fasting

Here are methods to trigger mild autophagy:

### 1. Intermittent Fasting Duration

*   **Practice intermittent fasting daily:** Fast for a minimum of 18-20 hours. This primes the body to produce more ketones and deplete energy stores.
*   **Understand true fasting duration:** Actual fasting begins 6-8 hours *after* a meal, once digestion, nutrient absorption, and bloodstream clearance are complete. For example, an 8 PM dinner means fasting truly starts around 1-2 AM.
*   **Avoid shorter fasts for autophagy:** A 16:8 style fast is generally insufficient to trigger autophagy; it primarily restricts the feeding window and reduces caloric intake. An 18-20 hour "Warrior diet" style fast is recommended for mild autophagy.

### 2. Low Carb Diet & Liver Glycogen

*   **Maintain low liver glycogen:** Eat a relatively low-carb diet to keep liver glycogen stores low. High carbohydrate intake elevates mTOR, suppresses AMPK, and shuts down autophagy.
*   **Muscle glycogen vs. liver glycogen:** Muscle glycogen depletion through exercise is acceptable, and even some carb consumption to replenish muscle glycogen can occur while staying in ketosis. The focus for autophagy is low *liver* glycogen.
*   **Avoid excessive fruit:** Fruit rapidly replenishes liver glycogen without filling muscle glycogen, which can shut down the AMPK pathways.

### 3. Caloric Restriction / Moderate Calorie Intake

*   **Avoid high calorie/fat intake:** Overconsumption of calories, regardless of source (e.g., bulletproof coffee, steak, exogenous ketones), inhibits AMPK and suppresses autophagy by signaling abundant energy.
*   **Maintain caloric maintenance or deficit:** For longevity and fat burning, aim for caloric maintenance or a slight caloric deficit, as caloric restriction can increase autophagy.

### 4. Exercise (Aerobic & Resistance)

*   **Aerobic exercise:** Probably stimulates more autophagy than resistance training due to increased lymph flow.
*   **Resistance training:** Crucial for preserving lean muscle mass, especially when in a caloric deficit or fasted state, as autophagy is catabolic. Muscle is vital for longevity, insulin sensitivity, bone strength, and disease protection.
*   **Balance mTOR and autophagy:** Strive for a balance; maintaining muscle mass (which requires some mTOR activation) is often more beneficial for long-term health than excessive autophagy leading to muscle loss.

### 5. Autophagy-Boosting Foods & Compounds

Certain foods and compounds can activate AMPK and stimulate autophagy:

*   Coffee
*   Green tea
*   Turmeric
*   Ginger
*   Ginseng
*   Medicinal mushrooms
*   Adaptogenic herbs
*   Berberine
*   Elderberries

These substances often have a hormetic effect, activating the Nrf2 pathway (main antioxidant pathway) and contributing to an antifragile response, with autophagy being part of this benefit.

### 6. Lymphatic System & Detoxification

*   **Stimulate lymph flow:** Activities that stimulate the lymphatic system also contribute to autophagy by flushing out toxins. This includes:
    *   Sweating (exercise, hot yoga, heat/infrared saunas)
    *   Rebounding/bouncing
    *   Maintaining physical activity
*   **Detoxification aids:** Cleansing the body of accumulated waste materials and toxins can help trigger autophagy faster and accelerate entry into a fasted state. Examples include:
    *   Ice cold baths
    *   Coffee enemas
    *   Inversion tables
    *   Salt flushes
    *   Activated charcoal
    *   Spirulina
    
Depletion of the body's resources signals AMPK activation, thereby activating autophagy.

### 7. Insulin & Protein Management

*   **Suppress insulin and reduce protein intake:** Lowering insulin and protein consumption suppresses mTOR, which helps raise autophagy.
*   **Balancing anabolism and catabolism:** While extended high autophagy can be overly catabolic and lead to muscle loss, a "semi-autophagy" state is preferred. For muscle building after resistance training, deliberately increasing protein and amino acids (e.g., leucine, HMB, creatine) can stimulate mTOR.
*   **Buffer zone:** Combining daily semi-autophagy (through fasting, exercise, heat saunas, autophagy-boosting foods) with occasional anabolic phases allows for reaping benefits from both worlds.

### 8. Dry Fasting & Hydration Timing

*   **Effectiveness of dry fasting:** Dry fasting is highly effective for triggering autophagy and accelerating ketosis. It's considered theoretically three times more effective than water fasting, meaning one day of dry fasting could yield effects comparable to three days of water fasting.
*   **Mechanism:** While fasting, the body still needs to process the last meal. Water intake, though calorie-free, requires digestive effort. Restricting water intake, even for short periods (e.g., overnight), further primes AMPK and autophagy.
*   **Endogenous water production:** During fat burning, the body produces hydrogen molecules and water, so complete dehydration is not a concern even during short dry fasts.
*   **Overnight dehydration:** A simple approach is to stop drinking water after dinner and rehydrate in the morning with salts and water. This avoids disrupting sleep with bathroom breaks and activates the hormetic effect of mild dehydration.
*   **Electrolyte importance:** Ensure adequate electrolytes, minerals, and salts when rehydrating, as excessive plain water intake without minerals can lead to electrolyte loss and negative side effects.

## Daily Autophagy-Boosting Blueprint

Here is a recommended daily routine to maintain a more autophagy-boosting state without fasting longer than 24 hours:

*   **Overnight Dehydration:** Stop drinking water after dinner. Aim for a minimum of 12 hours of dehydration (e.g., from bedtime until morning rehydration). Avoid drinking anything throughout the night.
*   **Morning Rehydration:** Break the dry fast with hot water mixed with baking soda and pink Himalayan rock salt.
    *   *Benefits:* Baking soda promotes kidney health, removes blood acidity from fasting, may help with kidney stones, and has anticancer properties (potentially stimulating autophagy).
    *   Continue drinking water with pink Himalayan rock salt throughout the day to stay hydrated and balance electrolytes, preventing mineral loss.
*   **Intermittent Fasting:** Continue fasting for a minimum of 18 hours daily. On longer days, extend to 22 hours.
*   **Autophagy-Boosting Cocktail (when breaking fast):** If fasting for 18 hours, break the fast with an "AMPK Activated Autophagy Activator" cocktail.
    *   *Ingredients:* Turmeric, ginseng, ginger, rosemary, cinnamon, chaga mushroom, spirulina, raw cacao, salts, and more ginseng.
    *   *Bioavailability Enhancers:* Add black pepper, cayenne pepper, and a small amount of MCT oil or bone broth to promote nutrient absorption and slow digestion. This allows for "creeping in and out of autophagy."
    *   *Caution:* Avoid excessive fat or compounds to maintain a low-carb and low-calorie depleted state.
*   **Workout:** After the cocktail, perform high-intensity interval training (e.g., Tabata) followed by bodybuilding exercises.
*   **Low-Carb Keto Dinner:** In the evening, consume a low-carb, ketogenic dinner focusing on:
    *   **Sulforaphane-rich vegetables:** Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage (activates Nrf2).
    *   **Fermented foods:** For gut microbiome health.
    *   **Protein sources:** Eggs, fish, organ meats, red meat (for muscle growth).
    *   **Healthy fats:** Olive oil, MCT oil, bone broth, butter, sour cream.
    *   **Polyphenols and Flavonoids:** Consume plenty to trigger Nrf2 and stimulate autophagy.
