# 2016-11-27 Habit 6 Synergize 7 Habits of Highly Effective People Overview Part Seven

## Executive Summary

*   Synergy, defined as the whole being greater than the sum of its parts (1+1=3+), catalyzes creativity, cooperation, and novel solutions.
*   Effective interpersonal synergy requires prerequisite habits: "Think Win-Win" (Habit 4) and "Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood" (Habit 5).
*   The foundation for interpersonal synergy lies in intrapersonal synergy, built upon internal security derived from Habits 1, 2, and 3 (Proactivity, Beginning with the End in Mind, Putting First Things First).
*   The core principle of synergy is valuing mental, emotional, and psychological differences, recognizing that individuals perceive the world based on their own internal frameworks.
*   Synergy helps avoid negative energy, fosters win-win "third alternatives," enhances interpersonal communication, and is crucial for achieving common goals.

## What is Synergy?

Synergy is the essence of principle-centered leadership, catalyzing, uniting, and unleashing the greatest powers within people. It means that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts; one plus one equals three or more. Synergistic communication opens up the mind and heart to new possibilities, novel solutions, and unique perspectives that would otherwise remain hidden. It grants the collective spirit access to higher levels of creativity and cooperation.

## Prerequisites for Interpersonal Synergy

To introduce synergy into interactions, the starting points are Habits Four and Five:

*   **Habit 4: Think Win-Win**
*   **Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood**

Once these habits are established, a group can come to terms with a common goal. This involves collectively agreeing to subordinate old scripts and to write a new one, which creates excitement and makes everyone work on the same side of the problem.

## The Foundation: Intrapersonal Synergy

Covey believes that the key to interpersonal synergy is intrapersonal synergy, meaning synergy within oneself. The heart of this is embodied in the principles of Habits One, Two, and Three:

*   **Habit 1: Be Proactive**
*   **Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind**
*   **Habit 3: Put First Things First**

This foundation provides the internal security necessary to handle the risks of being open and vulnerable. By creating an environment of trust and safety, individuals feel secure enough to become extremely open about their ideas, leading them to build upon each other's thoughts and develop even greater insights.

## The Essence: Valuing Differences

Valuing the mental, emotional, and psychological differences between people is the essence of synergy. The key to valuing these differences is to realize that all people see the world not as it is, but as they are.

Seeking synergy allows individuals and groups to:

*   Avoid negative energy.
*   Come up with a "third alternative" that is win-win for everyone.
*   Handle interpersonal situations more effectively.
*   Encourage others to be open.
*   Exponentially increase creativity.
*   Achieve common goals more efficiently.

## Action Steps to Creating Synergy

Here are some actions to create more synergy in interactions:

1.  **Analyze Differing Perspectives:** Think about a person who sees everything completely differently than you. Try to figure out ways how those differences could be used as stepping stones to "third alternative" solutions.
2.  **Identify Sources of Irritation:** Make a list of people who irritate you. Consider if some of their values could lead to synergy if you had greater intrinsic security and valued their differences.
3.  **Target Teamwork Situations:** Identify a situation in which you desire greater teamwork and synergy. Determine what conditions would need to exist to support synergy, and what you can do to create those conditions.
4.  **Creative Disagreement Resolution:** The next time you have a disagreement or confrontation with someone, attempt to understand the concerns underlying that person's position. Address those concerns in a creative and mutually beneficial way.
