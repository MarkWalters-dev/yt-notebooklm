# 2019-05-13 Chris Masterjohn on Fixing Nutrient Deficiencies and Structuring a More Robust Diet

## Executive Summary

*   **Dietary Diversity for Robustness:** Viewing one's diet as an economic portfolio of nutrients, diversification across animal and plant foods, organ meats, and muscle meats makes the diet more robust to errors, both in planning and in physiological nutrient utilization.
*   **Individual Nutritional Variability:** Individual nutrient needs are highly variable due to genetics, metabolic conversion efficiency (e.g., Vitamin A, B6, essential fatty acids), and physiological states, making a generalized approach to diet less effective. Needs also change over time.
*   **Challenges of Restrictive Diets:** Highly restrictive diets like vegan, carnivore, or paleo reduce dietary diversity and increase the need for meticulous planning and potential supplementation to avoid deficiencies in specific nutrients (e.g., B12, carnitine, cholesterol in vegan; Vitamin C, manganese in carnivore; calcium, molybdenum in paleo).
*   **Hormetic Effect of Plant Phytonutrients:** Plant phytonutrients, initially recognized as toxins by the body, can trigger a beneficial "hormetic" response at low, physiological concentrations, upregulating broad cellular defenses against various stressors, including modern synthetic chemicals.
*   **Fasting for Cleanup and Efficiency:** Fasting promotes a critical cycle of cellular cleanup and repair (autophagy), enhancing metabolic efficiency. This "lean time" prepares the body for more productive "feeding times," but it must be balanced with adequate nutrient intake to avoid depletion.

## Introduction to Nutritional Science

Chris Masterjohn's interest in nutrition stemmed from observing his mother's recovery from fibromyalgia through diet and lifestyle changes. His personal health declined significantly on a vegan diet, experiencing dental issues (two root canals, over a dozen cavities) and severe mental health problems (anxiety disorders escalating to panic attacks).

A pivotal point was discovering Weston Price's work, which detailed traditional diets. Price observed that populations consuming 'displacing foods of modern commerce' (white flour, sugar, syrups, canned goods, white rice) experienced widespread chronic degenerative diseases and tooth decay. In contrast, isolated populations immune to tooth decay prioritized nutrient-dense foods, especially those rich in fat-soluble vitamins. These included:

*   Organ meats and egg yolks (liver, heart, kidney)
*   Full-fat dairy products
*   Animal life of the sea (fish, especially shellfish)
*   Insects and small animals (consuming entire organisms)

Incorporating these nutrient-dense animal foods into his diet resolved both his dental issues and, notably, his severe mental health problems.

## Individual Nutritional Variability and Vegan Diets

Many people struggle with vegan diets due to individual differences in nutrient metabolism and synthesis:

*   **Nutrient Conversion Challenges:**
    *   **Vitamin A:** Plant-based carotenoids must be converted to retinol, the active form. Genetic variation, thyroid hormones, other nutrients, and digestive health significantly impact this conversion efficiency. Some individuals are poor converters.
    *   **Vitamin B6 and Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3/6):** Similar principles apply; metabolic conversions are required from plant forms, and genetic variations can hinder efficiency.
*   **Physiologically Essential but Non-Dietary Essential Nutrients:**
    *   **Carnitine:** Found exclusively in animal products, carnitine is physiologically essential. While the body can synthesize it, individuals poor at synthesis become dependent on dietary sources. Deficiency can lead to energy problems, exercise intolerance, or mental health issues.
    *   **Cholesterol:** Highly demonized, but 1-3% of the population struggles with endogenous cholesterol synthesis, leading to very low levels if not consumed. This can cause severe neurological problems, as the brain contains 25% of the body's cholesterol despite being only 2% of body weight.
*   **Observational Data:** Studies consistently show higher rates of mental health problems in vegetarians and vegans compared to omnivores. While personality traits (e.g., perfectionism leading to extreme diets) might play a role, nutritional factors are also significant, especially for those with suboptimal metabolic conversion abilities.
*   **Vitamin B12:** While stores can last up to 30 years with high intake (e.g., from clams, oysters, liver), most people do not have such reserves. Digestive disorders further impair absorption. Therefore, pre-existing low stores combined with a diet lacking B12 can lead to deficiency over time.

## Dietary Diversity, Robustness, and Planning

A diet can be conceptualized as an economic portfolio of nutrients.

*   **Diversification for Robustness:** Diversification across various food types (animal vs. plant, organ vs. muscle meats, different types of plant foods) makes the diet more resilient to errors in planning or individual physiological variations in nutrient utilization.
*   **Restrictions Increase Planning Needs:** The more a diet restricts food groups (e.g., vegan, carnivore, paleo), the less diverse it becomes, and the more meticulous planning is required to compensate for these restrictions. This planning must account for both errors in diet construction and individual physiological limitations.
*   **Example: Vitamin A Robustness:** Consuming four ounces of liver weekly can cover Vitamin A needs, irrespective of an individual's beta-carotene conversion efficiency. In contrast, relying solely on carrots makes individual conversion ability a critical factor in preventing deficiency.
*   **"Properly Planned Diets":** The statement that "properly planned vegan diets can be healthy" acknowledges that veganism imposes restrictions that necessitate specific, careful planning to mitigate the loss of inherent dietary robustness. This planning must also consider individual physiological needs.

## Nutrient Density and Superfoods

Focusing on highly nutrient-dense "superfoods" offers significant advantages:

*   **Maximizing Nutrient Intake:** Incorporating small amounts of superfoods (e.g., clams, oysters, liver) can efficiently cover essential nutrient requirements without excessive caloric intake. For instance, consuming one oyster, one clam, and half an ounce of liver daily can fully cover needs for zinc, copper, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin A (even for poor converters).
*   **Dietary Freedom:** When superfoods meet baseline nutrient needs, it provides greater flexibility and "room" in the rest of the diet for less nutrient-dense foods (e.g., occasional desserts or added fats) without compromising overall nutritional status.
*   **Example: Riboflavin:** Liver is by far the richest source of riboflavin. Without such superfoods, achieving adequate riboflavin from a diverse plant-based diet might require extremely strict adherence, severely limiting caloric intake from less nutrient-dense foods.

## Assessing Nutritional Status

Generalized data on nutrient deficiencies can be misleading, as biochemical markers often contradict survey data.

*   **Limitations of Survey Data:** NHANES survey data on common nutrient deficiencies (e.g., riboflavin) may not accurately reflect actual biochemical status. A study in Britain found 45% of adults and 75% of teenagers were biochemically deficient in riboflavin, despite survey data suggesting low rates of deficiency.
*   **Individualized Approach:** Nutritional assessment should be highly individualized, especially for those following specific health-conscious diets (e.g., vegan, paleo, keto, carnivore) whose nutrient profiles differ significantly from the general population.
*   **Assessment Methods:**
    *   Comprehensive laboratory analysis (if resources allow).
    *   Targeted laboratory analysis for critical decisions (when budget is limited).
    *   Dietary analysis using apps like Cronometer.
    *   Analysis of signs and symptoms of nutrient deficiencies.

## Key Nutrients and Dietary Patterns

### Vitamin D

*   **Primary Source:** Sunlight exposure.
*   **Influencing Factors:** Indoor living, distance from the equator, skin color (darker skin requires more time), and time of day (closer to noon is better at temperate latitudes).
*   **Optimizing Synthesis:** For maximum Vitamin D, full-body sunbathing for 10-30 minutes, flipping sides, is more effective than brief exposure of hands and face while standing.

### Specific Dietary Concerns

*   **Veganism:** Concerns include Vitamin A (conversion), Vitamin B6 (conversion), essential fatty acids (conversion), carnitine, cholesterol, and Vitamin B12.
*   **Carnivore:** Potential deficiencies in Vitamin C and manganese.
*   **Paleo:** Potential calcium deficiency (due to dairy exclusion) and molybdenum deficiency.
    *   **Molybdenum and Sulfite Accumulation:**
        High Meat Intake (high sulfur amino acids)
        -> Increased Molybdenum Need
        -> Low Legume Intake (primary molybdenum source in many diets)
        -> Molybdenum Deficiency
        -> Sulfite Accumulation (can cause allergy-like reactions)

### Dynamic Nature of Individual Needs

Nutritional needs are not static; they change significantly over time. It's crucial not to generalize past successful dietary interventions to future needs.

*   **Example: Iron and Hemochromatosis:** A woman with genetic predisposition to hemochromatosis (iron overload) might experience chronic iron-deficiency anemia for decades due to heavy menstrual flow, finding relief by increasing iron intake. Upon menopause or cessation of heavy bleeding, her iron needs reverse, and iron accumulation becomes the problem. Continuing to increase iron based on past experience would worsen her condition. This highlights the importance of re-evaluating needs as life stages and physiological conditions change.

## Hormesis and Plant Phytonutrients

Phytonutrients are naturally occurring plant toxins that humans have evolved to handle.

*   **Phytonutrient Metabolism:**
    Consume Phytonutrients (e.g., EGCG in green tea)
    -> Intestine actively limits absorption (only ~1% absorbed)
    -> Liver detoxification system tags and metabolizes them (as if foreign/toxic)
    -> Circulate in blood as detoxified, excretable forms
    -> Rapid excretion (completely eliminated within ~24 hours)
*   This process differs significantly from nutrient metabolism, where nutrients are actively absorbed and stored.
*   **Hormetic Effect:** At low, physiologically relevant concentrations, these "toxins" trigger a beneficial stress response. They increase the body's general cellular defenses, including antioxidant systems, making the body more resilient to a wide range of toxins, both natural and synthetic (e.g., from pollution).
*   **Distinguishing Hormesis from Harm:** Not all toxic substances are hormetic in a beneficial way. Cigarette smoking, for instance, is hormetic (increases glutathione production), but its overall toxicity outweighs any potential benefits; no safe or beneficial dose has been identified.
*   **Fruits and Vegetables:** General population data indicates a positive correlation between increased fruit and vegetable intake and improved health, with no obvious upper limit of harm.

## Fasting: Cleanup, Repair, and Economic Analogy

Fasting, like exercise, creates an energetic deficit that triggers adaptive responses in the body.

*   **Core Principle:** Fasting is primarily a cycle of cellular cleanup and repair, distinct from the feeding phase of rebuilding and rejuvenation.
*   **Fasting Phase (Lean Times):**
    *   Optimizes for resource efficiency.
    *   Increased autophagy: Breaking down old, dysfunctional, or inefficient cellular components to generate fuel and clear cellular clutter.
    *   Metabolic "economizing": Similar to a business cutting expenses and streamlining operations during tight financial times.
*   **Feeding Phase (Abundance):**
    *   Optimizes for investment in growth, repair, and rebuilding.
    *   Similar to a business reinvesting profits during good times to enhance productivity and growth.
*   **Importance of Cycling:**
    *   Constant feeding without fasting leads to cellular "bloat" and inefficiency, like a business that never audits its spending.
    *   Constant fasting without adequate feeding leads to depletion and breakdown without repair.
*   **Economic Analogy:** In business, cycling through lean periods (forcing efficiency and critical evaluation) and abundant periods (allowing strategic, productive investment) leads to far greater long-term productivity and resilience. This translates to the human body's operational efficiency, impacting sleep, physical performance, and overall well-being.
*   **Caution:** The ultimate end-game of fasting is starvation. While beneficial in cycles, over-obsessing or excessive fasting can lead to harmful breakdown without sufficient rebuilding. The purpose of fasting is to prepare the body for more effective nutrient utilization when *fed well*.
