# 2019-03-25 Dry Fasting VS Water Fasting Autophagy 3x Times the Effects

## Executive Summary
*   Dry fasting provides the benefits of water fasting but may offer an additional boost in autophagy due to cellular dehydration inhibiting mTOR and raising AMPK.
*   Dry fasting leads to the creation of deuterium-depleted metabolic water via beta-oxidation, which potentially promotes mitochondrial function better than deuterium-rich water consumed during water fasting.
*   Dry fasting may accelerate the onset of autophagy (potentially by 24 hours) compared to water fasting (potentially by Day 2).
*   Dry fasting is suggested to burn toxins for fuel within the cell, potentially avoiding the systemic detox symptoms associated with toxin mobilization into the bloodstream during water fasting.
*   While beneficial for maximizing autophagy quickly, dry fasting carries higher stress (cortisol/glucagon) and requires meticulous rehydration protocols.

## Autophagy and Fasting Mechanisms

Dry fasting is an advanced form of fasting involving abstention from both calories and liquids.

### Cellular Stress and Autophagy Activation
The body gains necessary water during dry fasting through cellular metabolism, specifically **beta-oxidation** (fat burning).

1.  **Fat Breakdown:** Triglycerides in adipose tissue are broken down.
2.  **Glycerol Release:** Glycerol (the backbone of triglycerides) is released.
3.  **Metabolic Water Production:** Beta-oxidation releases hydrogen atoms from glycerol, creating metabolic water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$).

This process induces cellular dehydration, which leads to the following signaling cascade:
Cell Dehydration -> Inhibits $\text{mTOR}$ signaling + Raises $\text{AMPK}$ -> Increased Autophagy

The resulting increased energy stress activates autophagy. Cortisol and glucagon may be elevated during dry fasts, forcing the breakdown of endogenous fuel, leading to increased fat oxidation and potentially enhanced autophagy through cellular turnover.

### Deuterium Depletion and Mitochondria
Metabolic water produced during beta-oxidation is **deuterium depleted**.

*   **Deuterium ($\text{D}$):** An isotope of hydrogen weighing twice as much.
*   **Impact:** Deuterium is "heavy" and does not pass through the ATPase pump as easily as standard hydrogen, potentially clogging the system and lowering mitochondrial energy efficiency.
*   **Water Fasting:** Consumption of regular water (tap, bottled, stream), which is high in deuterium, can increase the body's deuterium content.
*   **Dry Fasting/Ketosis:** Dry fasting and ketogenic diets deplete the body of deuterium due to beta-oxidation and ketosis.

### Cancer and Cell Turnover
Water fasting is known to suppress carcinogenesis due to autophagy and starvation. Dry fasting potentially speeds up the demise of cancerous cells by withholding water from them.

## Study Observations and Comparisons

### Study on Dry Fasting Safety
A five-day dry fast in 10 healthy subjects was found to be safe and resulted in:
*   Improved renal function.
*   Decreased body weight.
*   Decreased body circumferences.

Short, voluntary periods of dehydration via dry fasting may strengthen the body through **hormesis** and promote fat adaptation.

### Autophagy Onset Comparison
The effectiveness of dry fasting in initiating autophagy is accelerated compared to water fasting:

*   **Water Fasting:** Autophagy onset expected around Day 2 (after two days without calories).
*   **Dry Fasting:** Autophagy onset expected within 24 hours, potentially achieving the same effects faster.

The effect of dry fasting is estimated to be at least double, and possibly three times, that of regular water fasting for accelerating autophagy.

### Dry Fasting vs. Water Fasting Summary

| Feature | Dry Fasting Benefits | Dry Fasting Negatives | Water Fasting Benefits | Water Fasting Negatives |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Autophagy** | More effective/faster onset | Increased stress | Useful for longer fasts | Requires longer duration to onset |
| **Fat Burning** | Enhanced fat burning | Causes dehydration | Allows for more exercise | May cause electrolyte loss |
| **Toxin Mobilization** | Burns toxins *within* the cell, potentially avoiding systemic detox symptoms | Higher cortisol/glucagon levels | Toxins released into bloodstream, excreted via liquid routes | Potential for noticeable detox symptoms |
| **Metabolism** | Creates deuterium-depleted water | Limited physical exercise allowed | Maintains hydration and skin elasticity | Tendency to urinate more often |
| **Recovery** | Requires careful, proper rehydration | Risk of damage from chronic dehydration (wrinkles/skin damage) if rehydration is poor | Easier recovery | Electrolyte supplementation recommended (pure water fasting is discouraged) |

### Skin Healing
Dry fasting may heal damaged or unhealthy skin more effectively than water fasting due to higher autophagy levels and increased oxidation of toxins stored beneath the skin. However, practitioners must ensure proper rehydration post-fast to mitigate the risk of chronic dehydration leading to wrinkles.

## Conclusion
While prolonged dry fasting for a few days may maximize autophagy quickly and effectively, it is not necessary to perform constantly due to potential side effects. Both dry fasting and water fasting protocols are valuable tools to be implemented depending on the individual's goals and circumstances.
