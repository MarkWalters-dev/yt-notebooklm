# 2018-04-01 How to Boost Stem Cell Growth Naturally - MEL GIBSON STEM CELL HACKS

### Executive Summary

*   **Vitamin B3 (Niacin) Benefits:** Studies in older mice show Vitamin B3 revitalizes stem cells, leading to muscle regeneration, brain and skin cell growth, increased energy, improved insulin sensitivity, and extended lifespans.
*   **NAD+ Optimization:** Boosting NAD+ levels is critical for mitochondrial efficiency and healthy aging. This can be achieved through caloric restriction, carbohydrate depletion, states of ketosis, exercise, and cold/heat exposure.
*   **Intermittent Fasting:** Fasting not only elevates NAD+ levels but also directly triggers stem cell activity, regulates stem cell populations, reduces damage in bone marrow stem cells, and protects against chemotoxicity.
*   **Turmeric's Role:** The bioactive compound aromatic turmerone in turmeric (curcumin) is effective in inducing neural stem cell proliferation and possesses anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties.
*   **Spirulina for Stem Cell Genesis:** In mice studies, Spirulina promoted new and stronger stem cell genesis, protected against declines in neurostem proliferation, and provided essential omega-3 fatty acids beneficial for neural health.

### Introduction to Stem Cells and Natural Growth

Stem cell therapy involves procedures such as bone marrow transplants, umbilical cord blood injections, and somatic cell nuclear transfers, where young stem cells are introduced into the body to exert a rejuvenating effect. However, the human body also naturally produces stem cells, which are primarily stored in the reserves of the bone marrow and fat tissue.

With age, the body's natural stem cell populations decline and become less effective. This degradation is linked to overall joint health and, critically, the health of the mitochondria. Mitochondria are tiny organelles within cells responsible for producing the body's energy. If mitochondria are sluggish, it leads to increased fatigue and exhaustion, impacting all cellular functions, including stem cell activity. Therefore, boosting the body's natural stem cell production is directly tied to promoting optimal mitochondrial functioning.

### Strategies to Boost Natural Stem Cell Growth

## Vitamin B3 (Niacin)

Studies on older mice demonstrated that Vitamin B3 (niacin) revitalized their stem cells. Niacin is an essential nutrient crucial for energy production and metabolism. Mice receiving niacin exhibited significant anti-aging effects, including muscle regeneration, growth of brain and skin cells via enhanced stem cell activity, and substantially longer lifespans compared to control groups.

Another study provided Vitamin B3 to a group of mice for three to four months, resulting in increased energy, reduced weight, and improved insulin sensitivity. These mice could also run 33% longer than those not receiving the vitamin.

**Dietary Sources of Niacin:**
*   Fish
*   Poultry
*   Meat (e.g., beef)
*   Mushrooms
*   Organ meats
*   Peanuts
*   Sunflower seeds
*   Coffee
*   Tahini
*   Fortified cereals
A Vitamin B3 supplement can also be considered.

## Boost NAD+ Levels

Vitamin B3 contributes to the production of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+), a molecule essential for transferring calories into the mitochondria, where they are converted into ATP (cellular energy). NAD exists in two forms: NAD+ and NADH.

Low levels of NAD+ are associated with negative health outcomes such as brain degeneration, inflammation, increased body fat, fatigue, and muscle loss. Conversely, excessive energy intake from dietary sources can elevate NADH levels. This elevation can prevent the body from efficiently using its own stored fat for fuel, thereby making the mitochondria less efficient.

**NAD+/NADH Pathway:**
High dietary energy intake → Elevated NADH levels → Impaired utilization of stored fat for fuel → Decreased mitochondrial efficiency

**Methods to Increase NAD+ Levels:**
*   **Caloric Restriction:** Limiting calorie intake.
*   **Carbohydrate Depletion:** Reducing carbohydrate consumption.
*   **States of Ketosis:** Promoting fat burning for fuel by mitochondria.
*   **Exercise:** Physical activity.
*   **Cold/Heat Exposure:** Exposure to extreme temperatures.

## Intermittent Fasting

Fasting is a potent strategy that not only boosts NAD+ levels but also directly triggers stem cell activity. Prolonged fasts have been shown to regulate stem cell populations, even independently of chemotherapy. Furthermore, fasting can reduce damage to bone marrow stem cells and offer protection against chemotoxicity.

## Turmeric (Curcumin)

Turmeric, through its bioactive compound curcumin, contains aromatic turmerone, which can induce neural stem cell proliferation. Beyond this, turmeric exhibits numerous anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties that contribute to the creation of new brain cells and reduce oxidative stress throughout the body.

## Spirulina and Algae

Spirulina, a type of algae, has shown significant benefits for stem cell health. In studies where mice were fed spirulina for 28 days, they developed new and stronger stem cells. Spirulina promotes stem cell genesis and protects against declines in neurostem proliferation. Both spirulina and chlorella also contain small amounts of omega-3 fatty acids (DHA and EPA), which are vital for brain health and cognitive function, suggesting a broader positive impact on the body's cellular systems.

### The Critical Role of Mitochondria

Maintaining optimal mitochondrial health is fundamental for overall health and longevity. Aging and the development of many diseases are largely attributed to mitochondrial degeneration.

**Causes of Mitochondrial Degeneration:**
*   Poor lifestyle choices
*   Chronic stress
*   Persistent inflammation
*   Exposure to environmental toxins
*   Inadequate physical exercise

Therefore, to live a long, active, and youthful life, prioritizing and taking care of mitochondrial health is paramount.
