# 2018-08-30 Did You Screw Up Your Fast - 8 Things That Mess Up Intermittent Fasting

## Executive Summary

*   Excessive stress, whether from the fasting itself or external factors like anxiety, can lead to increased cortisol, potentially causing muscle loss and hindering metabolic health.
*   Consuming certain beverages, including too much coffee or anything with more than 20 calories, can break a fast and negate its benefits, particularly for autophagy and longevity.
*   Artificial sweeteners, despite being calorie-free, can negatively impact the gut microbiome, increase hunger, and potentially disrupt blood sugar and insulin levels, thus breaking a fast.
*   Not fasting for a sufficient duration (ideally 20+ hours) means missing out on key benefits like stem cell growth and significant autophagy.
*   Fasting too frequently or for excessively long periods can lead to metabolic slowdown and diminish the body's ability to handle stress effectively.
*   Combining severe caloric restriction with intermittent fasting can significantly decrease metabolism and negatively impact longevity.
*   To counterbalance the catabolic effects of fasting, it's crucial to stimulate anabolic growth processes by consuming sufficient calories, particularly protein and amino acids, during feeding windows.

## 1. Fasting Causes Too Much Stress

Fasting is a physiological stressor that triggers catabolism (breakdown of energy molecules like fat and glycogen) and cellular turnover. Cortisol, the primary stress hormone, aids in mobilizing energy stores. However, excessive cortisol can lead to:

*   **Being kicked out of ketosis:** Disrupting the fasted state.
*   **Stopping autophagy:** The cellular "clean-up" process.
*   **Muscle loss:** Resulting in a "skinny fat" physique.
*   **Thyroid dysfunction:** The thyroid gland is sensitive to stress hormones (glucocorticoids); excessive levels can lead to a lowered metabolism.

To mitigate this, fasting should be kept low-stress. Strategies include:

*   **Hydration and Electrolyte Balance:** Drinking salted water or broth can reduce physiological stress.
*   **Stress Management:** Practices like meditation, mindful breathing, and foam rolling can improve the body's ability to handle stress. Worry and anxiety can also increase cortisol.

## 2. Drinking Too Much Coffee

Coffee is a stimulant that releases cortisol and adrenaline. While moderate amounts can enhance fat mobilization and autophagy, excessive consumption can:

*   **Overstimulate Cortisol:** Leading to catabolism and potential muscle loss.
*   **Adrenal Fatigue:** Depleting adrenal gland resources.
*   **Desensitization to Caffeine:** Requiring more caffeine to achieve the same energizing effect.

**Recommendations for Coffee Consumption:**

*   **Timing:** Avoid coffee immediately upon waking, as natural cortisol levels are already high. Wait a few hours to allow the body's natural cortisol production to normalize.
*   **Quantity:** Limit to one to three cups per day.
*   **Avoid Afternoon Caffeine:** To prevent sleep disruption.
*   **Recognize Overconsumption:** Symptoms include feeling tired after drinking coffee, anxiety, jitters, or tunnel vision.

## 3. Adding Ingredients to Coffee

Adding anything beyond black coffee can break a fast, depending on the fasting goal:

*   **Fat Loss/Ketosis:** Small amounts of cream, butter, or MCT oil may not significantly interfere.
*   **Autophagy/Longevity:** Any significant calorie intake will stop autophagy.
    *   Coffee itself has about 5 calories.
    *   More than 20 calories can interfere with autophagy.
    *   Pure fats (like MCT oil or butter) in small quantities may allow mild autophagy and keep you in ketosis and maintain low blood sugar and liver glycogen.
*   **Milk:** Is highly anabolic and contains growth factors (IGF-1, mTOR) that directly oppose fasting and autophagy. Bulletproof coffee (with MCT oil/butter) is a better option than coffee with milk or cream.

## Artificial Sweeteners

Artificial sweeteners can also disrupt a fast:

*   **Caloric Content:** Despite labels, they contain a small number of calories.
*   **Blood Sugar/Insulin Spikes:** Can break ketosis and autophagy, leading to catabolism.
*   **Cravings and Hunger:** Stimulate gut receptors, tricking the body into expecting food and increasing hunger.
*   **Microbiome Disruption:** Can promote bacteria that are efficient at extracting calories, leading to increased calorie absorption from consumed food.

## 4. Taking Supplements

Most supplements can break a fast because they are essentially food in pill form.

*   **Caloric Content/Blood Sugar Spikes:** Some ingredients can trigger these responses.
*   **Reduced Absorption:** The body's ability to absorb nutrients from supplements is reduced during fasting, especially for fat-soluble vitamins which require food.
*   **Nutrient Sensitivity:** Short periods of micronutrient deficiency can actually increase the body's sensitivity to those nutrients long-term.

It is generally unnecessary and even counterproductive to take supplements while fasting for typical durations (16-20 hours or even longer fasts up to a week).

## 5. Not Fasting Long Enough

The most significant benefits of fasting, including stem cell growth and robust autophagy, typically begin after **at least 20 hours** of fasting.

*   **Fat Loss:** While caloric deficit matters most for fat loss, it doesn't yield the same health benefits as true fasting.
*   **Breaking Fast with Too Little:** Breaking a 16-hour fast with very few calories (e.g., 100 calories) can trigger a catabolic state as the body seeks nutrients. It's often better for health and performance to fast slightly longer and consume more nutrient-dense food when breaking the fast.

## 6. Fasting for Too Long Too Often

Fasting is a stressor, and overdoing it can lead to negative consequences:

*   **Metabolic Slowdown:** Constant fasting can make the body more efficient at metabolic processes, effectively slowing down metabolism.
*   **Reduced Ability to Handle Stress:** The body's stress response mechanisms can become less effective.

**Strategies to Avoid Overdoing It:**

*   **Vary Fasting Schedule:** Include periods of more frequent eating.
*   **Extend Eating Window:** On some days, increase the eating window by a few hours (e.g., from 2 to 4, 6, or 8 hours).

## 7. Combining Severe Caloric Restriction with Intermittent Fasting

This combination can significantly lower metabolism.

*   **Difficulty Consuming Enough Calories:** Eating within a shorter window makes it harder to meet daily caloric and macronutrient needs.
*   **Subconscious Undereating:** This can lead to feelings of decreased hunger.
*   **Negative Impact on Longevity:** Prolonged severe caloric restriction can have a detrimental effect on longevity.

**Solutions:**

*   **Extend Eating Window:** As mentioned above.
*   **Increase Calorie Intake:** Add an extra meal or increase portion sizes.
*   **Stimulate Anabolic Growth:** Ensure adequate intake of calories, especially protein and amino acids, to counterbalance the catabolic effects of fasting (autophagy, AMPK) with anabolic processes (mTOR). This is crucial for preventing muscle loss and frailty, and for promoting longevity.

**Key Metabolic Pathways Involved:**

*   **Catabolism:** Breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones to release energy.
    *   Cortisol -> Mobilization of fat and glycogen stores.
    *   AMPK -> Promotes cellular breakdown and energy conservation.
*   **Anabolism:** Synthesis of complex molecules from simpler ones, requiring energy.
    *   mTOR -> Promotes cellular growth, proliferation, and protein synthesis.

**Balance is Key:** Fasting promotes catabolism for longevity and cellular repair, but this must be balanced with anabolism during feeding periods to support growth, muscle maintenance, and overall vitality.
