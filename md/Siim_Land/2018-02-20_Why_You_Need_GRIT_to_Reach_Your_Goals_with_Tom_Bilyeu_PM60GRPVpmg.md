# 2018-02-20 Why You Need GRIT to Reach Your Goals with Tom Bilyeu

## Executive Summary

*   **Brain Wiring:** Whatever thoughts are articulated repeatedly in the mind will manifest as physical wiring in the brain (myelination), making those thoughts easier to access and creating default thought patterns.
*   **Grit as a Learned Skill:** Grit and perseverance are not innate but learned and developed through intentional effort, often fueled by a deep desire for change or even shame, and by surrounding oneself with inspiring examples.
*   **Balanced Mindset:** Continuous improvement requires balancing self-confidence (believing in one's current abilities) with a beginner's mind (acknowledging what one doesn't know) to avoid stagnation.
*   **Proactive Response:** Meditation expands the "empty space" between a stimulus and a response, allowing individuals to choose their reaction intentionally rather than simply reacting to emotions or habits.
*   **Goal-Oriented Action:** Sustained progress depends on relentlessly and honestly evaluating whether current actions are genuinely moving one towards their overarching goals.

## Developing Grit

Grit and perseverance are the personality traits Tom Bilyeu is most proud of, particularly because he had to actively develop them. This journey involved:

1.  **Confronting Shame:** Acknowledging a significant disconnect between aspirations, words, and actual actions, particularly in a relationship, served as a powerful motivator for change.
2.  **Cultivating a Growth Mindset:** Embracing the belief that anything can be learned and improved, akin to building physical strength in a gym, by forcing oneself to stick with difficult or boring tasks.
3.  **Inspiration and Visualization:** Surrounding oneself with stories and images of individuals demonstrating extreme grit (e.g., Michael Jordan's "flu game") and internalizing the identity of someone who embodies such resilience.
4.  **Pushing Boundaries:** Consistently seeking the edge of one's capabilities and deliberately pushing beyond them, gradually expanding comfort zones and transforming challenging tasks into habits.

## Brain Wiring and Mindset

The mind actively shapes the physical structure of the brain. This process is called myelination, where repeated thoughts strengthen neural pathways, making those thoughts more effortless to access.

*   **Negative Self-Talk Cycle:**
    *   **Internal Monologue:** Thoughts like "I'm not good enough" or "This is really hard" repeatedly articulated in the mind.
    *   **Brain Wiring:** These thoughts cause myelin to wrap around neural connections, making it easier and faster for electrical impulses to travel along these negative pathways.
    *   **Behavioral Reinforcement:** Engaging in self-deprecating humor or expressing these negative thoughts out loud further reinforces the wiring and sets external expectations, creating a "paralysis of inability."
*   **Positive Self-Talk Cycle:** By consciously choosing to articulate positive thoughts and affirmations, one can rewire their brain to make positive thinking the default, even if negative thoughts still arise, they don't become chronic loops.

## Growth Mindset vs. Beginner's Mind

Achieving success requires the ability to hold two competing ideas simultaneously:

*   **Self-Confidence:** Believing in one's extraordinary abilities and capacity to perform.
*   **Beginner's Mind:** Acknowledging that one knows nothing and being wary of the trap of thinking one already knows something. As the stoic quote suggests, "You can't learn what you think you already know." This prevents stagnation and encourages fresh thinking, as genius is often associated with the willingness to continuously explore new ideas.

## Prioritizing Goals and Overcoming Obstacles

To effectively pursue goals and overcome feeling stuck:

**1. Strategic Goal Breakdown (Lead Domino Concept - Tim Ferriss):**

*   **Define Goal:** Clearly articulate the ultimate objective.
*   **Assess Current Position:** Understand the starting point.
*   **Identify the Gap:** Recognize the space between current status and the goal.
*   **Break Down Into Chunks:** Segment the journey into manageable, step-by-step actions.
*   **Find the Lead Domino:** Ask: "What one thing could I do or learn that would knock down a bunch of other things?" Focus on actions with the greatest ripple effect.

**2. Addressing Feeling Stuck or Lost:**

When feeling stuck, drained, or unsure of the next step, seek external guidance:

*   **Identify Advisors:** Find individuals who are significantly farther ahead in their journey or possess expertise in the desired area.
*   **Ask Strategic Questions:** Engage these advisors in a "no bullshit" game by asking:
    *   "Why am I about to fail?"
    *   "What would I have to do to guarantee my success?"
*   **Uncover Critical Pieces:** Even absurd answers can reveal the true critical components for success. This clarifies the effort or resources required, even if one chooses a different path later.
    *   **Example (Quest Nutrition):** The goal was to help someone become lean and happy.
        *   *Guaranteed Success (Absurd):* Kidnap them and only feed them boiled chicken and steamed broccoli. Result: Lean but miserable.
        *   *Alternative Path (Quest Foundation):* Create delicious food that people would choose based on taste, and that also happened to be healthy.

**3. Discovering Your Path:**

If unsure about personal goals or what to pursue:

*   **Engage Curiosity:** Actively seek out and engage with a wide variety of interests.
*   **Deep Dive:** Once something piques curiosity, dive deeply into it to see if it develops into a genuine fascination.
*   **Broad Experience:** If nothing immediately comes to mind, it indicates a need to experience a broader range of activities and fields.

## Daily Habits for Improvement

Tom Bilyeu recommends several non-negotiable daily habits for personal improvement:

*   **Prioritize Sleep:**
    *   Go to bed early and on time every night (e.g., 9 PM).
    *   Aim to sleep during "magic hours" (e.g., 10 PM to 2 AM) for optimal melatonin secretion and rest.
    *   Avoid alarms and wake up naturally, adjusting bedtime to ensure sufficient sleep.
*   **Morning Workout:**
    *   Exercise first thing in the morning, even briefly.
    *   This helps align cortisol levels with the sleeping cycle and spikes cortisol early.
    *   Helps overcome aversion to exercise by getting it done early.
*   **Meditation:**
    *   Crucial for calming the mind and gaining control over the nervous system.
    *   Helps balance the sympathetic (fight or flight) and parasympathetic (rest and digest) nervous systems.
    *   **Proactivity vs. Reactivity:** Meditation expands the "empty space" between stimulus and response, allowing for conscious choice rather than automatic reaction. Viktor Frankl's quote highlights this: "Between stimulus and response is an empty space. And in that empty space, you can choose your response."
*   **"Thinkitation":**
    *   Schedule dedicated time to relax the mind, reflect, and allow creative thoughts to emerge.
    *   Connects with the subconscious for deeper insights.
*   **Eat Right:**
    *   Consciously focus on healthy eating, recognizing its direct and significant impact on brain function.
    *   **Example (Fasting Schedule):** Experimenting with eating the last meal four hours before bed, instead of prolonging morning fasting, significantly improved hunger management due to insights into microbiome health.

**4. Continuous Self-Assessment:**

*   Relentlessly and honestly ask: "Is what I'm doing actually moving me towards my goal or not?" This critical self-reflection is paramount for continuous progress.

## Business Philosophy & Quest Nutrition Story

Tom Bilyeu's business journey highlights the importance of adaptability and passion:
