# 2016-11-22 Habit 1 Be Proactive 7 Habits of Highly Effective People Summary Part Two

*   Proactivity involves taking extreme ownership and leveraging human meta-awareness to choose one's response to situations, rather than being dictated by circumstances.
*   Reactive individuals use external blame (e.g., "He makes me so bad"), while proactive people embrace 'response-ability' – the ability to choose their reaction.
*   Cultivating proactivity includes taking initiative, using proactive language (e.g., "I will" instead of "I can't"), and concentrating efforts on the 'circle of influence' (controllable factors) instead of the 'circle of concern' (uncontrollable factors).
*   Proactive individuals acknowledge mistakes, correct them, learn from failures, and use these experiences as stepping stones towards future success.

## What is Proactivity?
Being proactive means taking extreme ownership over one's life and rising above circumstance, rather than allowing a situation to dictate reality. This concept stems from meta-awareness, the uniquely human ability to think about one's own thought processes and create external models of oneself. This heightened self-consciousness allows individuals to perceive themselves as separate from their feelings, moods, or paradigms, providing the fundamental perception of effectiveness through the possibility to choose and optimize behavior.

## Reactive vs. Proactive Mindsets
A **reactive mindset** involves taking a passive stance towards life, where external forces dictate one's experience. Reactive individuals often express powerlessness with phrases like "there's nothing I can do" or "that's just who I am." Their limiting beliefs can create self-fulfilling prophecies.

A **proactive mindset**, conversely, recognizes that individuals are in control. Proactive people possess 'responsibility' – the ability to choose how to react to a given stimulus or situation, viewing challenges as opportunities to rise and achieve.

### Thought Paradigms:
*   **Reactive Thought Paradigm (Outside In):** What's out there has to change before we can.
*   **Proactive Thought Paradigm (Inside Out):** Choosing to be different -> Positive change on what's out there.

## How to Cultivate Proactivity

### 1. Initiative
The first principle of proactivity is initiative. This means actively venturing forth and making one's own terms with life, rather than waiting for things to happen. It involves taking the first step and acting, instead of waiting for a perfect moment or divine revelation. While acting, it's important to remain grounded in reality, but also recognize the power to choose one's response.

### 2. The Power of Language
Language significantly impacts perception and beliefs. Reactive language shifts responsibility away from oneself onto others or circumstances, while proactive language acknowledges personal control.

*   **Reactive Language Examples:**
    *   There's nothing I could do.
    *   That's just the way I am.
    *   He makes me so bad.
    *   They won't allow that.
    *   I have to do that.
    *   I can't.
    *   I must.
    *   I would fail.

*   **Proactive Language Examples:**
    *   Let's look at our alternatives.
    *   I can choose a different approach.
    *   I control my own feelings.
    *   I have the discipline.
    *   I will.

Careful attention to self-talk and the words used to describe oneself, circumstances, and potential behaviors is crucial, as thoughts and perceptions create reality.

### 3. Focusing Energy: Circle of Concern vs. Circle of Influence
Proactive individuals distinguish where they focus their time and energy:

*   **Circle of Concern:** Everything that concerns an individual (e.g., other people, environmental problems, circumstances beyond control).
    *   **Reactive Focus:** Concentrating efforts here, leading to blaming, reactive language, increased victimization, and negative energy that shrinks the circle of influence. It's full of "haves" (e.g., "I'll be happy when I have my house paid off," "If only I had more discipline").
*   **Circle of Influence:** The things an individual can actually do something about (e.g., perception, attitude, behavior, habits).
    *   **Proactive Focus:** Concentrating efforts here, working on controllable aspects. This energy is positive and expands the circle of influence. It's filled with "bes" (e.g., "I can be more patient," "I can become who I want to be"). This represents a character focus.

### 4. Navigating Mistakes and Failure
While individuals are free to choose their actions, they are not free to choose the consequences. A proactive approach to mistakes acknowledges that:

Mistake -> Acknowledge right away -> Correct it -> Learn from it -> Prevent future recurrence.

The past is unchangeable. Proactivity is about turning failures into successes. Great achievements rarely happen instantly or in one shot; most successful people pave their road with numerous failures. This doesn't mean aiming for failure, but rather embracing action, which exposes one to more risk but also grants the possibility of extraordinary achievement. Proactivity means moving forward through failures and stepping over past mistakes until the desired outcome is reached, driven by the will to act.

## Action Steps for Proactivity
To implement Habit 1 into one's character ethic:

1.  **Take the initiative:** Don't wait for the world to happen to you; make your own terms. Begin moving and adjust along the way.
2.  **Start using proactive language:** Be mindful of the vocabulary used to describe yourself and what you believe is possible, thus changing your paradigm.
3.  **Concentrate your efforts on your circle of influence:** Focus on what you can control.
4.  **Don't be afraid to make mistakes:** Learn from them and turn failures into future successes.
