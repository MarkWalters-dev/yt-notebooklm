# 2019-03-31 Fasting to Become the Strongest Version of Yourself with Elliott Hulse

**Executive Summary:**
*   Fasting, particularly prolonged fasts, leads to significant physical transformations including weight loss, increased energy, mental clarity, and resolution of autoimmune skin conditions and dandruff.
*   Overconsumption of food and entertainment is a primary contributor to both mental and physical diseases, making fasting a fundamental practice for regaining strength and health.
*   Fasting cultivates mental discipline, steadfastness, and detachment, creating a greater "space between stimulus and response" for improved self-control and objectivity.
*   Optimal fasting protocols often involve transitioning from a ketogenic or low-carb diet and carefully managing protein intake to modulate mTOR pathways.
*   The process of autophagy ("self-eating") triggered by fasting promotes cellular renewal, eliminating old and damaged components to facilitate a physical and psychological "rebirth" into a stronger self.

## Fasting Benefits and Personal Experience

Elliott Hulse initiated prolonged fasting in November 2018, leading to a significant physical transformation, including a loss of 40-45 pounds. He describes fasting as "simple and easy" compared to counting macros or doing cardio. His initial experience with fasting dates back to 2002 as a spiritual practice, involving a 19-day dry fast from sunup to sundown, which led to notable physical and mental changes.

Fasting promotes periods of healing and abstinence, mirroring the natural eating patterns of hunter-gatherers. In modern society, characterized by temptation and excess, voluntary abstinence through fasting helps heal both body and mind. Overconsumption is identified as a primary factor in various diseases, with fasting serving as a crucial practice for all people to regain and retain strength. Wild animals, for example, remain alert and healthy due to natural fasting, unlike domesticated animals prone to disease from constant feeding.

Hulse sought to heal himself from autoimmune conditions, specifically skin rashes on his elbows and knees, and severe dandruff that developed over the past year. He observed that these symptoms disappeared completely while fasting, suggesting a strong connection between dietary patterns, gut health, and autoimmune responses.

## Fasting Protocols and Diet

**Elliott Hulse's Fasting Progression:**
*   Began with 36-hour fasts, going to bed hungry every other day (termed "nomads" for "no meals a day").
*   Progressed to 48-hour fasts.
*   Extended to 3-day and 5-day fasts, often doing 3-day fasts weekly (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, breaking on Thursday).
*   Undertook a 10-day extended fast, initially aiming for 21 or even 40 days.

**Hydration During Fasting:**
*   Drank water, adding sea salt and potassium to maintain electrolyte balance, especially while continuing to train.

**Refeeding Strategy:**
*   Initially, after shorter fasts, he consumed large quantities of various foods, including nuts and protein shakes, leading to stomach aches and discomfort.
*   Learned to break fasts mindfully with ketogenic and nutrient-dense foods, avoiding nuts.
*   Attempted a 7-day vegan period after a 10-day fast, breaking the fast with salads, cooked carrots, beans, broccoli, chickpeas, sweet potatoes, bananas, and apples. This led to negative side effects: foggy-headedness, returning rashes, water retention, grumpiness, and feeling "chubby." This experience, coupled with a friend's similar negative experience as a vegan athlete, led him back to a high-fat, moderate-protein, low-carb diet.
*   Currently aims for 10-15% carbs (100-150g weekly carb refeed), mostly fats, and moderate protein (125-150g).

**Current Intermittent Fasting Schedule:**
*   Meals are timed around morning workouts.
*   Example: Consumes dinner, works out the next morning, eats breakfast, then fasts for approximately 36 hours until breaking fast the following evening.
*   Food is consumed "right up against" workouts to optimize recovery and muscle growth.

## The Role of Fasting in Autoimmune Conditions and Gut Health

Elliott Hulse’s experience with autoimmune skin conditions (rashes, dandruff) disappearing during fasting and returning during high-carb or vegan refeeds strongly suggests a link between diet and these conditions. He noted that these issues often "originate from the gut."

**Detoxification Practices:**
*   During his 10-day fast, Hulse incorporated enemas and salt water flushes.
*   Even after several days of enemas and 10 days of no food, significant debris was still expelled during a salt water flush on day 11. This indicates that the intestines can accumulate substantial waste over time, even with a seemingly healthy diet, and that prolonged fasting combined with cleansing practices can help eliminate this buildup.

## Mental and Spiritual Benefits of Fasting

Fasting extends beyond physical benefits, profoundly impacting mental and spiritual well-being:
*   **Steadfastness and Discipline:** Cultivates firmness, commitment, and self-discipline.
*   **Detachment and Objectivity:** Creates a wider "space between stimulus and response," leading to less reactivity and greater objectivity in observing emotions and thoughts. This detachment allows individuals to process external stimuli without immediate emotional engagement.
*   **Mindfulness:** Increases awareness of internal bodily processes and psychological states.
*   **Spiritual Practice:** Historically practiced across cultures and religions (e.g., Eastern Orthodox tradition, which fasts up to 200 days a year) to develop discipline, humility, and detachment from material temptations. It serves as a form of meditation for profound inner experience.

## Metabolic Pathways and Fasting

Fasting has a direct impact on key metabolic pathways:
*   **Ketosis:** Adopting a ketogenic or low-carb diet before a long fast makes the transition easier by quickly shifting the body into a fat-burning state, reducing the initial discomfort associated with carbohydrate withdrawal.
*   **mTOR Regulation:** Moderating protein intake (around 100-150g) is important to manage the mTOR pathway, which plays a role in cell growth and metabolism. Lower mTOR activity is associated with longevity benefits and greater autophagic activity.
*   **Autophagy:** Fasting triggers autophagy, a cellular process of "self-eating" where the body recycles old and damaged cell components. This process is seen as crucial for renewal and transformation:

    Old/Damaged Cellular Material -> **Autophagy (Self-Eating)** -> Cellular Renewal & Rebirth

    This concept is likened to the Ouroboros, the ancient symbol of a snake eating its own tail, representing continuous self-transformation and cyclical rebirth.

## Future Plans and Philosophy

Elliott Hulse views fasting as a permanent lifestyle choice, stating that "no one should ever eat more than one meal a day." He integrates fasting into his philosophy of masculine development and personal growth.

He emphasizes the concept of "rising, death, and rebirth" throughout life, aligning with the "hero's journey" where individuals confront weaknesses and undergo transformation every 12 years (e.g., 24, 36 years old). This process, which he terms "life path initiation," requires introspection, acknowledging weaknesses, confronting them, and working through them to "purge oneself of weaknesses."

Fasting is seen as an "aesthetic practice" that directly cultivates masculine virtues such as resolve, steadfastness, and detachment. It is considered the "most powerful bioenergetic practice" he has engaged in, reducing the need for other practices like extensive meditation.

**Grounding Camp Initiatives:**
Hulse is developing "Grounding Camp" as an initiation program for men, providing mentorship and a structured process for transitioning through life phases. Fasting will be a core component of these camps:
*   **June Grounding Camp (Upstate New York):** Will introduce intermittent fasting to participants.
*   **September Grounding Camp (Florida):** A 5-day immersion that will include 5 days of fasting for the entire initiation period.

He recommends reading "The Way of Ascetics" for those undertaking extended fasts, as it provides guidance on stoicism, discipline, detachment, humility, and fasting. Hulse also highlights the value of resources like "Metabolic Autophagy" and the work of Jason Fung for providing scientific backing to the experiential benefits of fasting.
