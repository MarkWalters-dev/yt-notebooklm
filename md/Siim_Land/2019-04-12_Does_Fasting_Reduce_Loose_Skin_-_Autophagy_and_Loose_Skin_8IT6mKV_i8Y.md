# 2019-04-12 Does Fasting Reduce Loose Skin - Autophagy and Loose Skin

### Executive Summary

*   Autophagy is a cellular recycling process that removes old cells and organelles, activated in response to stressors like UV radiation, pathogens, or injury to heal inflammation.
*   Defective autophagy leads to hyper-inflammation, increased reactive oxygen species, and is linked to age-related diseases and decreased longevity due to impaired clearance of damaged cellular components.
*   Autophagy plays a crucial role in maintaining skin health by keeping fibroblasts, which produce collagen and are essential for skin elasticity, healthy and functional.
*   While autophagy does not literally "eat up" loose skin, it supports the skin's ability to adapt and retract after weight loss by improving fibroblast health and, consequently, skin elasticity.
*   Strategies like extended fasting (e.g., 3-5 days) and combining intermittent fasting with resistance training are suggested to promote autophagy, preserve lean muscle, and support overall skin health during weight loss.

## The Role of Autophagy

Autophagy is a fundamental cellular process that recycles old cells and organelles into energy. It is activated in response to various stressors, including UV radiation, pathogens, injury, or chemical exposure, serving as a defense mechanism to cope with inflammation and fight off invasions.

**Consequences of Defective Autophagy:**
*   Leads to a hyper-inflammatory response.
*   Causes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
*   Increases reactive oxygen species.
*   Results from dysfunctional mitochondrial function, a poor immune system, and inadequate autophagy levels.
*   Is linked with many age-related diseases and decreased longevity.
*   Prevents the clearance of broken cells and mitochondria, which can spread inflammation and sickness.

Regular activation of autophagy is essential for optimal skin health, as it continuously removes cellular debris and maintains long-term skin vitality. Without consistent autophagy, the body's effectiveness in clearing waste diminishes.

## Autophagy, Fibroblasts, and Skin Elasticity

Research indicates a direct link between autophagy, fibroblasts, and skin aging:

*   **2014 Study (Japan):** Found that aging fibroblasts exhibit decreased autophagy. Fibroblasts are crucial for producing collagen, a key component that affects skin elasticity and contributes to wrinkles and loose skin.
*   **2018 Study (Korea):** Identified that aging fibroblasts produce waste at a higher rate, accelerating skin aging. Researchers concluded that autophagy is vital in counteracting skin aging by preserving fibroblast health.

Autophagy aids in slowing down skin aging and supports its elasticity by keeping fibroblasts healthy, allowing the skin to naturally retract and adapt more effectively. It is not a process that literally "eats up" loose skin but rather one that enhances the skin's inherent health and elasticity.

It is common to experience some loose skin after significant weight loss. However, weight loss achieved through methods that promote autophagy, such as fasting, may help the skin adapt to the new weight more quickly. Calorie restriction *without* the activation of autophagy (e.g., without fasting) is more likely to result in greater loose skin, as autophagy is central to maintaining healthy, vital fibroblasts. The lack of elasticity in skin, which contributes to loose skin, often stems from poor fibroblast functioning.

## Strategies for Skin Health and Weight Loss

Several strategies can promote autophagy and support skin health, especially during weight loss:

*   **Extended Fasting:**
    *   Fasting for 3 to 5 days may help in preventing excessive loose skin. While it cannot eliminate loose skin entirely, it can alleviate some of the side effects.
    *   *Historical Anecdote:* A recorded fast of 382 days resulted in a man losing over half his body weight with notably minimal loose skin, indicating the potential benefits of prolonged fasting in this context.

*   **Exercise:**
    *   Regular exercise promotes both autophagy and fat loss.
    *   **Cardio vs. Resistance Training:** While cardio aids in weight loss, resistance training additionally helps build lean muscle. Losing weight too quickly without preserving muscle mass (losing fat, water, and muscle) can lead to sagging, empty skin.

*   **Combined Approach:**
    *   For overall skin health and longevity, combining intermittent fasting with resistance training is recommended. This approach supports autophagy and helps maintain lean muscle mass, contributing to better skin elasticity and adaptation during weight loss.
