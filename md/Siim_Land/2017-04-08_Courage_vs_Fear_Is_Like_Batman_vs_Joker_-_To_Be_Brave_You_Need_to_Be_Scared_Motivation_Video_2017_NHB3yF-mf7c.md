## The Nature of Fear and Courage

Fear is a petrifying force that paralyzes action, creating an impeding wall of anxiety, resistance, and terror. When succumbed to, it makes accomplishing desires seemingly impossible, either by stoning one to the ground or prompting flight.

However, like most things, fear has its counterpart: courage. If fear were a villain like the Joker, courage would be Batman, the Dark Knight. Their existence is mutually dependent; one needs the other for meaning. Batman’s suit would remain in the closet without a dire need for justice, just as the Joker seeks to summon Batman by creating terror.

Fear operates as a low vibrational energy, rooted in self-preservation. It is an egoic force that grasps onto elements supporting its narrow worldview, seeking to repel anything outside its influence using fear as its mechanism.

## Courage: Action in Spite of Fear

To overcome fear, one must find bravery and summon courage. Courage is the trait of acting despite fear, piercing through its ranks by taking massive action. Courage cannot exist without fear; Batman would not emerge without a dire necessity for deliverance from the tyranny, anxiety, and turmoil fear would inflict upon a city like Gotham.

The Dark Knight rises only when fear is rampant. This is a constant cat and mouse game, where roles shift: sometimes fear paralyzes, and at other times, courage increases in power to overcome it.

## The Interdependence: Batman's Struggle

Even courage, though on a higher vibrational frequency, experiences turmoil and resistance. The Dark Knight is brave and assertive but feels scared, just like any other person. Feelings of anxiety, sorrow, and anger are what fuel him. His entire purpose is to fight fear, and for that, fear must exist and thrive.

The Dark Knight is, in a sense, a slave to fear, much like others. To be brave, one must first be scared. Men possess bravery in their hearts, taking courageous action against fear.

In fact, fear was the genesis of the Dark Knight. As a child, Bruce Wayne fell into a well, overwhelmed by bats. Later, the death of his parents traumatized, paralyzed, and overtook him with fear. Deciding to confront these fears, he merged with them, becoming the Bat.

## Confronting and Enduring Fear

This suggests a solution: to overcome resistance, one must not flee but charge directly into darkness and fight it. Every moment of this battle involves fear—fear for one's life, for others, and the fear of failure leading to fear's triumph, annihilating joy and subjecting the world to ego's tyranny.

It’s a constant war between guardians of good and righteous human values against the forces of darkness, which would swallow everything unless someone stands against it. However, this path carries the danger of falling into darkness oneself.

The existence of courage depends on the presence of fear. If the Dark Knight cannot come to terms with his own shadow, he will be perpetually followed by it. Deep down, he remains a tired, scared child, like us all, yet he chooses not to succumb to fear, rising from darkness to seek light. He is obsessed with fear but refuses to be its victim. He stands for what he believes is right, protecting his vision for the world.

Courage would not exist without fear, and fear will never be fully overcome. Fighting it creates counter-resistance, a force that feeds fear, making it stronger. Even if defeated momentarily, fear retreats into darkness to recover, regain strength, and return stronger. When it does, the Dark Knight must don his mask again and find bravery.

Fear is always alongside courage. To be brave, you need to be scared. The Dark Knight is the guardian who endures and faces fear when no one else will. When encountering fear, remember that only by picking up the cloak and facing it directly can one rise from darkness. Succumbing or fleeing only increases its power; charging into its ranks is the only path to victory. Even a fleeting moment of light and freedom makes the struggle worthwhile. Fear will never vanish; one must continually strengthen courage and choose to stand for something greater than oneself.
