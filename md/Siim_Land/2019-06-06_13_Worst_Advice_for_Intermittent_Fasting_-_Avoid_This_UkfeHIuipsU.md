# 2019-06-06 13 Worst Advice for Intermittent Fasting - Avoid This

## Executive Summary
*   Juice fasting, characterized by high carbohydrate and sugar intake, inhibits autophagy and ketosis, potentially leading to greater muscle loss compared to water fasting.
*   Fasting for excessive durations or too frequently can lead to adverse effects such as muscle loss, hormonal imbalances, metabolic slowdown, and exhaustion.
*   Exercise is a more critical determinant of health, longevity, muscle maintenance, and fat loss than intermittent fasting alone, with physical inactivity being a primary cause of modern diseases.
*   Fasted training has no significant proven benefits for fat loss or anti-aging and may accelerate muscle loss during resistance training due to increased oxidation of amino acids and glycogen.
*   Maintaining electrolyte balance is crucial during fasting; excessive water intake flushing minerals or chronic dehydration (dry fasting) can lead to health issues without proven autophagy benefits.

## 1. Avoid Juice Fasting
Consuming smoothies and juices introduces significant amounts of carbs and sugars (fructose, glucose, fiber), which stop the autophagy process and negate most fasting benefits. These raise insulin and blood sugar, kicking the body out of ketosis, inhibiting autophagy, and potentially leading to hypoglycemia and a more catabolic state. Because ketones and autophagy are muscle-sparing, losing ketosis can result in more muscle loss during a juice fast than a strict water fast. While certain polyphenols and compounds in vegetables (like broccoli, curcumin, ginger, elderberries) can stimulate autophagy, juicing large quantities to get a few cups can result in excessive calorie and carb intake, inhibiting the intended benefits. Although juice fasting might lead to short-term weight loss due to calorie restriction, it is not quality weight loss.

## 2. Don't Just Drink Water
Drinking only pure water during a fast can flush out essential electrolytes and minerals needed to sustain longer fasts. While hydration is vital, urinating too often suggests mineral loss, which can lead to mild headaches and increase the risk of refeeding syndrome.

## 3. Don't Become Dehydrated
Voluntary dehydration through dry fasting, sometimes advocated for increased autophagy, lacks scientific evidence of its effectiveness. Although mild dehydration affects autophagy-related pathways like AMPK and mTOR, there is no proof it offers superior benefits. Chronic dehydration is unhealthy, and proper hydration before and after a fast is critical if dry fasting is attempted.

## 4. Don't Drink Excessive Coffee
Consuming too much coffee too frequently can cause dehydration, gut issues, addiction, insomnia, chronic fatigue, and mood problems. While coffee does not break a fast and can even promote ketosis and autophagy, moderation is key. It is recommended to stick to one to three cups per day, ideally just a single cup.

## 5. Avoid Artificial Sweeteners
Artificial sweeteners can potentially raise insulin through the cephalic phase response, where the sight, smell, and taste of sweet things stimulate the gut to prepare for digestion. Although a small amount of diet soda or sugar-free gum might not technically break a fast or affect autophagy long-term, it often leads to increased sugar cravings, making it harder to stick to fasting goals and potentially leading to overconsumption. Avoiding them is generally easier.

## 6. Avoid Snacking During the Eating Window
While small snacks within the eating window might not significantly impact fat loss if a caloric deficit is maintained, they can hinder goals related to autophagy or stem cell activation. Snacking during a fasting period, or even within the eating window if not strategic, generally defeats the purpose of the fast, which is to abstain from eating both physiologically and psychologically.

## 7. Don't Jump Straight Into Long Fasts
Attempting a long fast without prior experience or building fat adaptation can be challenging. While the body is physiologically capable of going without food for several days, most individuals need to learn to manage hunger and emotions effectively. A sudden, intense approach to fasting may not be sustainable, increasing the likelihood of failure or binge eating.

## 8. Avoid Fasting Too Long Too Often
Fasting excessively with the aim of maximizing autophagy, stem cell activation, or longevity is not always optimal. Signs of over-fasting include:
*   Exhaustion
*   Muscle loss
*   Hormonal imbalances
*   Hair loss
*   Frailty
*   Slow metabolism
*   Low sex hormones
*   Obsession with eating

It is crucial to nourish the body properly and ensure adequate food intake.

## 9. Don't Break Your Fast with Unhealthy Foods
Breaking a fast with processed foods, excessive grains, large amounts of dairy, raw kale, or huge portions of meat can lead to digestive issues. Such habits can also foster an unhealthy obsession with food or contribute to eating disorders. To avoid problems, break a fast with easily digestible, nutrient-dense options:
*   Fermented foods
*   Apple cider vinegar
*   Bone broth
*   Fruit

## 10. Avoid Drastically Dropping Calories
While fasting itself does not slow down metabolic rate, sustaining a severe caloric deficit for prolonged periods will lead to metabolic adaptation and a slower metabolism. To prevent this:
*   Progressively reduce calorie intake.
*   Eat as much as possible while still achieving weight loss.
*   Cycle days of lower calorie intake with higher ones to maintain metabolic rate.

## 11. Avoid Eating Right Before Bed
Many intermittent fasting schedules involve skipping breakfast and lunch, with dinner as the main meal. While eating later in the day can be sustainable, eating too close to bedtime can negatively interfere with sleep quality and overall results. It is recommended to stop eating at least two to four hours before bed, with an optimal window of up to five hours.

## 12. Exercise is Essential
Regardless of your goal—anti-aging, longevity, muscle growth, or fat loss—exercise is more important than fasting. Modern diseases are largely driven by physical inactivity and excessive calorie consumption. While intermittent fasting addresses dietary intake, physical activity is indispensable. Fasting without resistance training can accelerate age-related sarcopenia (muscle loss), slow metabolism, and make fat loss more difficult.

## 13. Fasted Training is Not Necessary
There is no significant evidence that training in a fasted state offers superior benefits for fat loss or anti-aging. While it may slightly increase fat oxidation by utilizing body fat stores for fuel, increased fat oxidation during exercise does not automatically translate to overall body fat loss if a caloric deficit is not maintained. Furthermore, fasting is a catabolic stressor, and intense fasted workouts, especially resistance training, can lead to muscle loss due to increased oxidation of amino acids and glycogen. This makes fasted resistance training less ideal for both longevity and body composition goals, as muscle mass is critical for both.
