# 2019-02-13 How Long Until Autophagy Kicks In - THE TRUTH

## Executive Summary

*   Autophagy is a cellular process where the body breaks down damaged or unnecessary components to generate energy, primarily regulated by the opposing pathways of mTOR and AMPK.
*   mTOR promotes growth and inhibits autophagy, while AMPK senses low energy and activates autophagy. Nutrient availability, particularly glucose, amino acids, and insulin levels, dictates which pathway is dominant.
*   Fasting (zero calories) is the most effective way to trigger autophagy by lowering insulin, blood sugar, and mTOR, and depleting cellular nutrient stores.
*   The time required for autophagy to activate varies significantly based on diet, with standard Western diets requiring longer fasting periods (48-72 hours) compared to low-carbohydrate diets (within 24 hours).
*   Combining fasting with resistance training can optimize the benefits of both autophagy and mTOR activation in specific tissues, promoting growth where desired (muscles) and catabolism where beneficial (fat cells, tumor cells).

## Introduction to Autophagy

Autophagy is a fundamental metabolic process where cells degrade and recycle cellular debris and dysfunctional organelles to produce energy. This "self-eating" mechanism is crucial for cellular maintenance and survival.

## Key Regulatory Pathways: mTOR and AMPK

Autophagy activation is primarily governed by two key signaling pathways:

*   **mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin):**
    *   Acts as a master nutrient regulator.
    *   Promotes cellular growth, protein synthesis, and anabolism.
    *   Inhibits autophagy.
*   **AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase):**
    *   Functions as a cellular fuel sensor.
    *   Balances energy-deprived states by maintaining energy homeostasis.
    *   Mobilizes the body's backup fuel sources.
    *   Supports autophagy by indicating an energy-deprived state and the need to break down internal energy stores.

### The Interplay Between mTOR and AMPK

*   When nutrients are scarce, AMPK becomes activated.
*   AMPK inhibits cellular growth by suppressing the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway.
*   This suppression forces the body to catabolize its less essential components, initiating autophagy.
*   The greater the depletion of nutrient factors like amino acids, glucose, and calories, the stronger the signal to trigger autophagy.

The decision for cells to be anabolic (growth-oriented) or catabolic (breakdown-oriented) is determined by nutrient sensing and influenced by growth factors such as insulin, IGF-one, and mechanical stimuli.

## Factors Inhibiting Autophagy

Several factors inherently suppress autophagy:

*   **Insulin and IGF-one:** Signal the presence of anabolic nutrients, promoting storage and growth. They activate the AKT-mTORC1-p70S6K pathway, which is counter to autophagy.
*   **Carbohydrates:** Increase insulin and blood sugar, thereby stopping autophagy. While it's possible to be catabolic with inactive mTOR while consuming carbs without protein, autophagy remains inhibited due to nutrient presence.
*   **Amino Acids and Protein:** Reduce the necessity for autophagy as the body detects sufficient essential nutrients. Even with protein restriction to prevent muscle protein synthesis, some protein intake can still activate mTOR and inhibit autophagy. Therefore, protein restriction alone is not an effective autophagy-boosting strategy.
*   **Excess Calories:** From any macronutrient source (protein, carbs, exogenous ketones, fat) can raise mTOR and insulin, while suppressing AMPK. Even though fat may not spike insulin as high as carbs, it still directs energy towards storage, reducing the need for autophagy.

Autophagy is generally regulated by the nutrient status of cells, including amino acid availability, fasting duration, blood sugar, insulin levels, calorie intake, and the body's overall energy demand.

## Estimating Autophagy Activation Time

While direct measurement of autophagy in humans is not feasible, it can be estimated using markers like the glucose ketone index and the insulin to glucagon ratio.

*   **Insulin to Glucagon Ratio:**
    *   **Lower Ratio:** Suggests increased catabolism, ketogenesis, gluconeogenesis, fat oxidation, and nutrient deprivation.
    *   **Higher Ratio:** Indicates increased anabolism, higher insulin, elevated blood sugar, and nutrient storage.
*   **Glucose Ketone Index:** Lower blood glucose and higher ketones reflect an estimated lower insulin-to-glucagon ratio, indicating higher ketosis and AMPK activity.

The precise timing of autophagy activation is highly individual and depends on the body's nutrient status and the immediate presence of glucose, ketones, and amino acids in the bloodstream.

### Diet and Fasting Duration for Autophagy

The more carbohydrates and protein consumed, the longer one needs to fast to achieve autophagy as the body must first deplete glycogen stores. Excess calories create a larger "buffer zone" that must be processed before autophagy begins. Mild caloric restriction or staying around maintenance calories allows for faster entry into autophagy with shorter fasting periods.

## Factors Accelerating Autophagy

The following factors contribute to faster autophagy activation:

*   **Fasting (Zero Calories):** The most effective method. It lowers insulin, blood sugar, and mTOR, and depletes liver glucose and amino acid stores.
*   **Caloric Restriction (without complete fasting):** Can help initiate autophagy during overnight fasts.
*   **Insufficient Essential Amino Acids:** Leads to faster autophagy activation during periods of non-eating (e.g., sleep).
*   **Intermittent Fasting:** Achieves the benefits of caloric restriction more effectively than continuous restriction. Longer fasts followed by proper refeeding can lead to deeper autophagy while preserving muscle mass.
*   **Exercise and Resistance Training:**
    *   Increases AMPK and supports autophagy.
    *   Depletes glycogen and amino acids, increasing the demand for autophagy.
    *   While mechanical stimuli activate mTOR, this activation is primarily localized to muscle cells, not the liver, allowing for sustained autophagy in other crucial tissues (brain, liver, kidneys). This promotes targeted growth in muscles and nerve cells while encouraging autophagy in fat cells and tumor cells.

Combining resistance training with fasting is considered an optimal strategy for stimulating mTOR and autophagy in the desired tissues without negative side effects.

## Diet-Specific Autophagy Activation Times (Estimates)

The time required for significant autophagy activation varies by diet:

*   **Standard Western Diet (approx. 50% carbs, 15% protein, 45% fat):** At least 48-72 hours of fasting.
*   **Low Carb, Moderate Protein Diet:** Within 24 hours of fasting.
*   **Low Carb, High Protein Diet:** Likely longer than 24 hours of fasting, but potentially experiencing autophagic states between meals.
*   **Low Carb, Low Protein, Caloric Restriction Diet:** Within 24 hours of fasting and between meals, though less effective than longer fasts with adequate nutrient refeeding.
*   **High Carb, Low Protein Diet:** Within 24 hours of fasting, but with a higher predisposition to muscle catabolism.
*   **High Carb, Moderate Protein Diet:** 48-72 hours of fasting due to abundant fuel for the body to process.

Regardless of diet, intermittent fasting remains a highly effective method for activating AMPK and autophagy pathways and maintaining a lower insulin-to-glucagon ratio.
