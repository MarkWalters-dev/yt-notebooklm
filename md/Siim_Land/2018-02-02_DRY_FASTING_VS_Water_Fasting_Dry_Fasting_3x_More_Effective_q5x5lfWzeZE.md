# 2018-02-02 DRY FASTING VS Water Fasting Dry Fasting 3x More Effective

## Executive Summary
*   Dry fasting may be three times more effective than water fasting for rejuvenation (e.g., 1 day of dry fasting is equivalent to 3 days of water fasting).
*   During dry fasting, the body produces its own pure, endogenous water by metabolizing fat through ketosis.
*   Dehydration during dry fasting inhibits mTOR and promotes AMPK, pathways that stimulate cellular autophagy and promote longevity.
*   The absence of water during dry fasting can more effectively eliminate pathogens like bacteria and fungi, which require hydration to survive.
*   Short, controlled periods of dry fasting induce beneficial hormetic effects, enhancing the body's adaptive stress responses and rejuvenation processes.

## Introduction to Dry Fasting
Dry fasting, which excludes all liquids, is much rarer than regular intermittent fasting with water. While extended periods without hydration can be lethal, dry fasting for a few days may have a beneficial hormetic effect. During the initial days of dry fasting, the body can produce its own water internally, preventing immediate severe dehydration. It is thought that one day of dry fasting equals three days of water fasting in terms of effectiveness.

Regular intermittent fasting offers many health benefits, including reduced blood sugar, decreased inflammation, lower insulin, improved fat loss, mental clarity, and anti-tumor properties. Dry fasting appears to enhance these effects.

## Mechanisms of Action

### Pathogen Elimination
Dry fasting is more effective than regular fasting because bacteria and fungi require water to exist. Denying these disease-causing pathogens access to hydration can lead to their demise, allowing for faster rejuvenation of the body.

### Endogenous Water Production
While dry fasting, the body begins to obtain necessary water from its cells. Once the body switches into ketosis and starts burning body fat for fuel, hydrogen from fatty acid molecules is released into the bloodstream. This process generates internally metabolized water.

**Process of Endogenous Water Production:**
Burning body fat -> Ketosis -> Release hydrogen from fatty acid molecules -> Internally metabolized water

Russian scientist Doctor Filonov estimated that the human body can produce up to a liter of internally metabolized water every day. This endogenously created water is purer and cleaner than externally consumed water, as it is free from external toxins.

### Nutrient Storage and Utilization
The body stores a significant amount of the nutrients it needs within cells. Adipose tissue can store hundreds of thousands of calories. Glycogen stores energy for physical activity, and these stores can be replenished even without dietary carbohydrates, as triglyceride molecules can be converted into glucose through gluconeogenesis.

**Process of Glucose Production from Fat:**
Triglyceride molecules -> Gluconeogenesis -> Glucose

Micronutrients like magnesium and calcium are stored in bones and can be utilized during fasting.

### Autophagy and Longevity
Recycling old, damaged cells and waste material through autophagy creates energy and hydrogen. Dehydration also inhibits the mTOR pathway and promotes the AMPK pathway, both of which stimulate more autophagy and promote the longevity of healthy cells.

**Process of Autophagy Stimulation:**
Dehydration -> Inhibits mTOR -> Promotes AMPK -> Stimulates Autophagy & Longevity

Despite avoiding external water intake, the body continues to produce water internally, which explains continued urination during dry fasting.

## Physiological Effects
A study on five days of dry fasting observed that values for blood pressure, heart rate, hemoglobin saturation, glucose, potassium, and creatinine remained quite stable. Notably, creatine clearance increased by up to 167%, indicating improved kidney function during the fast.

## Importance of Preparation and Caution
Dry fasting is an advanced form of intermittent fasting and should not be undertaken without prior experience. It is recommended to have practiced intermittent fasting for a considerable period and to have completed water fasting for three to five days to develop mitochondrial density. Experiencing a ketogenic diet at least once is beneficial, as it allows mitochondria to adapt to burning endogenous fat for fuel.

It is crucial to recognize that pushing the body to extremes can be dangerous. Careful attention to the body's signals and adequate preparation are essential.

## Dry Fasting Protocol (Daily Example)
For those considering short-term dry fasting, the following protocol can be followed:

*   **Pre-Fasting Preparation (Day Before):** Drink adequate amounts of water, consume sodium, and eat vegetables to ensure mineral balance.
*   **Morning (Fasting Day):**
    *   Consume a small dose of water (e.g., 100 ml) with pink rock salt to balance electrolytes and help reduce cortisol.
    *   Consider adding one teaspoon of apple cider vinegar to promote ketosis and autophagy.
*   **During the Day:**
    *   Avoid consuming any liquids (water, tea, coffee, etc.).
    *   Avoid strenuous physical activities to prevent muscle cramps.
    *   Avoid exposure to excessive heat (e.g., saunas, hot baths, steam rooms).
*   **Breaking the Fast (If daily dry fasting):**
    *   In the evening, break the dehydration period with a glass of salted water.
    *   Follow with water mixed with lemon juice and apple cider vinegar.
    *   After rehydration, eat a low-glycemic meal to maintain stable blood sugar and insulin levels.
*   **Extended Dry Fasting (Beyond 24 hours):**
    *   If dry fasting for longer periods, continue into the night without eating or drinking.
    *   Extreme caution and personal responsibility are paramount for extended dry fasts.

## Hormetic Effects
The human body has developed adaptive mechanisms like hormesis and AMPK to deal with periods of deprivation and stress. When applied in appropriate amounts and coupled with adequate recovery and rejuvenation, physiological stresses can be beneficial. Even short daily periods of dehydration, such as 8 to 10 hours, can elicit positive physiological responses.
