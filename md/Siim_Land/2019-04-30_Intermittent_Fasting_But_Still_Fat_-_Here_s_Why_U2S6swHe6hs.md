# 2019-04-30 Intermittent Fasting But Still Fat - Here s Why

## Executive Summary

*   **Caloric Compensation:** Overeating after breaking a fast negates weight loss benefits; consistent weekly caloric balance is crucial. Refeeding syndrome symptoms due to electrolyte deficiencies can be prevented by consuming salted water during fasting.
*   **Leptin Resistance:** The brain's inability to respond to leptin's satiety signals leads to persistent hunger and fat retention, even with high leptin levels. Chronic stress, sleep deprivation, inflammation, and hyperinsulinemia are common causes.
*   **Chronic Stress:** Various stressors (sleep deprivation, caloric restriction, intense exercise) elevate cortisol, impair self-control, promote overeating, and can cause metabolic adaptation, slowing fat loss.
*   **Circadian Rhythm Mismatches:** Poor sleep quality and disrupted circadian rhythms lead to hormonal imbalances (increased cortisol, blood sugar, insulin) that promote fat gain and hinder fat loss.
*   **Lack of Resistance Training:** Resistance exercise during a caloric deficit signals the body to preserve muscle and burn fat. Exclusive cardio, conversely, can lead to muscle loss, reducing basal metabolic rate.

## 1. Binge and Fast Cycles

Even if fat-adapted individuals can fast for several days, overconsumption of calories after breaking a fast will compensate for any deficit achieved. It's easy to reward oneself with extra food, but these additional calories accumulate. Weight loss requires accounting for the entire weekly caloric balance, not just daily intake. Consuming two days' worth of food after one day of fasting nullifies progress. Measuring actual food and calorie intake is essential to understand why weight loss isn't occurring.

*   **Preventing Refeeding Syndrome:** Uncontrollable binge eating post-fast, known as refeeding syndrome, is often caused by electrolyte deficiencies. This can be prevented by drinking salted water during fasting.

## 2. Leptin Resistance

Leptin, the satiety hormone, regulates appetite and controls body weight by signaling energy availability to the brain.

**Normal Leptin Signaling:**
*   Enough calories & nutrients -> Leptin levels high -> Signal brain to stop eating.
*   Low energy -> Leptin levels drop -> Signal motivation system to search for food.

Leptin resistance occurs when the brain fails to respond to leptin signals, preventing the "stop eating" message. While dieting inevitably lowers leptin, increasing hunger and cravings to hold onto fat, chronically elevated leptin (hyperleptinemia) can also cause resistance.

**Factors Promoting Leptin Resistance:**
*   Chronic stress
*   Sleep deprivation
*   Inflammation
*   Simple carbohydrates
*   Hyperpalatable foods
*   Hyperinsulinemia
*   Alcohol consumption
*   Frequent snacking
*   Gut dysbiosis
*   Inadequate autophagy

## 3. Chronic Stress

Chronic stress has numerous negative effects, including suppressed digestion, impaired immune function, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and fat loss plateaus. It also diminishes self-control and promotes overeating.

**Common Stressors:**
*   Sleep deprivation
*   Relationship problems
*   Excessive work
*   Nutrient deficiencies
*   Frequent or long fasts
*   Caloric restriction
*   High-intensity exercise

These stressors accumulate and can lead to metabolic adaptation, slowing fat loss. It is crucial to cycle periods of fasting with adequate nutrient intake to manage stress.

**Adaptogenic Aids:**
Certain medicinal mushrooms and herbs can help manage stress:
*   Maca
*   Ginseng
*   Turmeric
*   Ginger
*   Chaga
*   Reishi
*   Cordyceps

## 4. High Body Fat Set Point

The body fat set point theory suggests that the body strives to maintain a specific weight range, acting like a thermostat. A high body fat set point means the body subconsciously feels more secure at a higher weight. To lower this set point, a new homeostasis must be established where the body feels comfortable at a lower weight with current energy intake and expenditure. This involves consuming fewer calories while feeling satiated. Caloric restriction supports longevity, general health, and weight loss, provided it's done without nutrient deficiencies by prioritizing nutrient-dense foods over empty-calorie options.

## 5. Self-Identity and Beliefs

Self-identity and beliefs profoundly influence behavior. If one's self-identity is based on being a "fat person" and accepted as part of oneself, subconscious behaviors may sabotage weight loss efforts to fit that identity. Changing self-identity requires:
*   **Mindset Shift:** Changing beliefs about food and choosing to embody a different person.
*   **Discipline and Self-Control:** Engraving new habit loops into the brain.
*   **Emotional Rewiring:** Consciously altering thoughts and emotions experienced most often, as the brain continuously rewires based on these.

## 6. Dopamine Addiction

Dopamine is a reward neurotransmitter that drives motivation and fulfillment. Modern society offers an abundance of dopamine-stimulating activities (junk food, video games, social media, alcohol, drugs). Fasting and abstaining from these stimuli can be beneficial for breaking addictions. Overeating is often a result of deriving too much dopamine from food, rather than from other positive sources. If satisfaction came from relationships, goals, or a greater purpose, reliance on food for dopamine would decrease.

## 7. Poor Digestion

Whole foods naturally contain digestive enzymes, prebiotics, and probiotics that aid metabolism. However, many modern foods lack these, and many individuals experience gut or digestion problems.

**Foods and Practices to Aid Digestion:**
*   Ginger
*   Apple cider vinegar
*   Lemon juice
*   Sauerkraut
*   Kimchi
*   Avocados
*   Pineapple
*   Kiwi fruit
*   Chewing food thoroughly
*   Avoiding overcooking food
*   Taking digestive enzymes (e.g., bio optimizers) can help with bloating, constipation, and inflammation.

## 8. Circadian Rhythm Mismatches

Disruptions to circadian rhythms negatively impact sleep quality, lead to insomnia, increase stress and anxiety, and are linked to obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease, and heightened cancer risk. Poor sleep creates a hormonal imbalance that promotes fat gain by elevating cortisol, blood sugar, and insulin, simultaneously increasing cravings.

**Steps to Optimize Circadian Rhythm for Fat Loss:**
*   Go to bed earlier, ideally between 9-11 PM, and wake up between 4-7 AM. These hours are more productive for sleep, as growth hormone is predominantly released between 11 PM and 3 AM, aiding muscle preservation and fat burning.
*   Wear blue-blocking glasses at night.
*   Avoid bright screens and dim lights to prevent the suppression of melatonin, the sleep hormone. Blue and green light exposure at night promote fat cell production.
*   Aim for 6-8 hours of sleep and ensure sufficient deep sleep. Sleep deprivation elevates cortisol, increasing stress and leading to cascading effects that promote fat gain and muscle loss.

## 9. Lack of Exercise

Muscle tissue acts as a significant calorie sponge, increasing basal metabolic rate and insulin sensitivity. This allows for greater food intake, particularly carbohydrates, without weight gain. During a caloric deficit and weight loss efforts, resistance training is crucial as it signals the body to preserve muscle and preferentially burn fat. Exclusive cardio, conversely, can signal the body that muscle is not needed, leading to muscle loss and fat retention.

## 10. Healthy Junk Foods

Foods high in flours, artificial sweeteners, and other hyperstimulating ingredients are easy to overconsume. While items like almond flour pancakes, keto bars, or cauliflower pizza are acceptable occasionally, they shouldn't be dietary staples due to their hyperpalatability. Generally, avoiding these hyperpalatable foods makes dieting easier to adhere to and prevents caloric overconsumption. Fasting is effective, but it cannot counteract a consistently poor diet or overeating during eating windows.
