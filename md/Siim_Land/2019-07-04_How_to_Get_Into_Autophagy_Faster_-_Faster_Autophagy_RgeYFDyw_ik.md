# 2019-07-04 How to Get Into Autophagy Faster - Faster Autophagy

While conventional wisdom suggests 3-5 days of fasting to achieve autophagy, this timeline is highly context-dependent. The following strategies can significantly accelerate the onset of autophagy, allowing for shorter, more effective fasting periods by influencing what you do before and during a fast.

## Executive Summary

*   **Fasted Exercise:** Even moderate fasted cardio (e.g., walking) significantly increases autophagic markers (LC3B), enhancing the autophagic response.
*   **Ketogenic Diet & Calorie Restriction Mimetics:** Adopting a low-carb, moderate-protein ketogenic diet or utilizing specific calorie restriction mimetics (e.g., coffee, EGCG, berberine, rapamycin) accelerates autophagy by regulating key metabolic pathways.
*   **Hormetic Stressors:** Exposure to heat and cold, as well as compounds like apple cider vinegar, stimulates autophagy through mechanisms such as increasing AMPK and promoting ketosis.
*   **High-Intensity Exercise:** High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) effectively depletes liver glycogen, leading to faster ketone production and autophagy.
*   **Muscle Mass:** Greater muscle mass enhances metabolic flexibility and insulin sensitivity, contributing to quicker autophagy activation, and chronic resistance training directly activates autophagy.

## Fasted Cardio

*   **Observation:** Exercise performed in a fasted state demonstrates a higher increase in LC3B levels compared to exercise in a fed state.
*   **Implication:** LC3B is an autophagy-related protein, suggesting that fasted exercise enhances autophagic response.
*   **Recommendation:** Moderate fasted cardio, such as walking for 60 minutes or hiking, can accelerate autophagy without requiring intense exertion.

## Ketogenic Diet

*   **Relationship:** While not mutually exclusive, ketosis and autophagy often coincide and tend to work together.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Ketosis promotes brain autophagy by activating SIRT1.
    *   Ketone bodies stimulate chaperone-mediated autophagy, which targets specific amino acids and substrates.
*   **Recommendation:** A low-carb, moderate-protein ketogenic diet can accelerate autophagy due to reduced glycogen stores and controlled protein intake. Low protein intake (even without carb restriction) or low carb intake (even with higher protein) can also contribute to faster ketosis and autophagy.
*   **Key Regulators:** Carbs and protein are critical for autophagy regulation.

## Calorie Restriction Mimetics

*   **Mechanism:** These compounds stimulate autophagy and mimic calorie restriction by activating similar metabolic pathways.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Common:** Coffee (caffeine, polyphenols), EGCG (from green tea).
    *   **Medicinal Mushrooms:** Reishi, Chaga, Lion's Mane, Cordyceps.
    *   **Polyphenols:** Resveratrol, Pterostilbene.
    *   **Potent Mimetics:** Rapamycin, Berberine, Ginger, Turmeric, Ginseng.

## Heat and Cold Stress

*   **Heat Stress:**
    *   Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are released under stress (inflammation, heat, starvation, hypoxia, water deprivation).
    *   HSPs protect against cell damage and repair damaged proteins, similar to autophagy.
    *   Hormetic heat stress and Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1) induce autophagy, improving survival and proteostasis (protein homeostasis) in *C. elegans*.
*   **Cold Exposure:**
    *   Both hot and cold exposure increase neuronal autophagy.
    *   Potential therapeutic application for neurodegenerative diseases.

## Apple Cider Vinegar

*   **Mechanism:** Acts as a calorie restriction mimetic by:
    *   Promoting ketosis.
    *   Suppressing insulin.
    *   Lowering blood sugar.
    *   Increasing AMPK (a fuel sensor that activates autophagy).
*   **Benefits (while fasting):** Improves digestion, enhances liver health, and promotes ketosis.
*   **Liver Health:** A healthy liver is crucial for efficient nutrient signaling, ketosis, and autophagy. A fatty or dysfunctional liver can delay these processes.

## High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)

*   **Mechanism:** Depleting liver glycogen through combined fasting and exercise accelerates ketone production and autophagy.
*   **Mimicry:** Exercise mimics fasting, and fasting mimics exercise, by stimulating similar metabolic pathways.
*   **Efficiency:** HIIT is likely more efficient than steady-state cardio for inducing autophagy because high-intensity exercise burns glycogen at a much faster rate, potentially reducing the time required to trigger autophagy. Even 30 minutes of cardio can induce autophagy zone formation.

## Muscle Mass and Resistance Training

*   **Misconception vs. Reality:** Contrary to the idea that autophagy causes muscle wasting, research indicates autophagy maintains muscle and protects against age-related muscle dysfunction.
*   **Benefits of More Muscle:**
    *   Increased metabolic flexibility.
    *   Faster entry into autophagy (due to higher resting calorie burn and increased insulin sensitivity).
*   **Resistance Training:** Chronic resistance training activates autophagy and reduces muscle cell apoptosis (programmed cell death).

## Conclusion on Fasting Goals

*   **Optimized Fasting:** The goal of fasting is to achieve its therapeutic and metabolic benefits efficiently, not necessarily to fast for the longest duration possible.
*   **Avoiding Pitfalls:** Prolonged fasting can lead to nutrient deficiencies and muscle loss.
*   **Strategy:** Utilizing the discussed methods can accelerate autophagy, allowing for shorter, more effective fasting periods.
