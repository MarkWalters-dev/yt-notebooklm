# 2019-03-10 Balancing Autophagy and mTOR for Longevity - Biohacker Summit Tallinn 2018

**Executive Summary:**
*   Life is a balance between anabolism (cellular growth, building tissue, driven by mTOR) and catabolism (breaking down for energy, recycling, driven by AMPK and autophagy).
*   Aging involves a decline in anabolic hormones and muscle mass (sarcopenia), increasing vulnerability. Maintaining lean muscle is crucial for longevity, insulin sensitivity, and cognitive health.
*   Autophagy, a process of cellular self-digestion and recycling of old/damaged components (including mitochondria via mitophagy), is a key catabolic pathway activated by nutrient depletion and AMPK, essential for anti-aging and disease prevention.
*   Both extreme anabolism (e.g., excessive mTOR activation) and excessive catabolism (e.g., too much autophagy leading to muscle loss) can accelerate aging and be detrimental; the goal is an optimal balance.
*   Intermittent fasting, aerobic exercise, and specific "hormetic" foods activate autophagy, while resistance training and adequate protein intake (especially leucine) activate mTOR. These strategies can be cycled to promote health and longevity.

## Anabolism and Catabolism: The Fundamental Balance of Life

Life fundamentally involves two opposing yet balanced processes:
*   **Anabolism:** The process of building and growth, including DNA replication, cellular growth, and tissue formation (muscle, bone, fat, brain cells). This is prominent during youth.
*   **Catabolism:** The process of breaking down matter for energy and recycling, representing entropy and the natural cycle of living and dying.

These processes are constantly interacting metabolically, influenced by the body's input and output. Fuel (oxygen, food, calories) enters the metabolic furnace, broken down into energy via catabolism, and then used to build tissues via anabolism.

Anabolic hormones (e.g., growth hormone, testosterone) promote growth and muscle maintenance in early life. As individuals age, typically after 20-30 years, these hormones begin to plummet, leading to a shift towards catabolic cycles and the loss of muscle mass and strength.

## Aging and Sarcopenia

A significant contributor to aging is sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass. This decline is linked to reduced growth hormone and testosterone production. Maintaining lean muscle is vital for longevity as it functions as a metabolic organ:
*   Increases insulin sensitivity, protecting against heart disease.
*   Supports cognitive performance.
*   Maintains joint integrity and physical resilience, reducing risks like falls in older age.

While anabolism (growth) is essential, extreme anabolism (e.g., excessive bodybuilding practices) and extreme catabolism (e.g., severe muscle wasting in old age) can both accelerate aging and lead to adverse outcomes. The key is to achieve an optimal balance between these cycles.

## Key Nutrient Sensing Pathways: mTOR and AMPK

The body continuously monitors its energetic and nutrient status through sophisticated signaling pathways known as protein kinase triads.

### mTOR: The Anabolic Pathway
*   **mTOR** (mammalian Target of Rapamycin) is the primary anabolic pathway.
*   It acts as a genetic fuel sensor that directs cellular growth, anabolism, muscle building, telomere lengthening, and DNA replication.
*   **Activation:** Primarily by nutrient factors and growth factors such as insulin, IGF-1, glucose, carbohydrates, and amino acids (especially leucine).
*   **Role:** Promotes growth and energy storage.

### AMPK: The Catabolic Pathway
*   **AMPK** (AMP-activated protein kinase) is a critical catabolic fuel sensor.
*   It detects a lack of nutrients and is elevated during energy starvation when the body's immediate calorie stores are depleted.
*   **Role:** Helps mobilize stored energy (from bone matrix, adipose tissue) to survive periods of energy deprivation, activating pathways for energy production (e.g., fatty acid oxidation, improved glucose transport).
*   **Activation:** Energetic stress on the body.
*   **Effects:** Triggers autophagy and blocks anabolic pathways like protein synthesis and mTOR, prioritizing recycling over growth.

**Interplay of Pathways:**
*   AMPK activation leads to the activation of ULK1 (UNC-51-like kinase 1).
*   **Energy Starvation / Nutrient Depletion -> AMPK Activation -> ULK1 Activation -> Autophagy Activation**
*   mTOR activation blocks autophagy. When there is an abundance of nutrients, the body prioritizes anabolism and storage, inhibiting the recycling process.
*   **Nutrient Excess (Insulin, IGF-1) -> mTOR Activation -> Autophagy Blocked -> Accelerated Aging / Higher Cancer Risk**

## Autophagy: Cellular Recycling for Longevity

Autophagy (from Greek, meaning "self-digestion" or "eating of self") is a fundamental biological process where healthy cells consume old, weak, or damaged cells and cellular components. These components are then recycled back into energy or new building blocks.

**Benefits of Autophagy:**
*   Reduces inflammation.
*   Strengthens the immune system against pathogens.
*   Possesses anti-aging and longevity benefits.
*   May help in disease prevention, including certain cancers.
*   Eliminates pathogens and viruses.

Autophagy is the body's innate healing mechanism, crucial for maintaining cellular health and promoting the survival of healthy cells by clearing out dysfunctional ones.

## The Mitochondrial Theory of Aging & Mitophagy

The **Mitochondrial Theory of Aging** proposes that aging results from the accumulation of damage to mitochondria, the powerhouses of cells responsible for energy production. Daily exposures (breathing, light, movement, eating, sleeping) cause oxidative stress and damage to mitochondria, leading to the creation of free radicals and reactive oxygen species. Uncontrolled, this damage can lead to apoptosis (cellular death) and mitochondrial destruction.

**Mitophagy:**
*   Mitophagy is a specialized form of autophagy focused on mitochondria.
*   It involves the selective recycling of old and weak mitochondria into healthy ones.
*   **Role:** Protects against mitochondrial dysfunction, a key aspect of longevity and maintaining cellular energy production.

## Caloric Restriction and Autophagy

Caloric restriction (CR) is one of the few interventions scientifically proven to extend lifespan across various species (yeast, bacteria, monkeys, mice).
*   **Evidence:** Studies on Rhesus monkeys show that 50% caloric restriction can significantly increase their lifespan (e.g., a 50% increase or doubling in some cases). Studies on yeast cells demonstrate that CR can double their lifespan by 100%.
*   **Mechanism:** While CR offers benefits like lower insulin, reduced obesity, and improved metabolic health, much evidence links its longevity effects directly to **autophagy activation**.
*   **Key Finding:** Studies on genetically modified mice unable to activate autophagy due to a genetic mutation showed that even when calorically restricted, they did *not* live longer. In contrast, a group of mice proficient at causing autophagy, even with CR, lived longer. This indicates that autophagy, not merely caloric restriction, is the primary mechanism by which CR promotes longevity.

Therefore, the objective is to activate autophagy, which can be achieved strategically without severe or continuous starvation.

## Strategies for Balancing Autophagy and mTOR

Optimal health and longevity require a dynamic balance between activating autophagy (catabolism/recycling) and mTOR (anabolism/growth). IGF-1, a growth factor activated by growth hormone, also plays a crucial role.
*   **Growth Hormone (from pituitary gland) -> Liver -> IGF-1 release into bloodstream**
*   **IGF-1 -> Muscle growth, bone strength, tissue repair, general anabolism**
*   Both too low and too high levels of IGF-1 are detrimental, with optimal longevity found at moderate levels.

### Activating Autophagy

*   **Intermittent Fasting (Time-Restricted Feeding):**
    *   Involves confining calorie intake to a shorter window daily (e.g., 16 hours fasting, 8 hours eating).
    *   Allows the body to enter a state of energy depletion, which activates autophagy, without necessarily restricting total calories.
    *   Example: Skipping breakfast and consuming all meals within an 8-hour window. Longer eating windows (e.g., 12 hours) may not sufficiently activate autophagy.
*   **Control Insulin and Blood Sugar:** High insulin levels drive mTOR activation, thus inhibiting autophagy.
*   **Caloric Restriction:** Beneficial to some extent, but can be managed through time-restricted feeding to avoid extreme deprivation.
*   **Exercise (Aerobic):** Cardio and other aerobic exercises are generally more pro-autophagy than resistance exercise.
*   **Hormetic Foods, Herbs, and Spices:** Certain compounds can stimulate autophagy.
    *   **Adaptogens:** Ashwagandha, ginseng, curcumin, ginger.
    *   **Medicinal Mushrooms:** Chaga, reishi, lion's mane.
    *   **Sulforaphane-rich Vegetables:** Broccoli, cauliflower.
    *   **Beverages:** Coffee, tea (to a lesser extent).
    *   **Polyphenols:** Resveratrol (found in berries).
*   **Extended Fasts:** Fasting for 3-5 days a few times a year can deeply activate the autophagy pathway, providing significant cellular clean-up and disease prevention.
*   **Pharmacological Agents:** Anti-diabetic drugs like metformin and berberine, and rapamycin, can suppress insulin/blood sugar and mTOR, thereby promoting autophagy.

### Activating mTOR

*   **Resistance Training:**
    *   The best way to activate mTOR; involves lifting weights and focusing on strength movements.
    *   Strengthens bones and drives muscle protein synthesis.
*   **Adequate Protein Intake:**
    *   Essential for preventing sarcopenia and maintaining muscle mass.
    *   **Amino Acids:** The most powerful mTOR activator is leucine.
    *   **Leucine-Rich Foods:** Eggs, dairy, poultry, meat, fish.
*   **Supplements:**
    *   **Creatine Monohydrate:** Found naturally in red meat; as a supplement, it boosts ATP and helps maintain muscle mass.
    *   **Phosphatidic Acid:** A lipid produced during exercise and found in some foods, also activates mTOR.
*   **Caloric Surplus:** Eating more food generally drives mTOR and promotes growth. Combining carbohydrates with protein can significantly increase insulin levels compared to protein alone.

## The Dynamic Balance

The notion of a perfect "balance" between anabolic and catabolic cycles is less about a static equilibrium and more about a constant, dynamic process of cycling. During a fasted state, the body is primarily catabolic, emphasizing recycling and repair through autophagy. During eating periods, it becomes more anabolic, prioritizing growth and tissue building via mTOR. Intelligent cycling of these states is key to maximizing health span and longevity.

**Example Daily Cycle for Optimization:**
1.  **First part of the day (fasted):** Consume autophagy-boosting foods (if breaking fast early, or as part of a meal within the eating window).
2.  **During the day:** Stimulate AMPK with exercise, potentially training in a low-glycogen state.
3.  **After workout/within eating window:** Consume muscle-sustaining foods (adequate protein, especially leucine) to promote mTOR activation and muscle protein synthesis.

Understanding and actively managing these fundamental biological pathways allows individuals to optimize their health, enhance longevity, and prevent disease.
