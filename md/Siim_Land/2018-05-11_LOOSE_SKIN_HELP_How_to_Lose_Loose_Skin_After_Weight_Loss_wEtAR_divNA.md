# 2018-05-11 LOOSE SKIN HELP How to Lose Loose Skin After Weight Loss

## Executive Summary
*   Collagen is crucial for skin elasticity and suppleness; its production decreases with age and poor diet.
*   Smoking significantly accelerates skin aging and reduces elasticity by decreasing collagen levels.
*   Building lean muscle mass is essential to fill the empty space left by fat loss, leading to tighter-looking skin and improved physique.
*   Red light therapy, specifically wavelengths between 600-900 nanometers, positively impacts collagen synthesis and ATP production.
*   Fasting, particularly extended periods (48-72 hours), can trigger autophagy, which may aid in skin tightening and cellular repair.

## Key Strategies for Tightening Loose Skin

### 1. Increase Collagen Intake

Collagen is a vital amino acid for skin, hair, nails, tendons, and organs, contributing to skin elasticity and suppleness. The body's natural collagen production declines with age and poor diet.

*   **Essential Nutrients:** Ensure adequate protein intake and other amino acids like elastin, glycine, and proline.
*   **Collagen-Rich Foods:**
    *   Tendon meats (beef, chicken thighs, wings, ribs)
    *   Bone broth soup
    *   Fish (salmon, sardines, especially bones)
    *   Eggs
    *   Oysters
*   **Collagen Production Support:**
    *   Plant-based foods high in sulfur (green leafy vegetables, garlic, onions)
    *   Gotu Kola (an aromatic herb)
*   **Supplementation:**
    *   Gelatin supplementation has shown to improve skin elasticity.
    *   Natural gelatin sources include oxtail, chicken feet, and ribs. Sugar-free Jell-O is also an option.
    *   Combining gelatin with borage oil can enhance skin elasticity effects.

### 2. Stop Smoking

Smoking and exposure to other carcinogens negatively impact skin elasticity and decrease collagen levels.

*   **Accelerated Aging:** One study indicated that smokers' skin aged biologically nine years older than their chronological age. After quitting for nine months, the biological skin age reduced by thirteen years.
*   **Alcohol Consumption:** Drinking alcohol is also detrimental to skin health.

### 3. Ensure Adequate Vitamin Intake

Specific vitamins play crucial roles in skin health and collagen production.

*   **Vitamin C:** Essential for building collagen and gelatin, supporting tissue growth and repair.
    *   *Sources:* Vegetables, fermented foods, fruits, berries, peppers.
*   **Vitamin E:** An antioxidant with UV protective qualities important for skin health.
    *   *Sources:* Almonds, spinach, avocados, sweet potatoes, sunflower seeds.
*   **Vitamin A:** Supports healthy skin cell production and stimulates fibroblasts, which maintain skin firmness.
    *   *Sources:* Organ meats (liver), squash, sweet potatoes, kale.
*   **Biotin (Vitamin B7):** Maintains youthful skin, hair, and nails.
    *   *Sources:* Organ meats, eggs, avocados, fish, mushrooms, cruciferous vegetables.
*   **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Beneficial for brain, heart, and skin health.
    *   *Sources:* Wild, cold, oily fish, fish oil, krill oil, algae products (chlorella, spirulina). Chlorella and spirulina also offer detoxification benefits and can boost stem cell growth and autophagy.
*   **Vitamin D:** Crucial for mood, metabolism, weight loss, cardiovascular health, and brain function.
    *   *Recommendation:* Get natural sunlight exposure, especially in the morning.
*   **Micronutrient Balance:** Avoid high doses of antioxidant supplements, as they can hinder the body's natural adaptation to oxidative stress. Focus on consuming whole foods for balanced micronutrient intake.

### 4. Build Muscle Mass

Fat tissue is stored between muscle and skin. When fat is lost, empty space can lead to a loose, flabby appearance. Building lean muscle helps fill this space, tightening the skin and improving physique.

*   **Benefits of Muscle Mass:**
    *   Fills empty space for a fuller appearance.
    *   Creates a more attractive physique.
    *   Promotes increased fat burning.
    *   Contributes to a denser appearance.
    *   Supports longevity through metabolic rate, hormone regulation, bone structure, and tendon health.
*   **Resistance Training:** Focus on heavy resistance training to stimulate muscle hypertrophy.
*   **Avoid Excessive Low-Intensity Cardio:** Too much low-intensity cardio or high repetitions can lead to muscle loss, contributing to the "skinny fat" look. When exercising at insufficient intensities, the body may convert muscle into energy.
*   **Prioritize Muscle Building:** During this phase, focus on building muscle and strength rather than excessive cardio, which can deplete muscle stores.

### 5. Red Light Therapy

Specific wavelengths of red and near-infrared light have demonstrated positive effects on the body.

*   **Wavelengths:** 600 to 900 nanometers.
*   **Mechanisms of Action:**
    *   Passes through the skin.
    *   Enhances collagen synthesis.
    *   Increases ATP production.
    *   Builds more mitochondria.
    *   Reduces oxidative stress.
    *   Promotes skin healing.
*   **Application Methods:**
    *   Infrared saunas.
    *   Functional health facilities.
    *   Home red light therapy devices.

### 6. Additional Skincare Tips

*   **Coconut Oil:** Possesses antibacterial and moisturizing properties that soften the skin. Can be applied to specific areas with loose skin.
*   **Avoid Harsh Products:** Steer clear of skincare products and soaps containing sulfates and chlorates, which can dry out the skin and reduce elasticity.
*   **Detoxification Support:** Consuming activated charcoal and algae supplements can assist the body's detoxification processes.
*   **Epsom Salt Baths:** Moisturize the skin and replenish magnesium, essential for nerve and muscle function.
*   **Sea Salt Scrubs:** May improve blood circulation, potentially aiding in skin tightening.

## Preventing Loose Skin During Weight Loss

To avoid loose skin after dieting, prioritize fat loss over muscle loss.

*   **Avoid Prolonged Caloric Restriction:** While a caloric deficit is necessary for weight loss, extended periods of crash dieting can slow metabolism, disrupt hormones, and lead to significant muscle loss.
*   **Extended Fasting:** A healthier alternative to restrictive dieting. Fasting can shift the body into ketosis, preserving muscle tissue and promoting exclusive fat burning. A five-day fast can result in more fat loss than a 2-3 week restrictive diet, while better maintaining muscle mass and hormones.
*   **Minimize Gluconeogenesis:** Avoid gluconeogenesis (the creation of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources) from muscle tissue. This can occur during fasting outside of a ketogenic state or when muscle glycogen stores are depleted during intense exercise without replenishment.
*   **Intermittent Fasting and Ketogenic Diet:** These approaches are effective for fat loss while preserving muscle. Reduced glucose demands help preserve muscle mass and prioritize body fat burning.
*   **Limit Artificial Sweeteners and BCA Drinks:** Consuming items with sweetness can signal the body to prepare for glucose, and BCA drinks with minimal calories may prompt muscle catabolism to find glucose. These are generally unnecessary during fasting or keto.
*   **Fasting and Autophagy:** Extended fasting (48-72 hours) triggers autophagy, a cellular recycling process that can have anti-inflammatory effects, increase longevity, support detoxification, and potentially aid in tightening loose skin. Autophagy breaks down cellular debris, including old cells, toxins, and damaged mitochondria.

## Holistic Health Lifestyle

The strategies mentioned should be integrated into a comprehensive health approach:

*   Regular fasting.
*   Consuming nutritious foods.
*   Engaging in exercise.
*   Building muscle.
*   Avoiding toxins.
*   Managing stress.

Before considering surgery for loose skin, it's important to determine if it's truly loose skin or residual excess fat.
