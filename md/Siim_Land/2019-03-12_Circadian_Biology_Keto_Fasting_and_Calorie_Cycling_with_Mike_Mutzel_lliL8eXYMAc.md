# 2019-03-12 Circadian Biology Keto Fasting and Calorie Cycling with Mike Mutzel

## Executive Summary

*   Oscillating calorie intake, rather than a constant daily intake, is crucial for preventing metabolic adaptation and potential slowing.
*   Out-of-season fruit consumption in animal models led to increased fat-forming enzymes and visceral fat gain compared to in-season consumption, suggesting a role for circadian biology or microbiome signaling.
*   The body's response to nutrients is not solely dependent on macronutrient composition but is significantly influenced by hormonal signals and nutrient-sensing pathways, emphasizing the importance of metabolic flexibility.
*   Fasting offers significant benefits beyond continuous calorie restriction, including improved insulin sensitivity, fat loss, muscle mass preservation, and potential neurochemical increases associated with mental clarity.
*   Epigenetic signals, such as microRNAs and other molecules absorbed from food, may play a crucial role in gene expression and overall health, underscoring the importance of food quality beyond macronutrients.

## Understanding Metabolic Adaptation and Calorie Cycling

The body adapts to consistent dietary patterns and exercise routines. To prevent the metabolism from adapting and potentially slowing down, oscillating calorie intake is beneficial. This concept is similar to the "cheat day" in bodybuilding, where a surplus of calories is consumed. While direct studies isolating this effect are limited, the principle of varying caloric volume is thought to help maintain metabolic rate.

## Circadian Biology and Seasonal Eating

*   **Animal Model Studies:** Studies on rats and monkeys showed that consuming out-of-season fruit led to increased lipogenic (fat-forming) enzymes and greater visceral fat gain compared to consuming the same fruit when in season. This suggests that circadian rhythms or microbiome signals might influence how the body processes nutrients based on the time of year.
*   **Animal Responses to Light Cues:** Animals, such as chickens, respond significantly to light and dark cues, adjusting their feeding and activity patterns accordingly.
*   **Human Circadian Disruption:** Humans often circumvent natural rhythms due to artificial light and modern lifestyles, potentially impacting metabolism and biology in ways not yet fully understood.
*   **Seasonal Eating Principle:** The speaker advocates for aligning eating patterns with natural seasonality.
    *   **Keto/Fasting:** Recommended during late fall, winter, and early spring when fruits and vegetables are less abundant and naturally out of season.
    *   **Carb Cycling:** More appropriate as seasons change and fresh produce becomes available. This allows for the inclusion of nutrient-dense seasonal foods like berries and root vegetables, which can enhance processes like autophagy.
*   **Out-of-Season Fruit Consumption:** While children might receive out-of-season fruits, making them a staple in adult diets during winter is questioned due to potential environmental and biological disconnects.

## Epigenetic Signals and Food Quality

The discussion highlights the emerging understanding of epigenetic signals and their impact on health, moving beyond simple macronutrient and calorie counting.

*   **RNA Absorption:** The body may absorb microRNA from food, which could influence the gut microbiome or directly affect gene expression.
*   **Gene Expression:** Genes function by producing proteins, and RNA acts as the intermediate message. Epigenetic signals can alter how these genes are expressed.
*   **Food Quality:** This concept emphasizes the importance of food quality, suggesting that factors beyond macronutrient composition (carbs, fats, proteins) carry significant biological information.
*   **Conventional vs. Pasture-Raised Animals:**
    *   **Conventional Animals:** Often raised in confined environments with poor diets and compromised circadian rhythms, potentially leading to unfavorable gene expression.
    *   **Pasture-Raised Animals:** Offer a higher quality of food and potentially more favorable epigenetic signals due to better living conditions and diets.
*   **Pre-Slaughter Stress:** Animal stress before slaughter can affect meat quality and acidity. This stress response involves hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which might be absorbed by humans and influence gene expression. Studies on meat science journals investigate these effects.
*   **Community Health and Food:** The correlation between communities consuming low-quality, potentially stressed animal products (e.g., fast food) and increased violence is noted. Changes in food quality have been linked to reduced violence in some populations.
*   **Mechanisms of Influence:** The impact on health could be due to macronutrients, micronutrients, or these overlooked epigenetic signals.

## Intermittent Fasting and Its Benefits

Fasting is presented as a powerful tool for health, distinct from continuous calorie restriction.

*   **Benefits:**
    *   Improved blood sugar health.
    *   Increased mental clarity (potentially due to neurotransmitter increases or ketone utilization).
    *   Autophagy stimulation.
    *   Hormonal resensitization (insulin, glucagon, leptin, ghrelin).
*   **Time-Restricted Feeding (TRF):** Compressing the feeding window, particularly aligned with circadian rhythms.
*   **Longer Fasts:** Incorporating 3-day fasts quarterly (e.g., over 50 hours).
*   **Metabolic Monday:** A personal protocol of fasting every Monday, aiming for consistency and freeing up time. The premise is that one day of fasting per week can provide approximately 14% calorie restriction annually, aligning with longevity and anti-cancer research suggesting around 20% restriction.
*   **Rules for Metabolic Monday:**
    *   Cut off eating by 6 PM.
    *   Consume water, salt, black coffee, or green tea.
    *   Avoid caloric additions like creamer, sweeteners, MCT oil, or exogenous ketones to encourage the body to tap into its own fat stores.
*   **Fasting vs. Continuous Energy Restriction (CER):** Studies suggest alternate-day fasting leads to better body composition (more lean muscle, less body fat) and less fat regain compared to CER, which can result in visceral fat gain and muscle loss.
*   **Hormonal Independence:** The argument is made that it's virtually impossible to separate hormones from energy balance. Nutrient signaling is hormone-dependent, and hormones play a key role in how the body partitions nutrients. Fasting is a method to resensitize these hormones.
*   **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Studies:** Emphasizing the importance of long-term studies (e.g., 20 weeks) over short-term metabolic ward studies (e.g., 10 days) for understanding dietary effects, especially for diets like keto that require significant metabolic adaptation.
*   **Epigenetic Changes from Fasting and Keto:** Fasting and ketogenic diets can induce epigenetic changes, potentially downregulating hunger signaling during famine and promoting adaptation to caloric restriction.

## Epigenetic Effects of Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB)

*   **Mechanism:** Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), the primary ketone produced by the liver, is structurally similar to butyric acid, a short-chain fatty acid produced by the gut microbiome from fiber.
*   **Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) Inhibition:** BHB acts as an HDAC inhibitor, influencing gene expression. This was a significant finding discussed at cancer research conferences, with potential therapeutic applications.
*   **Mimicking Cancer Therapies:** The therapeutic potential of BHB in influencing gene expression is comparable to expensive drugs being developed for cancer treatment.
*   **Ketogenic Diet and Fasting:** These practices allow the body to produce BHB, offering a natural way to leverage these epigenetic benefits.

## Practical Implementation of Metabolic Monday

*   **Goal:** Consistent, moderate energy restriction (around 15-20% annually) through one day of fasting per week.
*   **Flexibility:** Can be done on any day, though Monday is suggested for its association with "Metabolic Monday" and the potential to free up time during a busy week.
*   **Duration:** While 24 hours is a good starting point, individuals can extend to 36 hours (into Tuesday morning) if they have significant weight to lose.
*   **Benefits of Consistency:** Emphasizes that consistent, moderate fasting is more beneficial than infrequent, intense fasts. This consistency mirrors success in business, athletics, and general health.
*   **Time Savings:** Fasting frees up significant time otherwise spent on meal planning, preparation, and eating, which can be redirected to other productive activities or self-improvement.

## Exercise, Movement, and Nature

*   **Continuous Movement:** Beyond structured workouts, continuous low-level physical movement throughout the day (e.g., fidgeting, gardening) increases thermogenesis and aids in fat burning.
*   **Nature Exposure:** Engaging in activities like gardening or walking outdoors provides essential light exposure to the retina, which is crucial for entraining circadian biology.
*   **Growing Own Food:** Cultivating herbs and vegetables offers a direct connection to nature, provides nutrient-dense foods, and necessitates physical activity and outdoor exposure.
*   **Polyphenols in Herbs:** Even for zero-carb individuals, incorporating nutrient-dense herbs like rosemary, thyme, and oregano is beneficial for microbiome diversity and can potentially mitigate advanced glycation end products (AGEs) formed during cooking.

## Supplementation Strategy

The speaker's approach to supplements is science-based and personalized.

*   **Melatonin:** Used for travel across time zones to help regulate circadian rhythms. Dosage generally 1-3 mg. Potential for potentiating autophagy, but continuous high doses might affect retinal photoreceptors.
*   **Myo-Inositol:** A B vitamin beneficial for blood sugar stability, particularly for women with PCOS or androgenic phenotypes.
*   **Magnesium:** A common mineral supplement for various bodily functions.
*   **Taurine:** An amino acid that may offer various health benefits.
*   **Omega-3 Fatty Acids (Fish Oil):** Recommended based on individual Omega-3 Index testing. A low index (below 4%) is associated with increased risk of depression, aggression, and sudden cardiac death. An index of 8-10% is considered optimal.
*   **Berberine Hydrochloride:** A potent compound that can help regulate blood sugar, improve triglyceride levels, and reduce waist circumference. Clinical studies predominantly use the hydrochloride form. Dosages can start at 600mg/day, with evidence suggesting 1500mg/day for maximum effect. It can lower blood sugar rapidly, even within minutes.
*   **Mioscience:** The speaker's own brand, emphasizing trusted manufacturing and third-party testing.

## Key Takeaways and Personal Philosophy

*   **Honoring Circadian Rhythms:** The most significant piece of advice is to consistently honor the body's natural sleep-wake cycles and light exposure patterns. This impacts blood sugar, energy levels, and aging.
*   **Consistency Over Intensity:** For fasting, exercise, and other health practices, consistent application yields better results than infrequent, intense efforts.
*   **Food Quality Matters:** Beyond macros and calories, the epigenetic and biological signals within food are critical for health.
*   **Metabolic Flexibility:** Embracing variability in diet and lifestyle (calorie cycling, seasonal eating) is key to long-term health and preventing metabolic stagnation.
*   **Autophagy Stimulation:** Understanding and implementing strategies to stimulate autophagy, such as low insulin levels and specific nutrient sensing pathways, is crucial for longevity and performance.
