# 2019-06-18 How to Get Faster Results with Intermittent Fasting

## Executive Summary

*   Artificial sweeteners disrupt the microbiome, increase water retention, and promote sugar cravings, potentially undermining fasting goals.
*   Poor sleep quality inhibits the release of growth hormone and disrupts melatonin production, both critical for maximizing autophagy, especially between 11 PM and 2 AM.
*   Blocking the signal for oxidative stress with external antioxidants during a fast may interfere with the body's natural defense mechanisms, such as the activation of Autophagy and NRF2 pathways.
*   Sufficient sunlight exposure is necessary to maintain Vitamin D levels, which directly regulates and induces the manufacturing of autophagosomes for effective autophagy.
*   Combining fasting with resistance training is essential to balance the catabolic effects of fasting and prevent muscle loss (sarcopenia).

## Factors That Hinder Fasting Efficacy

### 1. Artificial Sweeteners

Small amounts of artificial sweeteners (e.g., in diet drinks or coffee) may not break a fast or inhibit autophagy, but they carry risks:
*   Disruption of the gut microbiome.
*   Increased water retention.
*   Induction of sugar cravings and addiction cycles.

**Recommendation:** Avoid all artificial sweeteners during a fasting window for maximal certainty.

### 2. Poor Sleep Quality

Autophagy and growth hormone release are significantly tied to deep sleep, primarily occurring between 11 PM and 2 AM according to circadian rhythms.
*   Poor sleep quality negates the benefits sought from fasting related to growth hormone and autophagy.
*   Melatonin, a powerful antioxidant released during sleep, promotes autophagy and clears brain toxins/plaque.
*   Blue light exposure at night inhibits melatonin release, thereby interfering with the autophagic process.

**Recommendation:** Use blue-blocking glasses and avoid smartphones at night to support melatonin production.

### 3. Binging and Fasting Cycles

Binge/fast cycles are often caused by circadian misalignment, poor sleep, sweetener addiction, stress, emotional eating, lack of specific goals, over-restriction, crash dieting, or electrolyte imbalances.

While these cycles can activate autophagy, they are psychologically unsustainable and detrimental to quality of life.

**Recommendation:** Cultivate discipline and consistency to engrave better habits and shift decision-making patterns.

### 4. Unmonitored Calorie Intake

Lack of awareness regarding total calorie consumption can stall weight loss progress despite adherence to fasting windows.

**Recommendation:**
1.  Commit to a short period of tracking all calories and macronutrients to establish awareness and achieve goals faster.
2.  Develop the ability to accurately estimate the caloric content of consumed foods.

### 5. Avoiding Stacking Hormetic Stressors

Other hormetic stressors activate the same longevity pathways as intermittent fasting (IF), aiding fat loss and autophagy. These include:
*   Exercise
*   Saunas
*   Ice baths

**Recommendation:** Incorporate small amounts of these additional stressors (hormesis) to enhance and speed up the benefits derived from fasting without requiring excessively long fasts.

### 6. Ingesting Antioxidants While Fasting

Oxidative stress is a necessary trigger for activating Autophagy and NRF2, which promote the body’s internal antioxidant defense and self-repair systems.
*   Blocking this signal with external antioxidants can interfere with the benefits of fasting and hormesis.
*   The fasted state induces a more powerful internal antioxidant system (Autophagy/NRF2).

**Recommendation:** Do not take external antioxidants during a fasted state; small amounts of controlled oxidative stress are needed to build resilience.

### 7. Juice Fasting

While weight loss may occur during juice fasting, the quality of loss is poor, potentially involving greater muscle mass loss compared to strict water or dry fasts.
*   High sugar content (glucose and fructose) in juices strongly interferes with autophagy.
*   Carbohydrates kick the body out of ketosis and promote a catabolic state.

**Recommendation:** Juices containing beneficial compounds like polyphenols, fiber, and electrolytes should be consumed during the eating window, not during the fast.

### 8. Insufficient Sunlight Exposure

Effective autophagy is hampered by low Vitamin D levels, as the Vitamin D receptor regulates and can induce autophagy by supporting autophagosome manufacturing.

**Process Flow (Circadian Rhythm & Vitamin D):**
Sunlight Exposure (Morning) -> Stimulates Master Brain Clock + Triggers Vitamin D Synthesis -> Supports Vitamin D Receptor Activation -> Induces Autophagy

**Recommendation:** Obtain morning sunlight exposure to properly initiate the circadian rhythm and optimize Vitamin D synthesis.

### 9. Neglecting Resistance Training

Fasting without resistance training leads to disproportionate muscle loss.

**Process Flow (Fasting & Anabolism):**
Fasting (Catabolic) + No Resistance Training -> Increased Muscle Loss (Sarcopenia Risk)
Fasting (Catabolic) + Resistance Training (Anabolic) -> Balanced Catabolism/Anabolism

Muscle loss is associated with various ailments in older populations (hip fractures, diabetes, obesity). Resistance training must remain a regular staple regardless of age.
