# 2016-11-26 Habit 5 Seek First to Understand Then to Be Understood 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

### Executive Summary
*   Habit 5 emphasizes seeking deep understanding of another's point of view through empathic listening before attempting to communicate advice or proposals.
*   The core paradigm shift involves moving from listening with the intent to reply (autobiographical listening) to listening with the intent to genuinely understand, both intellectually and emotionally.
*   Empathic listening develops through four stages: mimicking content, rephrasing content, reflecting feeling, and ultimately combining rephrasing content with reflecting feeling to engage both logical and emotional understanding.
*   Achieving "win-win" situations requires a balance of consideration (seeking to understand) and courage (seeking to be understood).
*   To effectively be understood, one must first empathically listen to grasp the other person's paradigm, and then present one's own ideas through that understood lens.

## The Importance of Empathic Listening
Before effectively interacting with someone, making a proposal, or giving advice, it is crucial to deeply understand their point of view and perspective through empathic listening. For another person to open up and share how they truly feel, communication skills must be based on a character that inspires openness and trust.

## The Paradigm Shift: Listening to Understand
A massive paradigm shift is required for this habit. Typically, people seek first to be understood, listening with the intent to reply, not to understand. They often filter everything through their own lens, projecting their own autobiography onto other people's behavior.

Empathic listening means listening with the intent to understand both intellectually and emotionally. Its purpose is to get you inside another person's frame of reference, allowing you to see through it and understand how they view the world. Before proposing a solution or making an offer, it is essential to first understand the other person's situation, condition, and purpose. Understanding is the key to good judgment; judging first prevents true understanding.

## Autobiographical Listening Responses
By default, individuals tend to listen autobiographically through their own paradigm and respond in one of four ways:
1.  **Evaluate:** Agreeing or disagreeing.
2.  **Probe:** Asking questions from one's own frame of reference.
3.  **Advise:** Giving counsel based on one's own experience.
4.  **Interpret:** Trying to figure people out, explaining their motives and behavior based on one's own.

## The Four Stages of Empathic Listening
The skill of empathic listening involves four developmental stages:
1.  **Mimic Content:** The least effective stage, often called active or reflective listening, where one basically repeats what the other person says.
2.  **Rephrase Content:** Putting the meaning into one's own words by incorporating reasoning, engaging the logical left side of the brain.
3.  **Reflect Feeling:** Bringing in the right brain, focusing less on what is being said and more on how the other person feels about what they are saying.
4.  **Rephrase Content and Reflect Feeling:** The fourth stage combines the second and third, using both sides of the brain to understand both the content and the emotion of the communication.

Authentically listening and seeking to understand helps the other person work through their own thoughts and feelings, developing trust and removing communication barriers, opening up a "soul to soul flow."

## Being Understood: The Second Part of Habit 5
Equally critical for reaching win-win situations is knowing how to be understood. Maturity is defined as the balance between consideration and courage. Seeking to understand requires consideration, while seeking to be understood takes courage. Both are necessary for a high degree of win-win outcomes.

The key to being understood lies in first seeking to understand: empathically listening, seeing their paradigm, and then presenting one's own idea back through the lens of their paradigm. Presenting ideas clearly, specifically, and contextually significantly increases credibility. By listening empathically, one genuinely understands, which in turn lifts one's integrity. Habit 5 lies squarely within one's circle of influence, as one can always choose to first seek to understand.

## Action Steps for Habit 5
1.  **Practice Genuine Understanding:** The next time you communicate with someone, put aside your autobiography and genuinely seek to understand. Be patient and respectful without pushing.
2.  **Dedicated Listening Time:** Spend one-on-one time with close friends and family. Listen to them and strive to understand them.
3.  **Share the Concept of Empathy:** Share the concept of empathy with someone close to you. Express your intention to work on genuinely listening to others and ask for their feedback in a week on how you did and how you made them feel.
4.  **Observe Non-Verbal Communication:** The next time you observe people communicating, cover your ears for a few minutes and just watch. Identify the emotions being communicated that might not come across in words alone.
5.  **Acknowledge and Apologize for Autobiographical Responses:** If you catch yourself inappropriately using one of the autobiographical responses (probing, evaluating, advising, or interpreting), try to turn the situation into a positive interaction by acknowledging and apologizing. For example: "I'm sorry, I just realized I'm not really trying to understand. Could we start again?"
6.  **Empathy-Based Presentation:** Base your next presentation on empathy. Describe the other point of view as well as or better than its proponents, then seek to have your point understood from their frame of reference.
