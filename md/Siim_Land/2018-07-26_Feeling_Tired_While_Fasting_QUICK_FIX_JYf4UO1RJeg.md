# 2018-07-26 Feeling Tired While Fasting QUICK FIX

## Executive Summary

*   Fasting can lead to fatigue due to mineral deficiencies and electrolyte imbalances, particularly sodium, potassium, and magnesium.
*   Increased urination during fasting, influenced by lower insulin levels, can lead to electrolyte loss.
*   Physical activity, sunlight exposure, and adherence to circadian rhythms are crucial for maintaining energy levels during fasting.
*   Incorporating electrolytes, such as sodium from sea salt or pink Himalayan salt, can mitigate fatigue and related symptoms.
*   The fear of sodium increasing blood pressure is often linked to the presence of insulin; its absence during fasting can necessitate increased sodium intake.

## Causes of Fatigue During Fasting

Fasting can sometimes lead to feelings of tiredness, weakness, shakiness, and brain fog. These symptoms are often attributed to:

*   **Mineral Deficiencies and Electrolyte Imbalances:** Common deficiencies in sodium, potassium, and magnesium are exacerbated during fasting.
*   **Increased Electrolyte Loss:** Fasting can lead to increased excretion of electrolytes through urine, particularly as the body adjusts to lower insulin levels and potentially loses more water.

## Quick Fixes for Fasting Fatigue

Several strategies can help combat tiredness experienced while fasting:

### Electrolyte Management

*   **Sodium Intake:** Adding sea salt or pink Himalayan rock salt to water can address lethargy, heart palpitations, and muscle cramps.
    *   **Mechanism:** Lower insulin levels during fasting and ketogenic diets reduce insulin's role in sodium retention, meaning more sodium may be needed. Research suggests that the fear of sodium raising blood pressure is often linked to the presence of insulin, which is absent during fasting.
    *   **Salt Substitutes:** For potassium and iodine, salt substitutes like NuSalt (US) or European alternatives can be used. These have less sodium but are richer in potassium and iodine.
*   **Hydration Balance:** While hydration is important, excessive water intake without electrolyte replenishment can lead to further electrolyte loss through urination. Balance water intake with electrolyte sources.

### Physical Activity and Environmental Exposure

*   **Movement:** Subconsciously reducing physical activity due to lower energy levels during fasting can be counterproductive. Engaging in physical activity is essential.
    *   **Brisk Walks:** A short, brisk walk (10-15 minutes) can significantly recharge the body.
    *   **Counterintuitive Approach:** When feeling tired and inclined to rest, initiating physical activity (e.g., jogging, jumping on a rebounder, breathwork) can lead to feeling much better than succumbing to inactivity.
*   **Sunlight Exposure:** Getting sunlight helps the body adjust to circadian rhythms.
*   **Fresh Air:** Spending time outdoors and getting fresh air is beneficial.

## The Role of Insulin and Electrolyte Balance

During fasting, insulin levels decrease significantly. This has a direct impact on electrolyte balance:

*   **Kidney Response:** Lower insulin levels signal the kidneys to retain less water, potentially leading to increased urination and loss of electrolytes.
*   **Sodium and Blood Pressure:** The common concern that sodium raises blood pressure is largely mitigated by the absence of insulin during fasting. In fact, with lower insulin and blood sugar, the body may require more sodium to maintain balance.

## Protocol for Electrolyte Supplementation (Implied)

When experiencing fatigue or symptoms related to electrolyte imbalance during fasting:

1.  **Add Sodium:** Dissolve a small amount of high-quality sea salt or pink Himalayan salt into drinking water.
2.  **Supplement Potassium/Iodine (if needed):** Consider using a salt substitute that provides potassium and iodine, especially if dietary intake is low or during prolonged fasting.
3.  **Engage in Physical Activity:** Incorporate short periods of moderate exercise, such as a brisk walk.
4.  **Seek Sunlight and Fresh Air:** Spend time outdoors to regulate circadian rhythms and improve well-being.
5.  **Monitor Hydration:** Ensure adequate fluid intake but avoid overconsumption without electrolyte replacement.
