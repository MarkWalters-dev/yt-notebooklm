# 2019-04-15 When Autophagy Is Not Good - Dark Side of Autophagy Vol 2

## Executive Summary

*   Autophagy can enhance tumor cell fitness by strengthening malignant cells against environmental stressors like starvation and chemotherapy, acting as a survival mechanism.
*   Hypoxia (low oxygen) induces autophagy via HIF activation, which, while promoting blood vessel growth (angiogenesis) for cell survival, can also support tumor expansion and metastasis.
*   In advanced cancers, autophagy switches roles: it suppresses tumors in early stages but can promote tumorigenesis and maintain cell function in later, stronger stages.
*   Excessive exercise, like excessive fasting, is a catabolic stressor that can lead to excessive autophagy, resulting in muscle atrophy and catabolism.
*   The determination of beneficial versus detrimental autophagy levels depends on numerous factors, including muscle mass, exercise intensity, diet composition, and medical condition.

## The Dual Nature of Autophagy

Autophagy, while central to life extension and caloric restriction by recycling old components, possesses negative and potentially harmful side effects.

## Autophagy and Cancer

While key autophagy genes suppress cancerous growth, the self-eating process can sometimes promote cancer by enhancing tumor cell resilience.

1.  **Stress Strengthening:** The autophagic survival response strengthens both healthy and malignant cells against environmental stressors.
2.  **Nutrient Acquisition:** Autophagy degradation creates energy and nutrients that cancer cells can steal to feed themselves, making them stronger against nutrient deprivation induced by fasting.
3.  **Chemotherapy Resistance:** Fasting and subsequent autophagy can strengthen cancer cells, making them more difficult to eradicate with chemotherapy.

## Autophagy and Hypoxia

Hypoxia (oxygen deficiency) is a stressor that activates autophagy through the Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF).

1.  **HIF Activation:** Decreased oxygen tension activates HIF.
2.  **Autophagy Induction:** Activated HIF increases autophagy.
3.  **Angiogenesis Risk:** Hypoxia-induced autophagy promotes blood vessel growth (angiogenesis), which helps oxygenate tissues but can concurrently supply tumors with necessary oxygen, promoting expansion, metastasis, and drug resistance.

## Autophagy and Tumorigenesis Stages

The role of autophagy shifts significantly depending on the stage of tumor development.

*   **Early Stages of Tumorigenesis:** Autophagy generally exhibits a protective, tumor-suppressive role, inhibiting growth and proliferation.
*   **Advanced Stages of Cancer:** Autophagy can promote tumorigenesis or maintain the functionality of already strong cancer cells by aiding survival under energy stress.
*   **Detrimental Loss:** Conversely, the loss of essential autophagy genes (e.g., Beclin 1, ATG5) can promote the onset of tumors (insufficient autophagy is detrimental).

### Strategies for Cancer Management

Intermittent fasting is suggested for disease prevention and maintaining *adequate* autophagy, rather than as a primary cancer treatment once the disease is established.

Potential effective cancer treatments may require specific targeting:

*   **Chaperone Mediated Autophagy (CMA):** CMA specifically targets HIF for lysosomal degradation.
*   **Ketogenic Diet:** Ketone bodies stimulate CMA, offering a potential alternative to broad macroautophagy treatments.
*   **Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy:** Suggested as a potential addition to circumvent the effects of hypoxia.

## Fasting and Bacterial Infections

Xenophagy, the removal of pathogens via autophagy, offers immune-strengthening benefits.

*   **Pathogen Survival:** Certain bacteria (e.g., *Bacillus* species) utilize the autophagic process to replicate, demonstrating that autophagy is not unilaterally beneficial against all pathogens.

## Autophagy and Muscle Loss

Exercise and fasting are catabolic stressors, and their effects are determined by moderation.

*   **Benefits:** Autophagy is required to support skeletal muscle plasticity in response to endurance exercise and to preserve muscle mass and myofiber integrity. Deleting ATG7 leads to muscle atrophy and accelerated aging due to abnormal mitochondrial function.
*   **Detriment:** Excessive exercise induces excessive autophagy, leading to muscle atrophy and catabolism.

### Factors Influencing Optimal Autophagy Level

The determination of appropriate autophagy levels is highly individualized and depends on:

*   Amount of lean muscle mass.
*   Intensity of exercise.
*   Diet composition (protein, carbohydrate, fat intake).
*   Current medical condition.
*   Overall fasting schedule.

In most contexts, fasting and autophagy are highly beneficial for anti-aging and disease prevention, but they should not be viewed as a universal cure-all.
