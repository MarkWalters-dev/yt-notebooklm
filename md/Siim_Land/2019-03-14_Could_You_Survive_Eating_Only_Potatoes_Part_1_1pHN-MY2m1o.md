# 2019-03-14 Could You Survive Eating Only Potatoes Part 1

**Executive Summary:**
*   Potatoes provide essential amino acids and are a good source of potassium, vitamin C, manganese, and B6.
*   A diet consisting solely of potatoes is severely deficient in essential nutrients such as vitamin A, vitamin E, B12, selenium, calcium, sodium, and sufficient dietary fat.
*   Meeting daily fat intake recommendations (approx. 15% of calories) would require an impractical number of potatoes (nearly 200 per day).
*   Long-term reliance on potatoes alone leads to critical micronutrient deficiencies, potentially causing anemia, fatigue, nerve damage, and other health problems.
*   Monotonous diets can induce "sensory specific satiety," which may lead to a natural reduction in overall calorie consumption due to boredom.

## Essential Nutrients & Potato Composition

*   Humans require nine essential amino acids, two fatty acids, 13 vitamins, and 15 minerals.
*   A single 5-ounce potato contains approximately:
    *   110-120 calories
    *   1 gram of fat (including ALA)
    *   35-40 grams of carbohydrates
    *   4-5 grams of protein (including all essential amino acids)
*   Potatoes are an excellent source of potassium, vitamin C, manganese, and B6.
*   However, a potato-only diet would be deficient in vitamin A, vitamin E, B12, selenium, calcium, and sodium.

## Meeting Daily Nutritional Requirements

*   **Protein:**
    *   Minimum daily protein requirement: 0.8 grams per kilogram or 0.36 grams per pound.
    *   For an average adult (100-200 lbs), this is roughly 40-80 grams of protein.
    *   To meet this, one would need to consume about 15-20 potatoes daily.
*   **Carbohydrates:**
    *   Potatoes provide glucose, which would be utilized for energy.
*   **Fat:**
    *   Suggested daily dietary fat intake: ~15% of total caloric intake.
    *   For 1,800-2,000 daily calories, 22-30 grams of fat are needed.
    *   Given potatoes contain 1.0 gram of fat per potato, meeting this requirement would necessitate nearly 200 potatoes daily, which is not practically sustainable.
    *   While some adaptation to lower fat intake might occur, it is not considered optimal for long-term health.
*   **Micronutrients:**
    *   Adding sweet potatoes could provide enough vitamin A and E. However, preventing calcium deficiency would require consuming over 30 sweet potatoes and 80 white potatoes daily.
    *   Many essential vitamins are fat-soluble, and insufficient dietary fat from potatoes would impair their absorption.
    *   Potatoes do not provide enough B12, an essential nutrient for energy production and nerve functioning. B12 stores would deplete within a few months, potentially leading to anemia, fatigue, and nerve damage.

## Long-Term Viability & Human Case Study

*   **Theoretical Survival:** In theory, survival on potatoes alone might be possible for a considerable time.
*   **Micronutrient Deficiencies:** However, significant deficiencies in essential micronutrients would inevitably develop in the long term, leading to various health problems.
*   **Andrew Taylor's Potato Diet Experiment (2016):**
    *   **Goal:** Andrew Taylor from Australia vowed to eat nothing but potatoes for an entire year.
    *   **Daily Intake:** He consumed 3-4 kilograms of potatoes per day.
    *   **Outcome:** He lost a significant amount of weight.
    *   **Mechanism of Weight Loss:** Part of the weight loss was attributed to "sensory specific satiety"—getting bored of eating the same food (potatoes) and naturally consuming fewer calories.
    *   **Supplements/Additions:** To obtain additional B12 and iodine, Andrew used some seasonings, added iodized salt to his food, and consumed some sweet potatoes on the side.
    *   **Post-Experiment:** After his year-long experiment, Andrew transitioned to a whole foods-based plant-based diet, while still incorporating a lot of potatoes.
    *   **Conclusion:** While he survived the year, he eventually returned to a more diverse way of eating, highlighting that a variety of different nutrients is important to cover all nutritional bases.
*   **Overall Health Implications:** Eating nothing but potatoes for a few years might be survivable, but severe micronutrient deficiencies would likely lead to health problems in the long run.
