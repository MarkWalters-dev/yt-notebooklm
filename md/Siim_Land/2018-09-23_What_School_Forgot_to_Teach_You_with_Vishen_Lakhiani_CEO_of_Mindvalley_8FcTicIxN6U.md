# 2018-09-23 What School Forgot to Teach You with Vishen Lakhiani CEO of Mindvalley

## Executive Summary

*   **Transformation vs. Learning:** True growth comes from transformation, a shift in worldview, rather than just learning, which can be forgotten.
*   **Culture as a "Cultursphere":** Individuals are deeply programmed by societal rules and beliefs (the "cultursphere"), often without realizing it, leading to adherence to discredited ideas.
*   **Challenging "Bullshit Rules":** Many widely accepted societal norms, especially in health and diet, are outdated and disproven by modern science.
*   **Mindvalley Quest for Transformation:** A gamified learning platform achieves high completion rates by breaking down transformation into daily, actionable steps, fostering new habits and rituals.
*   **Data-Driven Biohacking:** Mindvalley utilizes a platform to split-test biohacking interventions on large populations, generating data to identify effective strategies and make scientific discoveries.

## Key Concepts

### Transformation vs. Learning

*   **Learning:** Acquiring information that can be forgotten. Studies show an 80% loss of information within 24 hours of reading.
*   **Transformation:** A fundamental change in perspective that expands the mind permanently.

### The "Cultursphere" and Bullshit Rules (BRULES)

*   **Culture:** The passing down of societal rules and beliefs, often accepted without critical evaluation.
*   **Cultursphere:** The mental world of human rituals, beliefs, and thoughts, where individuals live by what they are told is true rather than what is actually true.
*   **Bullshit Rules (BRULES):** Discredited or outdated societal norms that individuals blindly follow.

### Examples of Bullshit Rules (BRULES) in Health

*   **Calorie Counting:** A simplified view of nutrition that overlooks broader metabolic complexities.
*   **Milk Consumption:** The belief that milk is essential for bone health is challenged; strength training and vegetables are more effective.
*   **High Salt Diet:** Previous assumptions about the negative health impacts of salt have been largely debunked.
*   **"Fats are Evil" Scam (1950s):** A historical misconception that has been reversed, with fats now recognized as healthy.
*   **Diets:** Often rely on willpower (an expendable resource) and fail to create lasting change, with the average American trying multiple diets over their lifetime.

### What School Forgot to Teach You

1.  **Meta-Learning (How to Learn):**
    *   Teach efficient learning strategies like speed reading, memory optimization, and cognition enhancement.
    *   Example: Programs developed with Jim Kwik (brain coach for Elon Musk) have shown significant improvements for individuals with dyslexia, including doubled reading speeds and memorization of 100-item lists.
2.  **Mindfulness and Meditation:**
    *   Practices to understand and utilize the mind and soul.
    *   Benefits include increased lifespan, improved telomere length, better heart health, and enhanced brain function.
3.  **Better Relationships (Social Engineering):**
    *   Skills in communication and connection to combat rising loneliness (which has health impacts comparable to smoking 15 cigarettes a day).
4.  **Impact (Leadership and Productivity):**
    *   Strategies for making a greater impact at work, including leadership and entrepreneurship skills.
5.  **Biohacking:**
    *   Optimizing the body for peak performance, recognizing that biological age can differ significantly from chronological age.
    *   Focus on slowing down aging through methods like strength training and mindfulness.

### The "Unfuckwithable" Mindset

*   **Definition:** A mindset characterized by sufficient self-faith to act on one's convictions without being swayed by external judgment or the need for praise.
*   **Immunity to Judgment:** Acting on what you know is right, even if it goes against societal norms or expectations.
*   **Immunity to Praise:** Not relying on external validation for self-worth; possessing self-assurance.
*   **Feedback Loop:** The ability to consider constructive criticism for improvement without letting it dictate life decisions.
*   **Living on Your Own Terms:** Embracing personal truth and autonomy.

### Personal Biohacks and Practices

*   **Intermittent Fasting:** Practiced for 16 hours, consuming only water or coffee during the fasting period.
*   **Sunlight Exposure:** Gaining sunlight during walks.
*   **Hemo-Therapy (Hot/Cold Showers):** Optimizing metabolism through temperature fluctuations.
*   **Vision Hacking:** Improving eyesight through specific eye exercises (e.g., from 20/40 to 20/25).
*   **WildFit Program:** A 90-day behavioral change program that rewires food choices, leading to improved health markers (e.g., stopping gray hair, weight loss, clearer skin, increased energy).
*   **10X Program (Super Slow Strength Training):**
    *   Inspired by Doug McGuff's work.
    *   Involves 20-minute, 30-minute weekly workouts with 5 core exercises (the "big five").
    *   Focuses on 90 seconds per exercise for significant muscle growth acceleration.

### Wish to Have Adopted Sooner

*   **10X Super Slow Strength Training:** Identified as a game-changer for body composition and physical results.
