# 2017-04-23 The 25 Cognitive Biases Explained

## Executive Summary
*   Cognitive biases are fundamental psychological shortcuts that profoundly influence human behavior, decision-making, and perception.
*   Motivations like seeking reward, avoiding punishment, and the desire for certainty are core drivers behind many biases.
*   Social dynamics, including liking/disliking, mere association, and authority, significantly shape individual choices and beliefs.
*   Self-perception biases often lead to an overestimation of personal abilities and an optimistic outlook on situations.
*   When multiple cognitive biases interact, their combined "Lollapalooza" effect can lead to more extreme and predictable behavioral outcomes.

## The 25 Cognitive Biases

1.  **Reward and punishment tendency:** Everyone is motivated to act if they can gain from it (e.g., money, recognition) and to avoid acting if there are punishments (e.g., cancer, humiliation).
2.  **Liking and loving tendency:** We tend to ignore the flaws of people or products we like or love, even accepting significant mistakes from favored brands or attractive individuals.
3.  **Disliking and hating tendency:** We ignore the virtues and positive aspects of people we dislike, often becoming blind to their facts and opinions.
4.  **Doubt and avoidance tendency:** Humans dislike uncertainty. To remove doubt quickly, we often make hasty decisions to achieve certainty again.
5.  **Inconsistency and avoidance tendency:** Our brain conserves energy by being reluctant to change habits or behaviors, thus avoiding inconsistencies.
6.  **Curiosity tendency:** A continuous drive to learn and know outcomes (e.g., how a story ends).
7.  **Kantian fairness tendency:** The "golden rule"—treating others as one wishes to be treated, often with an expectation of future reciprocation.
8.  **Envy and jealousy tendency:** Arises from the desire for scarce resources possessed by others.
9.  **Reciprocation tendency:** A desire to return favors to those who have helped us.
10. **Influence from mere association tendency:** We can be manipulated by associating products with famous people (e.g., associating Nikes with athletic prowess due to celebrity endorsement).
11. **Simple pain avoiding psychological denial:** A habit of distorting facts to fit personal views, preferring self-deception over facing uncertainty or change. Bad habits are often only addressed in emergencies or illness.
12. **Excessive self regard tendency:** We tend to believe we are above average in various attributes (e.g., smarter, more attractive, more persuasive) than we actually are.
13. **Over optimism tendency:** A tendency to be more optimistic about situations than objective reasons warrant.
14. **Deprival super reaction tendency (Loss Aversion):** A stronger preference for avoiding a loss than for gaining an equivalent item.
15. **Social proof tendency:** The inclination to think and act as others do, especially those with status or within a group.
16. **Contrast misreaction tendency:** Misunderstanding comparisons, leading to poor decisions (e.g., perceiving a sale item as a bargain irrespective of its actual value).
17. **Stress influence tendency:** Elevated stress levels (adrenaline) can lead to faster and more extreme reactions, with too much stress being detrimental.
18. **Availability misweighing tendency:** Overweighting the importance of information or options that are easily accessible (e.g., choosing fast food over healthy food due to immediate availability).
19. **Use it or lose it tendency:** Skills and abilities degrade if not regularly practiced or used.
20. **Drug misinfluence tendency:** Susceptibility to drug use and addiction (alcohol, cigarettes, caffeine, cocaine, or any other mind-altering substances).
21. **Senescence misinfluence tendency:** The natural decline of skills and abilities with aging; continuous learning and thinking can promote neuroplasticity and mitigate this.
22. **Authority misinfluence tendency:** The tendency to follow orders from perceived higher authority figures, even against one's own judgment (e.g., the Milgram experiment where subjects continued electric shocks because an authority figure instructed them to).
23. **Twaddle tendency:** Wasting excessive time on trivial matters (e.g., social media feeds, procrastination).
24. **Reason respecting tendency:** Some individuals prioritize getting an answer rather than understanding the underlying reasons, often accepting a request more readily if a "because" is used, regardless of the quality of the reason (e.g., "Can I cut in front of you because my bus leaves in five minutes?").
25. **Lollapalooza tendency:** The phenomenon where multiple cognitive biases combine and interact, leading to a much more extreme and powerful effect than any single bias alone (e.g., the Milgram experiment demonstrates subjects' brains kicking into overdrive when under pressure from multiple biases).
