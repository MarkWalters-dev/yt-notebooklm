# 2019-03-24 Optimal Protein Intake for Longevity and The Longevity Solution with Dr James DiNicolantonio

## Executive Summary
* **Protein Cycling is Key:** Optimal health and longevity likely require cycling protein intake (phases of high intake post-exercise and lower intake during fasting) rather than chronically maintaining a high level.
* **Salt Depletion Mimics Sugar Effects:** Low sodium diets significantly increase fasting insulin levels and elevate the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for glucose and insulin during oral glucose tolerance tests, behaving similarly to a high-sugar diet.
* **Hormesis over Antioxidants:** Longevity is promoted by strengthening cells via hormesis (exercise, heat shock proteins from sauna/hot baths, eating slightly pro-inflammatory plant foods) rather than solely consuming high levels of external antioxidants.
* **Plant Fiber Binds Toxins:** Plant fiber is essential, particularly to bind persistent organic pollutants (POPs) absorbed in animal fats, which are released into the bloodstream during fasting.
* **Blue Zone Characteristics:** Longevity populations emphasize natural foods, use salt appropriately, engage in prolonged, light-to-moderate activity, and exhibit high social bonding.

## Reframing Salt and Blood Pressure
Dr. DiNicolantonio’s involvement in cardiovascular research began as a community pharmacist observing patients who felt unwell or dizzy on low-salt diets, often only feeling better when salt was reintroduced or blood pressure medication was lowered.

### Flaws in Low-Salt Recommendations
* **Lack of Clinical Evidence:** Studies concluding low salt is beneficial often change the entire diet (e.g., increasing fruits and vegetables), confounding the results. There is no single clinical trial isolating salt as the sole variable benefit.
* **Population Data Contradiction:** Long-lived populations (e.g., in Japan and South Korea) consume high amounts of salt, often 5–6 grams of sodium daily, frequently through salty seaweed like kombu.
* **Hormonal Response to Restriction:** Restricting salt elevates hormones that stiffen arteries and raise blood pressure: aldosterone, renin, and angiotensin II—the same pathways blocked by blood pressure medications.
* **Salt Restriction Increases Insulin Resistance:** Restricting salt elevates insulin levels because the body attempts to retain sodium. Clinical meta-analyses show that low-sodium diets significantly increase fasting insulin and worsen glucose/insulin AUC during tolerance tests, mirroring the effects of a high-sugar diet.

### Sodium Requirements and Nuance
Salt intake is highly dependent on individual loss rates:
1.  **Caffeine Intake:** Coffee acts as a sodium/chloride depleter. Consuming about four cups of coffee can cause the loss of half a teaspoon of salt through urine.
2.  **Exercise:** The average person loses about half a teaspoon of salt per hour of exercise, depending on ambient temperature.
3.  **Keto Diets:** Individuals on ketogenic diets typically require an additional 1,000–2,000 mg of sodium (about half a teaspoon of salt) above the baseline 1.5 teaspoons already recommended.

## Magnesium, Potassium, and Insulin Sensitivity
Salt facilitates the consumption of bitter foods high in magnesium and potassium. However, the primary barrier to adequate mineral status is often insulin resistance.

**Insulin's Role in Mineral Uptake:**
*   Insulin is required to drive both potassium and magnesium into cells.
*   Hyperinsulinemia leads to increased magnesium wasting in the urine, as insulin acts as a magnesium diuretic.
*   Fixing hyperinsulinemia is often a bigger factor than simply increasing mineral intake.

**Strategies to Fix Hyperinsulinemia:**
*   Fasting (minimum 18 hours for deeper autophagy).
*   Exercise, particularly high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and weightlifting, which increase muscle insulin sensitivity for up to 48 hours.
*   Dietary swaps: Cutting refined sugars/carbs and reducing intake of refined vegetable oils high in Omega-6 fats.

## Protein Intake and Longevity
The key concern regarding protein is not just quantity but quality and cycling.

### Protein Cycling Rationale
*   Genes are adapted to cyclical protein intake: phases of breaking down protein (working out) followed by phases of non-consumption (intermittent fasting).
*   Chronically high animal protein intake is discouraged; cycling is necessary.

### Protein Consumption Guidelines
*   **Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS):** For a full-body workout, up to 40 grams of protein may benefit a larger individual for MPS. For a limited workout (e.g., arms only), 30 grams might suffice.
*   **Elderly Populations:** Older individuals experience anabolic resistance and benefit from slightly higher intake, around 1.2 g/kg of body weight, often benefiting specifically from whey protein due to its high cysteine content (a precursor to glutathione).

### Red Meat Quality and Combination
While red meat has been consumed for 2.6 million years, modern processing alters its effect:
*   **Oxidation:** Meat hung for weeks develops more oxidized fats and proteins due to iron molecule breakdown, releasing free iron.
*   **Counteraction:** Red meat contains carnosine (a potent antioxidant that binds free iron/copper), but this may not be fully protective.
*   **Binding POPs:** Animal fats today are contaminated with Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). Plant fiber is the only known way to bind these POPs during hepatobiliary recycling, which is released during fasting.

## Cellular Aging and Senolytics
Aging is defined as the accumulation of DNA damage in cells, leading to cell death or the formation of senescent cells.

**Senescent Cells:** These cells secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, driving the aging process.

**Strategies for Longevity:**

1.  **Preventing DNA Damage (Hormesis):**
    *   Exercise.
    *   Inducing heat shock proteins (sauna/hot baths).
    *   Consuming slightly pro-inflammatory plant foods to upregulate endogenous antioxidant systems.
    *   Protecting cell membranes by saturating them with **Astaxanthin** (found in krill oil/seafood) to prevent fatty acid oxidation.

2.  **Removing Senescent Cells (Senolytics):**
    *   **Fisetin:** Found in strawberries (therapeutic dose requires ~14 ounces daily or a supplement dose of about 65 mg).
    *   **EGCG:** Found in green tea (requires 10–12 cups daily or an 800 mg extract supplement).
    *   **Polyphenols:** Red wine provides bioavailable resveratrol, quercetin, and other compounds.

## The Crucial Role of Plant Foods
While hormetic stressors like exercise and fasting are vital, plants offer benefits that cannot be replicated by those alone.

### Unique Benefits of Plant Consumption
1.  **Binding POPs:** Plant fiber binds POPs present in modern animal fats.
2.  **Resistant Starch (RS) and Gut Health:** RS fermentation produces Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) like butyric acid, which activates GLP-1 (beneficial for the brain, heart, and insulin sensitivity).
    *   Longevity populations consume high RS diets (40–150g daily).
    *   **RS Maximization:** Cooking potatoes and then cooling them for 8 hours can quadruple the RS content before reheating (losing about 25% upon reheating).
3.  **Vitamin B6 Availability:** Cooking meat/plants creates B6 antagonists; B6 is most bioavailable from raw sources like green bananas.
4.  **Alkalinity:** Plant consumption (or bicarbonate supplementation) improves kidney function and bone health by counteracting the net acid load from high-sulfur animal proteins, preventing the leaching of alkaline minerals from bones.

### Resistant Starch Sources
*   Undercooked potatoes (preferred texture is slightly hard, like a soft apple).
*   Beans and traditional whole grains.

**Note on Whole Grains:** Modern "whole grains" often use steel roller mills, which strip the bran and expose fats to rancidity. True whole grains must be intact and often require refrigeration (like Ezekiel bread).

## Fasting and Acid Load
Fasting beyond two to four days can induce **metabolic acidosis**, causing continued mineral spilling in the urine. Bicarbonate supplementation (e.g., mineral water) can reverse this.

*   **Ketones and Salt Loss:** Ketone bodies (negatively charged) pull positively charged sodium ions out of the urine until the body adapts (about one week). Twenty-five percent of fasters experience massive salt loss (up to a full teaspoon daily) even without sodium intake.

## Personal Supplementation and Intake Strategy
Dr. DiNicolantonio practices a **half-plant, half-animal food** approach.

### Daily Supplement Protocol (Partial List)
*   **L-Histidine:** 2g twice daily (shown to cause 6 lb fat loss in 12 weeks by improving leptin sensitivity).
*   **Taurine:** 1.5g twice daily.
*   **Spirulina:** 6g twice daily (believed to be the most nutritious substance per gram).
*   **Chlorella:** 3g twice daily (effective binder for heavy metals, pesticides).
*   **Krill Oil:** 4g daily (providing astaxanthin).
*   **Fish Oil:** 3g daily (high quality).
*   **Collagen Support:** Glycine (4g twice daily), Maca, Camu Camu (for Vitamin C).
*   **Antioxidants/Vascular Support:** Pycnogenol (100mg), Grape Seed Extract (300mg).
*   **Vitamins/Other:** Vitamin K complex (K1, MK-4, MK-7), Vitamin D3, N-Acetylcysteine (600–1800mg/day for glutathione).
*   **Post-Workout:** Pastured whey protein.

### Longevity Supplements
*   **Berberine:** Recommended 500mg three times daily as a natural alternative to metformin for those experiencing insulin resistance.

### Exercise and Cycling Summary
*   Cycle food intake, cycling protein intake based on activity level.
*   Use beverages like red wine or green tea with red meat to help bind free iron.
*   Cook food properly to avoid excessive Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs).
