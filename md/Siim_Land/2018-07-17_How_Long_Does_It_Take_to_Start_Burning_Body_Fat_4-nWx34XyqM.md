# 2018-07-17 How Long Does It Take to Start Burning Body Fat

### Executive Summary
*   Before the body can burn stored body fat, it must first deplete liver glycogen stores.
*   Liver glycogen, typically 100-150 grams, takes 18-24 hours of fasting to deplete, signaling the need for alternative energy.
*   Unlike liver glycogen, muscle glycogen (300-500 grams) is primarily used for high-intensity activities (e.g., sprinting, weightlifting) and does not regulate overall energy homeostasis.
*   Depleting liver glycogen triggers the liver to produce ketone bodies from fatty acids, which can serve as an alternative fuel source for the brain (up to 70-80% after adaptation).
*   Strategies to accelerate liver glycogen depletion and fat burning include fasted cardio and adopting a low-carb diet, always in conjunction with a caloric deficit.

## The Challenge of Accessing Stored Body Fat
The human body is highly adaptive, storing excess energy in various sites like muscle tissue, bones, and body fat for survival. For individuals experiencing obesity or metabolic syndrome, the issue is not a lack of stored energy. Even very lean individuals (under 10% body fat) possess tens of thousands of calories in their adipose tissue. The core problem lies in how this stored energy is utilized, or rather, not utilized. To burn fat effectively, the body must be taught to use fat as a primary fuel source.

## The Role of Glycogen in Fat Burning
Before stored body fat can be burned, the liver's glycogen stores must be depleted. The liver plays a crucial role in metabolic processes and daily energy expenditure, with liver glycogen acting as a signaling repository. The rate at which the body begins burning fat depends on overall energy demands and the speed of liver glycogen depletion.

There are two main types of glycogen stores:

*   **Liver Glycogen:**
    *   Contains 100-150 grams of glycogen.
    *   Depletion typically takes 18-24 hours of fasting.
    *   Regulates energy homeostasis and blood sugar levels.
    *   Is constantly consumed by vital organs, including the brain, just by staying awake.

*   **Muscle Glycogen:**
    *   Contains 300-500 grams of glycogen.
    *   Has a different function than liver glycogen, primarily used for energy production during high-intensity activities.
    *   Tapped into when exceeding 65% of VO2 max, causing a switch from fat burning to glycogen burning.

## The Mechanism of Fat Burning and Ketosis
When liver glycogen is depleted, the liver transitions from burning glucose to producing ketone bodies.

**Metabolic Shift to Ketosis:**
Liver Glycogen Depletion -> Liver switches from glucose metabolism to fatty acid metabolism -> Production of Ketone Bodies -> Ketone bodies provide alternative fuel for the brain (meeting 70-80% of energy demands after keto-adaptation).

**Fat Utilization Process:**
Adipose Tissue (stores Triglyceride molecules) -> Release of Triglycerides into bloodstream -> Triglycerides burned for energy.

Ketone bodies are energy molecules created as a byproduct of fatty acid metabolism. Low glycogen stores prompt the liver to increase ketone body production, offering an alternative fuel source to glucose for the brain. To induce endogenous ketosis and start burning body fat, liver glycogen must be depleted, and the body must be in a caloric deficit through either caloric restriction or fasting.

## Strategies to Accelerate Fat Burning
While it takes approximately 20 hours to fully deplete liver glycogen, certain methods can speed up this process and accelerate fat loss.

**Protocols to Accelerate Fat Loss:**
*   **Engage in fasted cardio in the morning:** Exercising on an empty stomach burns through liver glycogen faster, potentially allowing access to body fat for fuel within 12 hours of not eating.
*   **Adopt a low-carb diet:** By limiting carbohydrate intake, the body is prevented from replenishing liver glycogen stores, thereby switching the liver into fat-burning mode more quickly.

It is crucial to remember that actual body fat loss still requires maintaining a caloric deficit over 24 hours. Depleting liver glycogen acts as a metabolic switch, promoting ketone production, activating autophagy, increasing glucagon (which further depletes liver glycogen), and priming the body to burn fat for fuel.

## Ketosis vs. Caloric Deficit for Sustainable Fat Loss
Body fat is broken down when the body needs to meet energetic demands. The fastest way to initiate body fat burning is to deplete liver glycogen through fasted cardio, followed by a continuous low-carb diet. This routine reduces glycogen availability, allowing for quicker access to stored body fat. If liver glycogen is refilled with carbohydrates, it must be depleted again before ketosis can resume.

While fat loss can occur on a non-ketogenic diet with high carbohydrates, provided a caloric deficit is maintained, ketosis offers distinct advantages:
*   **Enhanced Fat Burning:** When in a caloric deficit during ketosis, the body directly converts adipose tissue triglycerides into energy to compensate for the energy balance.
*   **Muscle Sparing:** Ketone bodies are highly muscle-sparing and anti-inflammatory. This makes them an ideal alternative fuel source for the brain and lean tissue during calorie restriction, when muscle catabolism might otherwise be more pronounced.

Therefore, for individuals aiming to preserve lean tissue during dieting, achieving ketosis as quickly as possible is a highly effective strategy.
