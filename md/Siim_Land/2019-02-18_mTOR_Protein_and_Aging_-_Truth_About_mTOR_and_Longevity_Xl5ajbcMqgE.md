# 2019-02-18 mTOR Protein and Aging - Truth About mTOR and Longevity

## Executive Summary
*   mTOR (mammalian Target of Rapamycin) is a central protein kinase that acts as a cellular fuel sensor, primarily regulating anabolic processes like cell growth, proliferation, and protein synthesis.
*   mTOR activity must be balanced: high activity promotes growth crucial in youth but is implicated in cancer/aging; low activity promotes catabolism (autophagy), essential for cellular renewal.
*   Optimal longevity involves cycling mTOR activity by balancing anabolic stimuli (protein, resistance exercise) with catabolic states (fasting, calorie restriction) to maintain muscle mass while promoting cellular cleanup.
*   Resistance training combined with intermittent fasting is presented as the ideal strategy to balance mTOR activation (for muscle building) and suppression (for autophagy/ketosis).

## The mTOR Signaling Pathway

mTOR is a protein kinase that functions as a fuel sensor, monitoring the energy status of cells.

### mTOR Complexes and Function
There are two complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2.
*   **mTORC1:** Functions primarily as a nutrient sensor controlling protein synthesis.
*   **mTORC2:** Regulates the actin cytoskeleton.
*   **Overall Function:** mTOR acts as an anabolic switch, turning on cellular growth processes throughout the body, including DNA repair, protein synthesis, angiogenesis, muscle building, and immune function.

### The Kinase Triad
mTORC1, AMPK, and YULK1 form a kinase triad that maintains energy and nutrient homeostasis by balancing each other based on the body's energetic conditions.

**Regulation Mechanism:**
Reduction in cellular energy $\rightarrow$ Activation of AMPK $\rightarrow$ Promotion of catabolic pathways $\rightarrow$ Suppression of mTORC1 (inhibiting muscle growth).

### Regulators of mTORC1 Activity

**Activators of mTORC1:**
*   Amino acids (Leucine is the most potent activator, promoting muscle protein synthesis).
*   Mechanical stimuli (resistance exercise).
*   Phosphatidic acid (regulated by exercise).
*   IGF-1 activity (Creatine may potentially promote mTORC1 via IGF-1 post-exercise).

**Inhibitors of mTORC1:**
*   Dietary protein restriction (especially amino acid deficiencies).
*   Calorie restriction (promotes autophagy).
*   Fasting (lowers glucose and insulin, suppressing mTOR while raising AMPK).
*   Ketogenic diets (moderate protein, low glucose).
*   Exercise (inhibits mTORC1 in liver and fat cells).
*   Metformin (lowers mTOR by reducing blood sugar and insulin).
*   Rapamycin (an immunosuppressant drug).
*   Curcumin (inhibits signaling in cancer cells).
*   Anthocyanins (found in blueberries/grapeseed extract, promoting AMPK and blocking mTOR).
*   Carnosine (retards mTOR signaling in gastric carcinoma cells).

## mTOR, Aging, and Disease

### mTOR and Cancer
*   Overexpression or dysfunction of mTOR is often related to various cancers and genetic disorders.
*   Inhibition of mTOR via diet or supplements (e.g., metformin, rapamycin) is used to treat cancer and tumor growth.
*   mTOR promotes the activation of insulin receptors and IGF-1 receptors, often accompanying increased glycolysis (the Warburg effect), which is common in cancer cells.
*   Inhibiting mTOR promotes autophagy, the catabolic pathway for cellular recycling. High mTOR activity may promote tumor growth by stopping autophagy from removing cancerous cells.

### mTOR and Longevity (The Goldilocks Zone)
mTOR's role shifts with age:
1.  **Youth:** mTOR is highly beneficial due to its role in stimulating growth and proliferation.
2.  **Aging:** While mTOR remains essential for maintaining muscle mass (combating sarcopenia), excessive signaling is detrimental.

**The Challenge of Aging:** As individuals age, testosterone and growth hormone decrease, and anabolic resistance increases, making muscle maintenance difficult. Therefore, adequate mTOR activation is **pro-longevity** in older adults to maintain lean tissue, but **too much mTOR is detrimental.**

**Consequences of Low mTOR:** Too little mTOR can predispose individuals to insulin problems (inability to shuttle glucose effectively), poor metabolic flexibility, and muscle loss.

### mTOR and Cognitive Health
mTOR signaling contributes to:
*   Neuroplasticity.
*   Learning and memory development.
*   Inhibiting age-related cognitive decline.
*   Growing synaptic connections.

## Optimizing mTOR Signaling

### The Problem with Extreme Protein Restriction
Overly restrictive low-protein diets risk causing anabolic resistance and muscle loss. Furthermore, even on a low-protein diet, mTOR may still be activated by sufficient carbohydrate intake, making long-term restriction unsustainable.

### The Intermittent Fasting Solution
Cycling between periods of low mTOR (fasting) and adequate mTOR (feeding) is more effective than sustained low protein intake.
*   **Fasting State:** Taps into deeper ketosis, allowing for caloric restriction without muscle loss while suppressing mTOR.
*   **Fed State (Post-Fast):** Adequate protein can be consumed to stimulate mTOR for muscle building.

### Recommended Balance for Health
For healthy individuals, the ideal strategy involves:
1.  **Intermittent Fasting:** To suppress mTOR and induce deep autophagy/ketosis regularly.
2.  **Resistance Training:** To utilize necessary mTOR activation for building lean muscle, which improves insulin sensitivity and promotes longevity.

**Conclusion:** Resistance training combined with intermittent fasting creates the perfect synergy to balance the need for autophagy (cellular cleanup) and sufficient mTOR stimulation (muscle maintenance and growth).
