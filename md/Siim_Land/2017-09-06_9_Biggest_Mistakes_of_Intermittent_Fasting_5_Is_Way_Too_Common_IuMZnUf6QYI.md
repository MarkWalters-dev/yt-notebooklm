# 2017-09-06 9 Biggest Mistakes of Intermittent Fasting 5 Is Way Too Common

### Executive Summary

*   Caffeine's appetite-suppressing effects diminish with regular use; cycling between decaf and regular coffee can help maintain sensitivity.
*   Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance are common during fasting due to increased water and electrolyte loss (exacerbated by coffee); adding a pinch of sea salt to water can improve fluid absorption and balance.
*   Short-term intermittent fasting (16-20 hours) stimulates beneficial cellular rejuvenation processes like autophagy and does not inherently cause muscle loss or health damage; however, psychological stress about fasting can be counterproductive.
*   Fasting is a form of hormetic stress, meaning its benefits are dose-dependent. Excessive concurrent stressors (e.g., lack of sleep, intense physical training, psychological stress) can overwhelm the body, potentially leading to adrenal burnout and negating fasting benefits.
*   It is crucial to listen to the body and not ignore signs of over-fasting, such as persistent headaches, severe fatigue, or shivering, as pushing too far can cause more harm than good.

## 1. Caffeine Dependence

Caffeine acts as an appetite suppressant, increases focus, and boosts energy. However, like insulin, the more it is consumed, the more resistant cells become to its effects, requiring higher doses for the same outcome. To maintain sensitivity to caffeine and ensure its continued benefits, limit intake to two to four cups of coffee per day.

To remain sensitive to caffeine:
*   Cycle between decaf and regular coffee (e.g., one day on, one day off).
*   Alternatively, drink caffeinated coffee for a week, then switch to decaf for a few days.

## 2. Dehydration Risk

Increasing water intake is crucial during fasting, as eight cups a day may not be sufficient. Coffee, being a diuretic, can further increase the loss of water and electrolytes through urination. To compensate for this and improve fluid absorption and electrolyte balance:
*   Add a pinch of sea salt to your water throughout the day.

## 3. Psychological Barriers

Short-term caloric deprivation, typically 16 to 20 hours, stimulates the body's internal rejuvenation mechanisms, such as autophagy. Fasting does not equal starvation, as the body accesses stored nutrients. Believing that fasting will damage the body creates additional, unnecessary mental stress that can be counterproductive.

Fasting provides an opportunity to reconceptualize hunger, helping individuals become more attuned to their bodies and identify the true origins of food cravings. Most hunger experienced is habitual, occurring at specific times of the day due to learned patterns, rather than an actual need for caloric survival.

## 4. Managing Overall Stress (Hormesis)

Fasting itself is a form of hormetic stress, meaning it provides positive adaptations when experienced in the right dose. However, if combined with other significant stressors, the overall burden on the body can become detrimental.

Additional stressors include:
*   **Physical training:** Intense exercise.
*   **Work stress:** High-pressure job environments.
*   **Relationship issues:** Personal conflicts or anxiety.
*   **Environmental factors:** Commuting stress (e.g., getting stuck in traffic).
*   **Cold exposure:** Feeling colder during fasting indicates the body is working harder to produce heat, adding to the body's stress response. To mitigate this, dress more warmly or consume hot beverages.
*   **Lack of sleep:** Sleep deprivation significantly contributes to overall stress. Most growth hormone is released during the initial hours of sleep, and sleep deprivation lowers testosterone and can induce insulin resistance. Crucially, many of the beneficial adaptations from hormesis occur during sleep.

When the body experiences multiple stressors, the sympathetic nervous system is stimulated, leading to the following process:
Sympathetic Nervous System -> Adrenal Glands -> Increased Adrenaline & Glucose Release

If the adrenal glands are consistently overwhelmed by excessive stress, they can eventually "burn out," leading to negative health consequences.

## 5. Gradual Fasting Progression

It is essential to gradually introduce and increase fasting durations to allow the body to adapt. Do not attempt long fasts immediately if your body is unaccustomed to them.

Recommended progression:
1.  Start with 14-hour fasts.
2.  Gradually increase to 16-hour fasts.
3.  Progress to 18-hour fasts.
4.  Finally, attempt your first 24-hour fast.

## 6. Post-Fasting Eating Habits

While intermittent fasting is effective for creating a caloric deficit, leading to fat loss, it is important not to negate these benefits by gorging on unhealthy foods after the fast. Though larger meals are expected, choosing nutrient-dense foods is crucial for overall health and energy. Adhering to an 80/20 rule (80% healthy, 20% occasional indulgences) can be acceptable, but the primary goal of nutrition should be to improve health and energy, not solely to manage caloric intake.

## 7. Recognizing Over-Fasting Signs

The positive effects of hormesis are dose-dependent. Pushing fasting too far can cause more harm than good. It is vital to be mindful of how your body reacts and to adjust your fasting schedule accordingly.

Signs of too much fasting or an overwhelmed system include:
*   Constant headaches
*   Persistent fatigue
*   Feeling "hit with a club"
*   Poor sleep quality
*   Shivering, even when dressed warmly
*   Problems with gallstones
*   Muscle loss
