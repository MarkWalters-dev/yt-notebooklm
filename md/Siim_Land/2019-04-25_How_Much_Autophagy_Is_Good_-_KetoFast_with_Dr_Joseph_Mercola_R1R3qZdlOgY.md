# 2019-04-25 How Much Autophagy Is Good - KetoFast with Dr Joseph Mercola

## Executive Summary

*   **EMF Exposure & Oxidative Stress:** Non-ionizing electromagnetic frequencies (EMFs) cause oxidative stress and DNA damage indirectly by catalyzing peroxynitrite production, leading to carbonate free radicals, similar to ionizing radiation.
*   **Fasting for NAD & Antioxidant Defense:** Intermittent fasting (16-18 hours daily) can increase NAD levels by 30% by upregulating NAMPT, an enzyme in the NAD salvage pathway, crucial for DNA repair. This approach also stimulates the body's natural antioxidant defense mechanisms (e.g., via NRF2 activation) far more effectively than exogenous antioxidant supplements.
*   **The KetoFast Protocol:** A cyclical approach combining daily intermittent fasting (6-8 hour eating window) with a 42-hour partial fast (300-500 calories of low-mTOR protein) 1-2 times per week. This partial fast is followed by a fasted strength training workout and then a refeed day with healthy carbs and higher protein (including branched-chain amino acids) to activate anabolic pathways.
*   **NADPH & Eating Timing:** Eating calorie-dense foods (especially fatty acids) right before bed significantly consumes NADPH to store calories as fat. This reduces the body's capacity to recharge antioxidants and repair cellular damage during sleep. It's recommended to stop eating 3-4 hours before sleep.
*   **Autophagy Cycling:** While autophagy is beneficial, daily activation is not optimal. It's more effective to cycle between catabolic (autophagy-activating) and anabolic (mTOR-activating) states, with intentional autophagy stimulation (e.g., through partial fasting and specific polyphenols) 1-2 times per week.

## EMF Exposure and Health

Electromagnetic frequencies (EMFs) cause oxidative stress and damage to the body, akin to X-ray radiation, even though EMFs are non-ionizing. While they lack the energy to directly break covalent bonds in DNA, they cause indirect damage through a specific mechanism:

**EMF Damage Mechanism:**
EMF Exposure -> Severe Oxidative Stress -> Catalysis of Peroxynitrite Production -> Formation of Carbonate Free Radicals (as dangerous as hydroxyl free radicals) -> Damage to cell membranes, proteins, enzymes, stem cells, mitochondria, and DNA.

Currently, there is limited research specifically on 5G due to its recent deployment. However, over 20,000 to 30,000 studies dating back to the 1950s and 60s document damage from non-ionizing radiation. 5G is an untested experiment with zero safety studies. The global deployment of 5G satellites means pervasive exposure, affecting not only humans but also plant and animal life.

**Protection Against EMFs:**
*   **Internal Strategies:**
    *   Increase magnesium intake, as magnesium acts as a calcium channel blocker, interfering with the mechanism of EMF harm.
    *   Strengthen the body's natural antioxidant system through hormesis (e.g., fasting, exercise, sauna, cold exposure), which activates NRF2 and antioxidant response elements.
    *   Optimize sleep in an EMF-free environment, as repair mechanisms primarily occur during sleep.
    *   Increase NAD levels through fasting, as NAD fuels PARP, an enzyme vital for DNA repair.
*   **External Strategies:**
    *   Shield home and office environments from EMFs using appropriate materials. Measuring devices can confirm shielding effectiveness.
    *   Awareness of pervasive exposure in public spaces, as shielding outside the home is difficult.

## The Role of Autophagy and Hormesis

Activating autophagy on a regular basis radically improves health through hormetic mechanisms, primarily NRF2 and other pathways, leading to an increased production of endogenous antioxidants. This strategy is significantly more effective than ingesting antioxidant supplements.

**NAD and DNA Repair:**
NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is crucial for DNA repair. The enzyme PARP (poly ADP ribose polymerase) is the primary consumer of NAD+. PARP utilizes ADP subunits from approximately 150 NAD+ molecules to create a polymer matrix that facilitates DNA repair enzymes in fixing single or double-stranded DNA breaks. If DNA damage is extensive, NAD levels plummet, leading to metabolic catastrophe. Fasting can increase NAD levels by 30% through the salvage pathway, specifically by increasing NAMPT, the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway.

**NADPH and Timing of Eating:**
NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) is equally important to NAD, serving as the "battery" that stores reductive potential to recharge antioxidants.

**NADPH Consumption during Fat Creation:**
Calories Consumed Before Bed (especially fat) -> Body needs to store calories as fat -> Fatty Acid Creation -> Significant Consumption of NADPH -> Reduced NADPH Levels -> Impaired Ability to Recharge Antioxidants & Repair Cellular Damage During Nighttime.

It is recommended to stop eating 3-4 hours before sleep to avoid consuming NADPH for fat storage, allowing the body to prioritize antioxidant recharging and cellular repair during rest.

**Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs):**
HSPs play a crucial role in protein quality control. Approximately 30% of newly synthesized proteins are misfolded.
**HSP Mechanism:**
Misfolded Proteins -> Heat Shock Proteins Attempt to Refold Correctly -> If Repairable: Protein is Refolded.
If Severely Misfolded (damaged beyond repair): HSPs facilitate ubiquitination (adding ubiquitin molecules) -> Activation of Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) -> Targeted Destruction of Damaged Protein.
HSPs are considered a subset or "cousin strategy" of autophagy, as both pathways deal with clearing damaged cellular components. Heat, particularly from near-infrared saunas (which also provide photobiomodulation), is a significant stimulator of HSPs.

## KetoFast Protocol

The KetoFast program is designed as a cyclical approach to metabolic health, emphasizing periods of restricted eating followed by refeeding, and is generally performed 1-2 times per week for individuals who are not underweight, pregnant, breastfeeding, or experiencing eating disorders.

**Contraindications:** Underweight, eating disorders, breastfeeding, or pregnancy.

### KetoFast Steps:

1.  **Intermittent Fasting (Daily Baseline):** Restrict eating window to 6-8 hours daily (e.g., 9 AM to 3 PM or 10 AM to 6 PM). This establishes a baseline level of autophagy.
2.  **Partial Fast (1-2 times/week):**
    *   **Day 1 (Intermittent Fasting):** Follow the regular 6-8 hour eating window.
    *   **Day 2 (Partial Fast Meal):** At the normal eating window start time (e.g., 9 AM), consume a single meal of 300-500 calories (based on lean body mass). This meal should be:
        *   Very low in carbohydrates (less than 10 grams).
        *   Relatively low in fat.
        *   Primarily protein (at least half the normal daily protein intake).
        *   Proteins should be low in mTOR-stimulating amino acids (e.g., branched-chain amino acids, glutamine). Suitable options include vegan proteins (like chlorella) or organic bone broth (rich in glycine, proline, hydroxyproline).
        *   **Note:** Organic bone broth is crucial to avoid glyphosate concentration in connective tissues.
    *   **Extended Fast:** Do not eat for another 24 hours after this partial fast meal, resulting in a 42-hour period with only 300-500 calories consumed.
3.  **Refeed & Anabolic Kick (Post-Fast):**
    *   **Fasted Workout:** After the 42-hour fast, perform a strength training workout while still in a fasted state. This takes advantage of high growth hormone levels (with relatively inhibited growth hormone receptors, meaning IGF-1 is not significantly increased) to maximize the anabolic response.
    *   **Feast:** Immediately after the workout, "feast" on healthy foods including:
        *   Healthy carbohydrates (e.g., fruits, yams, sweet potatoes).
        *   Proteins, including those high in branched-chain amino acids (e.g., whey protein concentrate) and glutamine, to fully activate mTOR and maximize muscle growth and recovery.

**Benefits of KetoFast:**
*   **Autophagy Activation:** Pushes autophagy significantly beyond baseline intermittent fasting.
*   **Metabolic Flexibility:** Enhances the body's ability to switch between fuel sources.
*   **Detoxification:** Provides protein needed to fuel detoxification systems during fat burning, unlike extended water fasting.
*   **Ketone Production:** Increases ketones, which are protective against ionizing radiation, especially beneficial during air travel.
*   **NAD & NADPH Boost:** Dramatically increases NAD and NADPH levels, critical for DNA repair and antioxidant recharge.
*   **Stem Cell Activation:** Activates stem cells, particularly when combined with strength training.

## Distinction from Water Fasting and Fasting Mimicking Diet

**Concerns with Extended Water Fasting (Multiple Days):**
*   **Toxin Release:** In the 21st century, most people are exposed to tens of thousands of fat-soluble toxins stored in fat cells. During extended water fasts, burning fat liberates these toxins, and without adequate nutrient intake, the detoxification system struggles to excrete them efficiently.
*   **Difficulty & Compliance:** Extended water fasts are challenging and impractical for most people, leading to low compliance.
*   **Frequency Limitations:** For healthy individuals, frequent multi-day water fasts can lead to excessive weight loss and may be detrimental. They are primarily suitable for those with significant metabolic damage (e.g., morbid obesity) and should be done under supervision in a restful environment without strenuous activity.

**Comparison with Valter Longo's Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD/Prolon):**
*   Longo's FMD involves a 5-day partial fast with higher calorie intake (e.g., 1000 calories on day 1, then 700 calories for the next four days) compared to KetoFast's 42-hour, 300-500 calorie partial fast.
*   KetoFast is generally lower in carbs and higher in protein (from specific sources like bone broth) on fasting days, whereas FMD tends to be higher in carbs and very low in protein.
*   KetoFast's specific protein choices (e.g., collagen, chlorella) are designed to support detoxification and preserve lean muscle mass without over-activating mTOR during the catabolic phase.
*   KetoFast can be done more frequently (1-2 times/week, over 100 times/year) compared to FMD (typically once a month or quarter), allowing for more consistent autophagy activation.

## Autophagy Activation and Cycling

Autophagy is beneficial, but continuous activation is not ideal and can even promote tumor cell survival. The key is balance and cycling between catabolic (autophagy-activating) and anabolic (mTOR-activating) states.

**Polyphenols for Autophagy Stimulation:**
Specific polyphenols can activate autophagy, and their use should be cyclical, typically on partial fast days.
*   **Sources:**
    *   **Cruciferous Vegetables:** Glucosinolates (e.g., glucoraphanin in broccoli, cauliflower) are converted by myrosinase into sulforaphane. Sulforaphane activates NRF2, upregulates glutathione production, and increases heat shock proteins. Broccoli sprouts are a potent source.
    *   **Resveratrol**
    *   **Fisetin**
    *   **Berberine**
    *   **Curcumin**
    *   **Quercetin**
    *   **Pterostilbene**
    *   **EGCG (from green tea)**
    *   **Pomegranate Peel:** Contains ellagic acid and ellagitannins, which the gut microbiome converts into urolithin A. The peel, not the fruit, holds most of the polyphenols. Pomegranate peel powder can be very bitter.
    *   **Coffee**
    *   **Raw Cacao (beans or nibs):** High concentration of polyphenols.

These polyphenols are taken before sleep on partial fast days and again in the morning before the first meal on refeed days to maximize autophagy activation during prolonged fasting windows. Consistent daily use of these potent autophagy activators is not recommended.

**What "Breaks a Fast":**
From a theoretical perspective, any calories impair autophagy. However, a small amount (e.g., 1-2 calories from green tea) will have a minimal impact, especially during a multi-day fast. A significant dent in autophagy likely occurs with 50-100 calories. The type of calories matters; branched-chain amino acids are more mTOR-stimulating than polyphenols. Anything that significantly raises insulin (e.g., sugary drinks) will put the brakes on autophagy.

## Refeed Day Nutrition

On refeed days, after a fasted workout, the goal is to feast on nutrient-dense foods to stimulate anabolic pathways.
*   **Fruits:** Blueberries, mangoes, plums, cherries, apricots, tangerines, avocados.
*   **Healthy Carbohydrates:** Yams, sweet potatoes (cooked, with raw butter and healthy salt).
*   **High-Quality Protein:** Whey protein concentrate (for high branched-chain amino acids), other clean protein sources.
*   **Glutamine:** May be included to support muscle recovery.

## Protein and Longevity

The concern that high protein intake is damaging due to mTOR activation is often oversimplified. A cyclical approach is key, where protein intake is moderated on partial fast days (e.g., 40-45 grams) and higher (over 100 grams) on refeed days.

**Collagen Protein:** A significant portion of daily protein intake (e.g., 30 grams) can come from collagen protein (from organic bone broth or supplements). Collagen is rich in specific amino acids like glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline, which do very little to activate mTOR, making it a "safe" protein for general intake.

**Benefits of Glycine:**
*   Increases NADPH levels.
*   Helps protect against glyphosate damage.
*   Is a precursor for glutathione synthesis (a crucial endogenous antioxidant). Boosting the body's own glutathione production is preferred over exogenous supplementation.

## Final Recommendations for Longevity

To live a long, healthy life with full function, mobility, high bone density, and cognitive function into old age:

*   **Regular Discipline:** Implement consistent, cyclical health strategies.
*   **Quality Sleep:** Prioritize 8-9 hours of sleep per night in an EMF-free environment.
*   **Cyclical Ketosis:** Embrace the benefits of ketosis and cyclical ketogenic approaches (like KetoFast).
*   **Strength Training:** Focus on functional body movement and strength training, rather than excessive long-duration endurance cardio.
*   **Prevention:** These strategies can prevent almost every degenerative disease (e.g., cataracts, Alzheimer's, diabetes, obesity, heart disease, cancer). The body is designed for self-repair and regeneration, and given the right tools, it will maintain health.
*   **Conscious Food Choices:** Avoid processed foods and prioritize preparing your own healthy meals.
*   **The "Refeed Miracle":** The true miracle of fasting occurs during the refeed phase, where the body rebuilds and rejuvenates after the catabolic state.
