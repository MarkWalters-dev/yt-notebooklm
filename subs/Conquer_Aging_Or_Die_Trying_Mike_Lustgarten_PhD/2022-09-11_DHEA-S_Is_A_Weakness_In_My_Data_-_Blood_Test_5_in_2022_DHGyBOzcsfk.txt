In my last video, I ended by asking the question, are there weaknesses in my blood test data? And I highlighted a total cholesterol of 133 as a potential problem. So, in today's video, let's start off by investigating what's optimal for total cholesterol. And we can see that here. So, starting with the hazard ratio for all cause mortality on the Y-axis, plotted against blood levels of cholesterol on the X, and this data is in 45 to 50-year-olds, 54-year-olds, or more specifically, 44 to 55-year-olds, which is what was included in the supplementary data for the paper. And if you're interested in looking at this paper, this and all of the papers in this video will be in the video's description. So, note that this is more than 3.3 million subjects in this age range. And my chronological age is within this age range of 44 to 55, so it may be most relevant to me.

So, starting with the reference, which was defined as 220 to 229 for total cholesterol. And when putting my data into perspective, we can see that a total cholesterol of 133 milligrams per deciliter is associated with more than a twofold increased all cause mortality risk. And superficially, this is bad news.

So, let's take a look at the aging data for a little bit more perspective. And note that low total cholesterol is found in youth, but also in older ages, which is what we can see here. So, this is the larger study based on the study on the left. And this includes total cholesterol on the Y-axis, plotted against age of entry on the X. So, this age range goes from 18 to 88 years. So, what we can see for both men and women is that low total cholesterol is found in youth, somewhere in the 160 to 170 range, depending on if you're a man or a woman. And then total cholesterol peaks somewhere around 50 for both men and women. And after which we can see then an age-related decline, such that if we extrapolate further to about 100 years old or older, and I covered this in an earlier video, and if you missed that, it'll be in the right corner. We can see that relatively low total cholesterol can also be found in advanced age, including centenarians.

So, how can we know if low total cholesterol is reflective of youth or aging and increased all cause mortality risk? So, low total cholesterol within the context of other youthful biomarkers is associated with a decreased all cause mortality risk. And that's what we can see here. So, on the Y-axis we've got relative risk for all cause mortality. And this is in people with total cholesterol less than 160, and varying levels of albumin, A L B, and HDL cholesterol, HDL C. And note that this data is in a very small study, it only included 393 people. So, this may not be what actually ends up being the truth for people who have a relatively low total cholesterol. We'll need more studies in this area. But note this study was published in 2001, and I haven't come across any other studies, including the study on the left, that adjusted their data for things like albumin, for example. So, this is a 79-year-old, and let's get into the data.

So, when compared with the hazard ratio of one, when the brackets or 95% confidence interval is completely below one, as indicated by the green arrow there, we have a significant effect, statistically significant effect. In contrast, when the 95% confidence interval overlaps with one, as shown there, that effect is not statistically significant.

So, let's start off by defining the aged phenotype. And in this case, the reference actually ended up being having higher all cause mortality risk. So, in that case, this was people that had a total cholesterol less than 160 and relatively low albumin and HDL cholesterol, less than 38 for albumin and less than 47 for HDL. And the reason that's the aged phenotype is because I showed in the earlier slide that relatively low total cholesterol can be found in advanced age. So, we've got total cholesterol less than 160. And then albumin and HDL decline during aging. So, we see relatively lower albumin and HDL in people with advanced age. So, combined, low total cholesterol, low albumin, low HDL. That's the aged phenotype. What about when HDL is relatively higher within that context? And then as I mentioned, we can see that the 95% confidence interval overlaps with one. So, this is not significantly different from the reference. So, we can conclude that higher HDL, relatively higher HDL, doesn't impact all cause mortality risk when we have relatively low total cholesterol and low albumin.

What about when albumin is relatively high, as shown there? And now we have a significant effect. And I've defined this as the close to youthful phenotype because relatively low total cholesterol and relatively higher albumin are found in youth. So, again, this is a 79-year-old.

So, when compared with the reference, which was defined as 220 to 229 for total cholesterol. And when putting my data into perspective, we can see that a total cholesterol of 133 milligrams per deciliter is associated with more than a twofold increased all cause mortality risk.

So, low total cholesterol within the context of other youthful biomarkers is associated with a decreased all cause mortality risk. And that's what we can see here. So, on the Y-axis we've got relative risk for all cause mortality. And this is in people with total cholesterol less than 160, and varying levels of albumin, A L B, and HDL cholesterol, HDL C. And note that this data is in a very small study, it only included 393 people. So, this may not be what actually ends up being the truth for people who have a relatively low total cholesterol. We'll need more studies in this area. But note this study was published in 2001, and I haven't come across any other studies, including the study on the left, that adjusted their data for things like albumin, for example. So, this is a 79-year-old, and let's get into the data.

So, when compared with the hazard ratio of one, when the brackets or 95% confidence interval is completely below one, as indicated by the green arrow there, we have a significant effect, statistically significant effect. In contrast, when the 95% confidence interval overlaps with one, as shown there, that effect is not statistically significant.

So, let's start off by defining the aged phenotype. And in this case, the reference actually ended up being having higher all cause mortality risk. So, in that case, this was people that had a total cholesterol less than 160 and relatively low albumin and HDL cholesterol, less than 38 for albumin and less than 47 for HDL. And the reason that's the aged phenotype is because I showed in the earlier slide that relatively low total cholesterol can be found in advanced age. So, we've got total cholesterol less than 160. And then albumin and HDL decline during aging. So, we see relatively lower albumin and HDL in people with advanced age. So, combined, low total cholesterol, low albumin, low HDL. That's the aged phenotype. What about when HDL is relatively higher within that context? And then as I mentioned, we can see that the 95% confidence interval overlaps with one. So, this is not significantly different from the reference. So, we can conclude that higher HDL, relatively higher HDL, doesn't impact all cause mortality risk when we have relatively low total cholesterol and low albumin.

What about when albumin is relatively high, as shown there? And now we have a significant effect. And I've defined this as the close to youthful phenotype because relatively low total cholesterol and relatively higher albumin are found in youth. So, again, this is a 79-year-old.

So, when compared with the reference, which was defined as 220 to 229 for total cholesterol. And when putting my data into perspective, we can see that a total cholesterol of 133 milligrams per deciliter is associated with more than a twofold increased all cause mortality risk. And superficially, this is bad news.

So, let's take a look at the aging data for a little bit more perspective. And note that low total cholesterol is found in youth, but also in older ages, which is what we can see here. So, this is the larger study based on the study on the left. And this includes total cholesterol on the Y-axis, plotted against age of entry on the X. So, this age range goes from 18 to 88 years. So, what we can see for both men and women is that low total cholesterol is found in youth, somewhere in the 160 to 170 range, depending on if you're a man or a woman. And then total cholesterol peaks somewhere around 50 for both men and women. And after which we can see then an age-related decline, such that if we extrapolate further to about 100 years old or older, and I covered this in an earlier video, and if you missed that, it'll be in the right corner. We can see that relatively low total cholesterol can also be found in advanced age, including centenarians.

So, we can conclude that higher HDL, relatively higher HDL, doesn't impact all cause mortality risk when we have relatively low total cholesterol and low albumin.

What about when albumin is relatively high, as shown there? And now we have a significant effect. And I've defined this as the close to youthful phenotype because relatively low total cholesterol and relatively higher albumin are found in youth. So, again, this is a 79-year-old.

So, when compared with the reference, which was defined as 220 to 229 for total cholesterol. And when putting my data into perspective, we can see that a total cholesterol of 133 milligrams per deciliter is associated with more than a twofold increased all cause mortality risk. And superficially, this is bad news.

So, let's take a look at the aging data for a little bit more perspective. And note that low total cholesterol is found in youth, but also in older ages, which is what we can see here. So, this is the larger study based on the study on the left. And this includes total cholesterol on the Y-axis, plotted against age of entry on the X. So, this age range goes from 18 to 88 years. So, what we can see for both men and women is that low total cholesterol is found in youth, somewhere in the 160 to 170 range, depending on if you're a man or a woman. And then total cholesterol peaks somewhere around 50 for both men and women. And after which we can see then an age-related decline, such that if we extrapolate further to about 100 years old or older, and I covered this in an earlier video, and if you missed that, it'll be in the right corner. We can see that relatively low total cholesterol can also be found in advanced age, including centenarians.

So, how can we know if low total cholesterol is reflective of youth or aging and increased all cause mortality risk? So, low total cholesterol within the context of other youthful biomarkers is associated with a decreased all cause mortality risk. And that's what we can see here. So, on the Y-axis we've got relative risk for all cause mortality. And this is in people with total cholesterol less than 160, and varying levels of albumin, A L B, and HDL cholesterol, HDL C. And note that this data is in a very small study, it only included 393 people. So, this may not be what actually ends up being the truth for people who have a relatively low total cholesterol. We'll need more studies in this area. But note this study was published in 2001, and I haven't come across any other studies, including the study on the left, that adjusted their data for things like albumin, for example. So, this is a 79-year-old, and let's get into the data.

So, when compared with the hazard ratio of one, when the brackets or 95% confidence interval is completely below one, as indicated by the green arrow there, we have a significant effect, statistically significant effect. In contrast, when the 95% confidence interval overlaps with one, as shown there, that effect is not statistically significant.

So, let's start off by defining the aged phenotype. And in this case, the reference actually ended up being having higher all cause mortality risk. So, in that case, this was people that had a total cholesterol less than 160 and relatively low albumin and HDL cholesterol, less than 38 for albumin and less than 47 for HDL. And the reason that's the aged phenotype is because I showed in the earlier slide that relatively low total cholesterol can be found in advanced age. So, we've got total cholesterol less than 160. And then albumin and HDL decline during aging. So, we see relatively lower albumin and HDL in people with advanced age. So, combined, low total cholesterol, low albumin, low HDL. That's the aged phenotype. What about when HDL is relatively higher within that context? And then as I mentioned, we can see that the 95% confidence interval overlaps with one. So, this is not significantly different from the reference.

So, on the Y-axis we've got relative risk for all cause mortality. And this is in people with total cholesterol less than 160, and varying levels of albumin, A L B, and HDL cholesterol, HDL C. And note that this data is in a very small study, it only included 393 people. So, this may not be what actually ends up being the truth for people who have a relatively low total cholesterol. We'll need more studies in this area. But note this study was published in 2001, and I haven't come across any other studies, including the study on the left, that adjusted their data for things like albumin, for example. So, this is a 79-year-old, and let's get into the data.

So, when compared with the hazard ratio of one, when the brackets or 95% confidence interval is completely below one, as indicated by the green arrow there, we have a significant effect, statistically significant effect. In contrast, when the 95% confidence interval overlaps with one, as shown there, that effect is not statistically significant.

So, let's start off by defining the aged phenotype. And in this case, the reference actually ended up being having higher all cause mortality risk. So, in that case, this was people that had a total cholesterol less than 160 and relatively low albumin and HDL cholesterol, less than 38 for albumin and less than 47 for HDL. And the reason that's the aged phenotype is because I showed in the earlier slide that relatively low total cholesterol can be found in advanced age. So, we've got total cholesterol less than 160. And then albumin and HDL decline during aging. So, we see relatively lower albumin and HDL in people with advanced age. So, combined, low total cholesterol, low albumin, low HDL. That's the aged phenotype. What about when HDL is relatively higher within that context? And then as I mentioned, we can see that the 95% confidence interval overlaps with one. So, this is not significantly different from the reference. So, we can conclude that higher HDL, relatively higher HDL, doesn't impact all cause mortality risk when we have relatively low total cholesterol and low albumin.

What about when albumin is relatively high, as shown there? And now we have a significant effect. And I've defined this as the close to youthful phenotype because relatively low total cholesterol and relatively higher albumin are found in youth. So, again, this is a 79-year-old.

So, when compared with the reference, which was defined as 220 to 229 for total cholesterol. And when putting my data into perspective, we can see that a total cholesterol of 133 milligrams per deciliter is associated with more than a twofold increased all cause mortality risk. And superficially, this is bad news.

So, let's take a look at the aging data for a little bit more perspective. And note that low total cholesterol is found in youth, but also in older ages, which is what we can see here. So, this is the larger study based on the study on the left. And this includes total cholesterol on the Y-axis, plotted against age of entry on the X. So, this age range goes from 18 to 88 years. So, what we can see for both men and women is that low total cholesterol is found in youth, somewhere in the 160 to 170 range, depending on if you're a man or a woman. And then total cholesterol peaks somewhere around 50 for both men and women. And after which we can see then an age-related decline, such that if we extrapolate further to about 100 years old or older, and I covered this in an earlier video, and if you missed that, it'll be in the right corner. We can see that relatively low total cholesterol can also be found in advanced age, including centenarians.

So, how can we know if low total cholesterol is reflective of youth or aging and increased all cause mortality risk?

What about when albumin is relatively high, as shown there? And now we have a significant effect. And I've defined this as the close to youthful phenotype because relatively low total cholesterol and relatively higher albumin are found in youth. So, again, this is a 79-year-old.

So, when compared with the reference, which was defined as 220 to 229 for total cholesterol. And when putting my data into perspective, we can see that a total cholesterol of 133 milligrams per deciliter is associated with more than a twofold increased all cause mortality risk. And superficially, this is bad news.

So, let's take a look at the aging data for a little bit more perspective. And note that low total cholesterol is found in youth, but also in older ages, which is what we can see here. So, this is the larger study based on the study on the left. And this includes total cholesterol on the Y-axis, plotted against age of entry on the X. So, this age range goes from 18 to 88 years. So, what we can see for both men and women is that low total cholesterol is found in youth, somewhere in the 160 to 170 range, depending on if you're a man or a woman. And then total cholesterol peaks somewhere around 50 for both men and women. And after which we can see then an age-related decline, such that if we extrapolate further to about 100 years old or older, and I covered this in an earlier video, and if you missed that, it'll be in the right corner. We can see that relatively low total cholesterol can also be found in advanced age, including centenarians.

So, how can we know if low total cholesterol is reflective of youth or aging and increased all cause mortality risk? So, low total cholesterol within the context of other youthful biomarkers is associated with a decreased all cause mortality risk. And that's what we can see here. So, on the Y-axis we've got relative risk for all cause mortality. And this is in people with total cholesterol less than 160, and varying levels of albumin, A L B, and HDL cholesterol, HDL C. And note that this data is in a very small study, it only included 393 people. So, this may not be what actually ends up being the truth for people who have a relatively low total cholesterol. We'll need more studies in this area. But note this study was published in 2001, and I haven't come across any other studies, including the study on the left, that adjusted their data for things like albumin, for example. So, this is a 79-year-old, and let's get into the data.

So, when compared with the hazard ratio of one, when the brackets or 95% confidence interval is completely below one, as indicated by the green arrow there, we have a significant effect, statistically significant effect. In contrast, when the 95% confidence interval overlaps with one, as shown there, that effect is not statistically significant.

So, let's start off by defining the aged phenotype. And in this case, the reference actually ended up being having higher all cause mortality risk. So, in that case, this was people that had a total cholesterol less than 160 and relatively low albumin and HDL cholesterol, less than 38 for albumin and less than 47 for HDL. And the reason that's the aged phenotype is because I showed in the earlier slide that relatively low total cholesterol can be found in advanced age. So, we've got total cholesterol less than 160. And then albumin and HDL decline during aging. So, we see relatively lower albumin and HDL in people with advanced age. So, combined, low total cholesterol, low albumin, low HDL. That's the aged phenotype. What about when HDL is relatively higher within that context? And then as I mentioned, we can see that the 95% confidence interval overlaps with one. So, this is not significantly different from the reference. So, we can conclude that higher HDL, relatively higher HDL, doesn't impact all cause mortality risk when we have relatively low total cholesterol and low albumin.

And note that this data is in a very small study, it only included 393 people. So, this may not be what actually ends up being the truth for people who have a relatively low total cholesterol. We'll need more studies in this area. But note this study was published in 2001, and I haven't come across any other studies, including the study on the left, that adjusted their data for things like albumin, for example. So, this is a 79-year-old, and let's get into the data.

So, when compared with the hazard ratio of one, when the brackets or 95% confidence interval is completely below one, as indicated by the green arrow there, we have a significant effect, statistically significant effect. In contrast, when the 95% confidence interval overlaps with one, as shown there, that effect is not statistically significant.

So, let's start off by defining the aged phenotype. And in this case, the reference actually ended up being having higher all cause mortality risk. So, in that case, this was people that had a total cholesterol less than 160 and relatively low albumin and HDL cholesterol, less than 38 for albumin and less than 47 for HDL. And the reason that's the aged phenotype is because I showed in the earlier slide that relatively low total cholesterol can be found in advanced age. So, we've got total cholesterol less than 160. And then albumin and HDL decline during aging. So, we see relatively lower albumin and HDL in people with advanced age. So, combined, low total cholesterol, low albumin, low HDL. That's the aged phenotype. What about when HDL is relatively higher within that context? And then as I mentioned, we can see that the 95% confidence interval overlaps with one. So, this is not significantly different from the reference. So, we can conclude that higher HDL, relatively higher HDL, doesn't impact all cause mortality risk when we have relatively low total cholesterol and low albumin.

What about when albumin is relatively high, as shown there? And now we have a significant effect. And I've defined this as the close to youthful phenotype because relatively low total cholesterol and relatively higher albumin are found in youth. So, again, this is a 79-year-old.

So, when compared with the reference, which was defined as 220 to 229 for total cholesterol. And when putting my data into perspective, we can see that a total cholesterol of 133 milligrams per deciliter is associated with more than a twofold increased all cause mortality risk. And superficially, this is bad news.

So, let's take a look at the aging data for a little bit more perspective. And note that low total cholesterol is found in youth, but also in older ages, which is what we can see here. So, this is the larger study based on the study on the left. And this includes total cholesterol on the Y-axis, plotted against age of entry on the X. So, this age range goes from 18 to 88 years. So, what we can see for both men and women is that low total cholesterol is found in youth, somewhere in the 160 to 170 range, depending on if you're a man or a woman. And then total cholesterol peaks somewhere around 50 for both men and women. And after which we can see then an age-related decline, such that if we extrapolate further to about 100 years old or older, and I covered this in an earlier video, and if you missed that, it'll be in the right corner. We can see that relatively low total cholesterol can also be found in advanced age, including centenarians.

So, how can we know if low total cholesterol is reflective of youth or aging and increased all cause mortality risk? So, low total cholesterol within the context of other youthful biomarkers is associated with a decreased all cause mortality risk. And that's what we can see here. So, on the Y-axis we've got relative risk for all cause mortality. And this is in people with total cholesterol less than 160, and varying levels of albumin, A L B, and HDL cholesterol, HDL C.

What about when albumin is relatively high, as shown there? And now we have a significant effect. And I've defined this as the close to youthful phenotype because relatively low total cholesterol and relatively higher albumin are found in youth. So, again, this is a 79-year-old.

So, when compared with the reference, which was defined as 220 to 229 for total cholesterol. And when putting my data into perspective, we can see that a total cholesterol of 133 milligrams per deciliter is associated with more than a twofold increased all cause mortality risk. And superficially, this is bad news.

So, let's take a look at the aging data for a little bit more perspective. And note that low total cholesterol is found in youth, but also in older ages, which is what we can see here. So, this is the larger study based on the study on the left. And this includes total cholesterol on the Y-axis, plotted against age of entry on the X. So, this age range goes from 18 to 88 years. So, what we can see for both men and women is that low total cholesterol is found in youth, somewhere in the 160 to 170 range, depending on if you're a man or a woman. And then total cholesterol peaks somewhere around 50 for both men and women. And after which we can see then an age-related decline, such that if we extrapolate further to about 100 years old or older, and I covered this in an earlier video, and if you missed that, it'll be in the right corner. We can see that relatively low total cholesterol can also be found in advanced age, including centenarians.

So, how can we know if low total cholesterol is reflective of youth or aging and increased all cause mortality risk? So, low total cholesterol within the context of other youthful biomarkers is associated with a decreased all cause mortality risk. And that's what we can see here. So, on the Y-axis we've got relative risk for all cause mortality. And this is in people with total cholesterol less than 160, and varying levels of albumin, A L B, and HDL cholesterol, HDL C. And note that this data is in a very small study, it only included 393 people. So, this may not be what actually ends up being the truth for people who have a relatively low total cholesterol. We'll need more studies in this area. But note this study was published in 2001, and I haven't come across any other studies, including the study on the left, that adjusted their data for things like albumin, for example. So, this is a 79-year-old, and let's get into the data.

So, when compared with the hazard ratio of one, when the brackets or 95% confidence interval is completely below one, as indicated by the green arrow there, we have a significant effect, statistically significant effect. In contrast, when the 95% confidence interval overlaps with one, as shown there, that effect is not statistically significant.

So, let's start off by defining the aged phenotype. And in this case, the reference actually ended up being having higher all cause mortality risk. So, in that case, this was people that had a total cholesterol less than 160 and relatively low albumin and HDL cholesterol, less than 38 for albumin and less than 47 for HDL. And the reason that's the aged phenotype is because I showed in the earlier slide that relatively low total cholesterol can be found in advanced age. So, we've got total cholesterol less than 160. And then albumin and HDL decline during aging. So, we see relatively lower albumin and HDL in people with advanced age. So, combined, low total cholesterol, low albumin, low HDL. That's the aged phenotype. What about when HDL is relatively higher within that context? And then as I mentioned, we can see that the 95% confidence interval overlaps with one. So, this is not significantly different from the reference. So, we can conclude that higher HDL, relatively higher HDL, doesn't impact all cause mortality risk when we have relatively low total cholesterol and low albumin.

And note that this data is in a very small study, it only included 393 people. So, this may not be what actually ends up being the truth for people who have a relatively low total cholesterol. We'll need more studies in this area. But note this study was published in 2001, and I haven't come across any other studies, including the study on the left, that adjusted their data for things like albumin, for example. So, this is a 79-year-old, and let's get into the data.

So, when compared with the hazard ratio of one, when the brackets or 95% confidence interval is completely below one, as indicated by the green arrow there, we have a significant effect, statistically significant effect. In contrast, when the 95% confidence interval overlaps with one, as shown there, that effect is not statistically significant.

So, let's start off by defining the aged phenotype. And in this case, the reference actually ended up being having higher all cause mortality risk. So, in that case, this was people that had a total cholesterol less than 160 and relatively low albumin and HDL cholesterol, less than 38 for albumin and less than 47 for HDL. And the reason that's the aged phenotype is because I showed in the earlier slide that relatively low total cholesterol can be found in advanced age. So, we've got total cholesterol less than 160. And then albumin and HDL decline during aging. So, we see relatively lower albumin and HDL in people with advanced age. So, combined, low total cholesterol, low albumin, low HDL. That's the aged phenotype. What about when HDL is relatively higher within that context? And then as I mentioned, we can see that the 95% confidence interval overlaps with one. So, this is not significantly different from the reference. So, we can conclude that higher HDL, relatively higher HDL, doesn't impact all cause mortality risk when we have relatively low total cholesterol and low albumin.

What about when albumin is relatively high, as shown there? And now we have a significant effect. And I've defined this as the close to youthful phenotype because relatively low total cholesterol and relatively higher albumin are found in youth. So, again, this is a 79-year-old.

So, when compared with the reference, which was defined as 220 to 229 for total cholesterol. And when putting my data into perspective, we can see that a total cholesterol of 133 milligrams per deciliter is associated with more than a twofold increased all cause mortality risk. And superficially, this is bad news.

So, let's take a look at the aging data for a little bit more perspective. And note that low total cholesterol is found in youth, but also in older ages, which is what we can see here. So, this is the larger study based on the study on the left. And this includes total cholesterol on the Y-axis, plotted against age of entry on the X. So, this age range goes from 18 to 88 years. So, what we can see for both men and women is that low total cholesterol is found in youth, somewhere in the 160 to 170 range, depending on if you're a man or a woman. And then total cholesterol peaks somewhere around 50 for both men and women. And after which we can see then an age-related decline, such that if we extrapolate further to about 100 years old or older, and I covered this in an earlier video, and if you missed that, it'll be in the right corner. We can see that relatively low total cholesterol can also be found in advanced age, including centenarians.

So, how can we know if low total cholesterol is reflective of youth or aging and increased all cause mortality risk? So, low total cholesterol within the context of other youthful biomarkers is associated with a decreased all cause mortality risk. And that's what we can see here. So, on the Y-axis we've got relative risk for all cause mortality. And this is in people with total cholesterol less than 160, and varying levels of albumin, A L B, and HDL cholesterol, HDL C.

What about when albumin is relatively high, as shown there? And now we have a significant effect. And I've defined this as the close to youthful phenotype because relatively low total cholesterol and relatively higher albumin are found in youth. So, again, this is a 79-year-old.

So, when compared with the reference, which was defined as 220 to 229 for total cholesterol. And when putting my data into perspective, we can see that a total cholesterol of 133 milligrams per deciliter is associated with more than a twofold increased all cause mortality risk. And superficially, this is bad news.

So, let's take a look at the aging data for a little bit more perspective. And note that low total cholesterol is found in youth, but also in older ages, which is what we can see here. So, this is the larger study based on the study on the left. And this includes total cholesterol on the Y-axis, plotted against age of entry on the X. So, this age range goes from 18 to 88 years. So, what we can see for both men and women is that low total cholesterol is found in youth, somewhere in the 160 to 170 range, depending on if you're a man or a woman. And then total cholesterol peaks somewhere around 50 for both men and women. And after which we can see then an age-related decline, such that if we extrapolate further to about 100 years old or older, and I covered this in an earlier video, and if you missed that, it'll be in the right corner. We can see that relatively low total cholesterol can also be found in advanced age, including centenarians.

So, how can we know if low total cholesterol is reflective of youth or aging and increased all cause mortality risk? So, low total cholesterol within the context of other youthful biomarkers is associated with a decreased all cause mortality risk. And that's what we can see here. So, on the Y-axis we've got relative risk for all cause mortality. And this is in people with total cholesterol less than 160, and varying levels of albumin, A L B, and HDL cholesterol, HDL C. And note that this data is in a very small study, it only included 393 people. So, this may not be what actually ends up being the truth for people who have a relatively low total cholesterol. We'll need more studies in this area. But note this study was published in 2001, and I haven't come across any other studies, including the study on the left, that adjusted their data for things like albumin, for example. So, this is a 79-year-old, and let's get into the data.

So, when compared with the hazard ratio of one, when the brackets or 95% confidence interval is completely below one, as indicated by the green arrow there, we have a significant effect, statistically significant effect. In contrast, when the 95% confidence interval overlaps with one, as shown there, that effect is not statistically significant.

So, let's start off by defining the aged phenotype. And in this case, the reference actually ended up being having higher all cause mortality risk. So, in that case, this was people that had a total cholesterol less than 160 and relatively low albumin and HDL cholesterol, less than 38 for albumin and less than 47 for HDL. And the reason that's the aged phenotype is because I showed in the earlier slide that relatively low total cholesterol can be found in advanced age. So, we've got total cholesterol less than 160. And then albumin and HDL decline during aging. So, we see relatively lower albumin and HDL in people with advanced age. So, combined, low total cholesterol, low albumin, low HDL. That's the aged phenotype. What about when HDL is relatively higher within that context? And then as I mentioned, we can see that the 95% confidence interval overlaps with one. So, this is not significantly different from the reference. So, we can conclude that higher HDL, relatively higher HDL, doesn't impact all cause mortality risk when we have relatively low total cholesterol and low albumin.
