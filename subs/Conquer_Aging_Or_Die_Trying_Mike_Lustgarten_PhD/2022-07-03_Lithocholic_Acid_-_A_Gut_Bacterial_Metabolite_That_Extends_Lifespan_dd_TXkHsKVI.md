# 2022-07-03 Lithocholic Acid - A Gut Bacterial Metabolite That Extends Lifespan

## Executive Summary

*   In a mouse model of longevity (Little (dwarf) mice with reduced growth hormone), circulating bile acids are elevated. Total bile acids are 4.2-fold higher than in wild-type mice, with 6 out of 7 individual bile acids significantly increased (2.8 to 5.4-fold).
*   Cholic acid supplementation (0.1% in diet) extends median lifespan by 7% and shows a borderline increase in maximum lifespan in a mouse model of accelerated aging (ZMPSTE24 knockout mice).
*   Lithocholic acid (LCA), a bile acid exclusively produced by gut bacteria, significantly extends lifespan in yeast (2.5-fold median lifespan increase under caloric restriction) and in male Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies), increasing both median and maximum lifespan.
*   Human studies show that fecal LCA levels are significantly higher in centenarians compared to younger age groups and their offspring, suggesting a potential role for gut bacteria in human longevity.
*   Both endurance and resistance exercise significantly increase blood LCA levels. After one hour of either exercise type, LCA levels tripled within 60 minutes and remained elevated (doubled or tripled) up to three hours post-exercise.

## Mouse Data: Bile Acids and Lifespan

Circulating levels of bile acids are elevated in a mouse model of longevity known as Little (dwarf) mice. These mice have a mutation in the growth hormone receptor, leading to 99% reduced levels of circulating growth hormone.
Survival data for Little (dwarf) mice shows a significant increase in both median and maximum lifespan compared to control animals. Median survival is defined as the point where 50% of the colony has died, while maximum survival is when 90% of the colony has died.

When examining specific bile acids in the blood of Little (dwarf) mice:
*   Seven different bile acids were measured.
*   Six of these, with the exception of alpha-muricholic acid, were significantly higher in Little (dwarf) mice compared to wild-type mice.
*   The increases ranged from 2.8-fold to 5.4-fold.
*   Total levels of these bile acids were 4.2-fold elevated in Little (dwarf) mice compared to wild-type.

This suggests that circulating bile acids are associated with an increased lifespan, even though the primary intervention in this model was a mutation in the growth hormone receptor.

## Causation: Cholic Acid Extends Mouse Lifespan

One of the primary bile acids, cholic acid, was previously found to be significantly higher (3.5-fold) in dwarf mice compared to wild-type. Research indicates that cholic acid on its own can extend lifespan in a mouse model of accelerated aging.

A study using ZMPSTE24 knockout mice, a model for progeria (accelerated aging), investigated the effects of cholic acid supplementation on lifespan.

**Study Protocol:**
*   **Subjects:** ZMPSTE24 knockout mice (accelerated aging model).
*   **Groups:**
    *   Control-fed mice.
    *   Cholic acid-fed mice (0.1% cholic acid supplied in the diet).
*   **Outcome Measures:** Median survival (50% survival) and maximum survival (20% survival, meaning 80% of the colony had died).

**Results:**
*   Cholic acid supplementation led to a significant increase in median lifespan by 7%.
*   A borderline significant increase in maximum lifespan was observed (p-value = 0.054).

## Lithocholic Acid (LCA) and Lifespan Extension

Lithocholic acid (LCA) was another bile acid that was found to be significantly higher (3.7-fold) in Little (dwarf) mice compared to wild-type. Further investigation into LCA's effects on longevity has been conducted in other models.

### LCA in Yeast

LCA has been shown to extend lifespan in yeast.

**Initial Yeast Study Protocol (Caloric Restriction):**
*   **Subjects:** Yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).
*   **Conditions:**
    *   Yeast grown in cell culture.
    *   Wild-type yeast (not supplied with bile acids).
    *   Yeast supplemented with lithocholic acid (LCA).
    *   All yeast grown under caloric restricted conditions (0.2% glucose).
*   **Outcome Measure:** Median survival (50% of yeast cells alive).

**Results (Caloric Restriction):**
*   Median survival for wild-type, non-bile acid-supplemented yeast was 12 days.
*   LCA supplementation dramatically extended median lifespan to 30 days, representing a 2.5-fold increase in median lifespan.

### LCA in Yeast without Caloric Restriction

A follow-up study investigated if LCA extends yeast lifespan even without caloric restriction.

**Yeast Study Protocol (Varying Glucose Concentrations):**
*   **Subjects:** Yeast cells.
*   **Conditions:**
    *   Measured average and maximum lifespan.
    *   Yeast exposed to various glucose concentrations: 0%, 0.2% (caloric restricted), and 2% (non-caloric restricted).
    *   Compared non-supplemented yeast to LCA-supplemented yeast.

**Results (Non-Caloric Restriction):**
*   Under caloric restricted conditions (0.2% glucose), LCA increased both average and maximum lifespan.
*   Even under non-caloric restricted conditions (2% glucose, 10-fold higher than 0.2%), LCA-supplemented yeast still exhibited significant increases for both average and maximum lifespan.

This demonstrates that LCA extends lifespan in yeast under both caloric restricted and non-caloric restricted conditions.

### LCA in Flies

LCA also extends lifespan in other animal models, such as flies.

**Fly Study Protocol:**
*   **Subjects:** Male W1118 flies (Drosophila melanogaster).
*   **Groups:** Control flies vs. LCA-supplemented flies.
*   **Outcome Measures:** Median lifespan (50% survival) and maximum lifespan (10% survival).

**Results:**
*   Flies supplemented with LCA showed significant increases in both median lifespan and maximum lifespan compared to controls.
    *   (Note: No data on LCA supplementation and lifespan in female flies was reported.)

### LCA in Mice (Current Data Gap)

Currently, there is no available data on whether LCA supplementation extends lifespan in mice.

## Human Evidence: LCA and Longevity

Human studies suggest a role for LCA in longevity. Fecal levels of LCA are higher in centenarians (people who have lived to be older than 100 years) compared to younger age groups.

**Human Fecal LCA Study 1:**
*   **Subjects:**
    *   Centenarians (160 people, average age 107 years).
    *   Older adults (112 people, average age 86 years).
    *   Young adults (41 people, average age 31 years).
    *   Lineal descendants of centenarians (CEL, 22 people, average age 75 years).
*   **Outcome Measure:** Fecal LCA levels (micromoles of LCA per gram of feces).

**Results:**
*   Centenarians had significantly higher levels of fecal LCA compared to all other groups (older adults, young adults, and their offspring/lineal descendants).

This finding suggests that relatively higher fecal levels of LCA correlate with increased human longevity and points to a potential role for gut bacteria in this association.

### Gut Bacteria and LCA Production Pathway

LCA is exclusively produced by gut bacteria. The pathway begins with cholesterol in the liver:
*   Cholesterol is degraded through a series of enzymatic steps to produce the primary bile acid, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA).
*   CDCA is then conjugated with either taurine or glycine to form tauro-CDCA or glyco-CDCA.
*   These conjugated metabolites are released by the gallbladder into the intestine after a meal.
*   Within the intestine, gut bacteria convert these conjugated bile acids into secondary bile acids such as ursodeoxycholate (UDCA) or lithocholic acid (LCA).

Thus, the presence and levels of LCA are directly linked to gut bacterial activity.

### Replication of Human Fecal LCA Findings

Another human study replicated the finding of higher LCA levels in centenarians.

**Human Fecal LCA Study 2:**
*   **Subjects:**
    *   Centenarians (or close to centenarians: 94-105 years old, with an average age of 97 years).
    *   Their offspring (50-79 years old, with an average age of 67 years).
*   **Outcome Measure:** Fecal LCA levels.

**Results:**
*   The centenarian group had a 43% higher level of LCA in feces compared to their offspring.
*   This difference was statistically significant (p-value and false discovery rate < 0.05).

## Increasing LCA Levels: The Role of Exercise

Given the association of LCA with longevity, the question arises whether LCA levels can be increased, and if so, how. Exercise appears to be one way to achieve this.

A study investigated the effect of different types of exercise on blood LCA levels.

**Study Population:**
*   10 young, lean, fit men (average age 24, BMI 23.7, body fat percentage 12.7%, VO2 peak 55.7).
    *   (Note: This was a small study and only included men.)

### Endurance Exercise Protocol

*   **Warm-up:** 10 minutes on a bike.
*   **Main Exercise:** 50 minutes of biking at 70% of VO2 peak.
*   **Total Exercise Duration:** 1 hour.

**Results (Endurance Exercise):**
*   **Before Exercise:** Blood LCA levels were 0.01 micromolar.
*   **60 minutes After Exercise:** LCA levels tripled to 0.03 micromolar.
*   **180 minutes (3 hours) After Exercise:** LCA levels remained elevated at 0.02 micromolar (double the baseline).

### Resistance Exercise Protocol

*   **Warm-up:** 5 minutes on a bike.
*   **Initial Sets:** 15 repetitions each for 4 exercises (squats, push-ups, sit-ups, back raises).
*   **Main Training:** 5 sets of 10 repetitions each for 5 exercises (knee extension, bench press, hamstring curls, lat pull-downs, leg press).
*   **Total Exercise Duration:** Approximately 1 hour.

**Results (Resistance Exercise):**
*   **Before Exercise:** Blood LCA levels were 0.01 micromolar.
*   **60 minutes After Exercise:** LCA levels tripled to 0.03 micromolar.
*   **180 minutes (3 hours) After Exercise:** LCA levels remained tripled at 0.03 micromolar.

Both endurance and resistance exercise training protocols led to a significant and sustained increase in blood LCA levels for up to three hours post-exercise. This raises the question of whether LCA levels are generally higher in athletes compared to sedentary individuals, which could potentially contribute to observed longevity benefits associated with exercise in animal models.
