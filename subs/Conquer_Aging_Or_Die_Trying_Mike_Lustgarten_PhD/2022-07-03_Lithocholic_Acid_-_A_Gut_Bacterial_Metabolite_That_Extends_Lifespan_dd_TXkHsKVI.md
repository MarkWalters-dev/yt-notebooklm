# 2022-07-03 Lithocholic Acid - A Gut Bacterial Metabolite That Extends Lifespan

## Executive Summary

*   Circulating levels of bile acids are elevated in Little (dwarf) mice, a mouse model of longevity, with most bile acids showing a 2.8 to 5.4-fold increase and total bile acids increasing 4.2-fold.
*   Cholic acid, a primary bile acid, is 3.5-fold higher in Little (dwarf) mice and extends lifespan in a mouse model of accelerated aging.
*   Lithocholic acid (LCA), a gut bacterial metabolite, extends lifespan in yeast under both calorie-restricted and non-calorie-restricted conditions, and also in *Drosophila* (fruit flies).
*   Fecal levels of LCA are significantly higher (by 43%) in centenarians (average age 97 years) compared to younger offspring (average age 67 years), suggesting a role for gut bacteria in human longevity.
*   Blood levels of LCA are increased by 2-3 times after both endurance and resistance exercise, suggesting exercise as a way to modulate LCA levels.

## Mouse Data: Bile Acids and Longevity

Circulating levels of bile acids are elevated in a mouse model of longevity, specifically in Little (dwarf) mice. These mice have a mutation in the growth hormone receptor, leading to a 99% reduction in circulating growth hormone and a significant increase in both median and maximal lifespan.

In Little (dwarf) mice, all measured bile acids, except for alpha-muricholic acid, are significantly higher than in wild-type mice, ranging from 2.8-fold to 5.4-fold increases. Total bile acid levels are 4.2-fold elevated. This suggests that higher circulating bile acid levels are associated with increased lifespan in this mouse model.

## Cholic Acid and Lifespan Extension

One of the primary bile acids, cholic acid, is 3.5-fold higher in Little (dwarf) mice compared to wild-type. Cholic acid on its own has been shown to extend lifespan in a mouse model of accelerated aging (ZMPSTE24 knockout mice, a model of progeria).

### Cholic Acid Supplementation Protocol in Mice

ZMPSTE24 knockout mice were divided into two groups: control-fed and cholic acid-fed.
*   **Intervention:** 0.1% cholic acid (CA) was supplied in the diet.
*   **Results:**
    *   Median survival (50% of the colony still alive) increased by 7%.
    *   Maximum survival (20% of the colony still alive) showed a borderline significant increase (P=0.054).

## Lithocholic Acid (LCA) and Lifespan Extension

Another bile acid, lithocholic acid (LCA), is 3.7-fold higher in Little (dwarf) mice compared to wild-type.

### LCA Extends Lifespan in Yeast

LCA has been shown to extend lifespan in yeast.
*   **Yeast Strain:** Wild-type yeast.
*   **Baseline:** Median survival for wild-type yeast not supplemented with bile acids was 12 days.
*   **LCA Supplementation:** When yeast were supplemented with LCA, median lifespan dramatically increased up to 30 days, representing a 2.5-fold increase. This was observed when yeast cells were grown under calorie-restricted conditions (0.2% glucose).

### LCA Extends Yeast Lifespan in Both Calorie-Restricted and Non-Calorie-Restricted Conditions

LCA extends lifespan in yeast even without calorie restriction.
*   **Study Design:** Yeast lifespan was measured for both average and maximum lifespan under varying glucose concentrations.
    *   **Calorie-Restricted (CR) Condition:** 0.2% glucose.
    *   **Non-Calorie-Restricted (NCR) Condition:** 2% glucose (10-fold higher than CR).
*   **Results:**
    *   Under 0.2% glucose (CR), LCA supplementation led to a significant increase in both average and maximum lifespan.
    *   Under 2% glucose (NCR), LCA supplementation still resulted in significant increases for both average and maximum lifespan.

### LCA Extends Lifespan in *Drosophila* (Flies)

LCA also extends lifespan in *Drosophila*.
*   **Fly Strain:** Male W-1118 flies.
*   **Results:** Significant increases in both median and maximum lifespan were observed in flies supplemented with LCA.

*Note: Data for LCA supplementation on lifespan in female flies or in mice is not available in this study.*

## Human Evidence: LCA and Longevity

Fecal levels of LCA are higher in centenarians (people who have lived for more than 100 years) compared to younger age groups, suggesting a connection between LCA and human longevity.

### Study 1: Centenarians vs. Younger Age Groups

*   **Study Population:**
    *   **Centenarians:** 160 individuals, average age 107 years.
    *   **Older Group:** Average age 86 years (112 subjects).
    *   **Young Group:** Average age 31 years (41 subjects).
    *   **Centenarian Offspring (CEL):** Average age 75 years (22 subjects).
*   **Measurement:** Fecal LCA levels (micromoles per gram of feces).
*   **Results:** Centenarians had significantly higher fecal LCA levels compared to all other groups (older, younger, and centenarian offspring).

### Study 2: Centenarians vs. Offspring

*   **Study Population:**
    *   **Centenarians (or close to centenarians):** Average age 97 years (range 94-105 years).
    *   **Offspring:** Average age 67 years (range 50-79 years).
*   **Measurement:** Fecal LCA levels.
*   **Results:** Centenarians had a 43% higher level of LCA in feces compared to their offspring. This difference was statistically significant (P-value and False Discovery Rate < 0.05).

## The Role of Gut Bacteria in LCA Production

Higher fecal LCA levels suggest a role for gut bacteria in longevity. LCA is exclusively produced by gut bacteria.
*   **Cholesterol Metabolism:** Cholesterol in the liver is degraded into primary bile acids, such as chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA).
*   **Conjugation:** CDCA is conjugated with taurine or glycine to form tauro-CDCA or glyco-CDCA.
*   **Intestinal Release:** These conjugated metabolites are released into the intestine after a meal.
*   **Gut Bacterial Conversion:** Gut bacteria convert these into secondary bile acids, including ursodeoxycholate (UDCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA).

## Exercise and LCA Levels

Exercise may be a way to increase LCA levels in the body, as blood levels of LCA are increased after exercise.

### Study Population

*   **Participants:** 10 young men (average age 24 years), lean (BMI 23.7, body fat 12.7%), and fit (VO2 peak 55.7).

### Endurance Exercise Protocol

*   **Warm-up:** 10 minutes on a bike.
*   **Main Exercise:** 50 minutes of biking at 70% of VO2 peak.
*   **Total Duration:** 1 hour of exercise.
*   **Results on Blood LCA:**
    *   **Before Exercise:** 0.01 micromolar.
    *   **60 minutes After Exercise:** Tripled to 0.03 micromolar.
    *   **3 hours After Exercise:** Doubled to 0.02 micromolar (still elevated compared to baseline).

### Resistance Exercise (Strength Training) Protocol

*   **Warm-up:** 5 minutes on a bike, followed by 15 reps each of:
    *   Squats
    *   Push-ups
    *   Sit-ups
    *   Back raises
*   **Main Exercise (5 sets of 10 reps each):**
    *   Knee extension
    *   Bench press
    *   Hamstring curls
    *   Lat pulldowns
    *   Leg press
*   **Results on Blood LCA:**
    *   **Before Exercise:** 0.01 micromolar.
    *   **60 minutes After Exercise:** Tripled.
    *   **3 hours After Exercise:** Tripled.

Both endurance and resistance exercise significantly increase blood LCA levels for up to 3 hours post-exercise.

*Note: Data on whether athletes generally have higher blood LCA levels compared to sedentary individuals is not available in this study.*
