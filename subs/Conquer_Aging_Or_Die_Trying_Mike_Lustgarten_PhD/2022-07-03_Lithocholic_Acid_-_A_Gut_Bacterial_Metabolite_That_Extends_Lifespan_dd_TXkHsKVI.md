# 2022-07-03 Lithocholic Acid - A Gut Bacterial Metabolite That Extends Lifespan

## Executive Summary

*   Circulating levels of bile acids are significantly elevated in Little (dwarf) mice, a mouse model of longevity characterized by a mutation in the growth hormone receptor.
*   One such bile acid, lithocholic acid (LCA), is exclusively produced by gut bacteria and has been shown to extend lifespan in yeast and fruit flies, even under non-calorie-restricted conditions.
*   Human studies consistently indicate that fecal lithocholic acid levels are higher in centenarians compared to younger age groups and their offspring.
*   Exercise (both endurance and resistance training) significantly increases blood levels of lithocholic acid, suggesting a potential pathway to increase this longevity-associated metabolite.

## Elevated Bile Acids in Long-Lived Mice

Circulating levels of bile acids are elevated in a mouse model of longevity. This model consists of Little (dwarf) mice, which have a mutation in the growth hormone receptor, leading to 99% reduced levels of circulating growth hormone.

In this model, there is a significant increase in both median and maximal lifespan compared to control animals. Median survival is defined as when half the colony has died, and maximal survival is when 90% of the colony has died.

When examining circulating bile acids in these Little (dwarf) mice:
*   Seven bile acids were analyzed in blood from Little (dwarf) mice and wild-type mice.
*   For all bile acids except alpha-muricholic acid, levels were significantly higher in Little (dwarf) mice compared to wild-type mice.
*   These increases ranged from 2.8-fold to 5.4-fold higher.
*   Total levels of these bile acids were 4.2-fold elevated in Little (dwarf) mice compared to wild-type mice.

This data suggests that elevated circulating bile acids are associated with an increased lifespan in this mouse model of longevity.

## Cholic Acid Extends Lifespan in an Accelerated Aging Mouse Model

One specific bile acid, cholic acid, was observed to be 3.5-fold higher in Little (dwarf) mice compared to wild-type. Research shows that cholic acid on its own can extend lifespan in a mouse model of accelerated aging.

A study utilized ZMPSTE24 knockout mice, which serve as an accelerated aging model (a genetic model of progeria). These mice were divided into two feeding groups: control-fed and cholic acid-fed.

**Cholic Acid Supplementation Protocol:**
*   0.1% cholic acid was supplied in the diet.

**Results on Lifespan Extension:**
*   A significant increase of 7% was observed for median lifespan (50% survival).
*   A borderline significant increase was noted for maximum lifespan (defined as 20% survival), with a P-value of 0.054.

## Lithocholic Acid Extends Lifespan in Yeast

Lithocholic acid (LCA), another bile acid, was found to be 3.7-fold higher in the long-lived Little (dwarf) mice. Studies on yeast demonstrate that LCA can extend lifespan.

### Yeast Study 1: Calorie-Restricted Conditions

*   **Experimental Setup:** Yeast cells were grown in cell culture. Lifespan was measured by the percentage of alive yeast cells over days in culture. Wild-type yeast not supplied with bile acids served as the control.
*   **Control Lifespan:** Median survival for wild-type yeast was 12 days.
*   **LCA Supplementation:** Yeast supplemented with lithocholic acid showed a dramatic increase in median lifespan, extending up to 30 days. This represents a 2.5-fold increase in median lifespan.
*   **Conditions:** This experiment was conducted when yeast cells were grown under 0.2% glucose, which are calorie-restricted conditions.

### Yeast Study 2: Calorie-Restricted and Non-Calorie-Restricted Conditions

This study aimed to determine if lithocholic acid extends yeast lifespan independently of calorie restriction.
*   **Lifespan Measurements:** Both average lifespan and maximum lifespan were analyzed.
*   **Glucose Concentrations:** Yeast were exposed to varying glucose concentrations: 0% (no glucose), 0.2% (calorie-restricted), and 2% (non-calorie-restricted, 10 times higher than 0.2%).
*   **LCA Treatment:** Yeast were either not supplemented with LCA or were supplemented with LCA.
*   **Results at 0.2% Glucose:** An increase in both average and maximum lifespan was observed in LCA-supplemented yeast, confirming previous findings under calorie restriction.
*   **Results at 2% Glucose:** Even under non-calorie-restricted conditions (2% glucose), LCA-supplemented yeast still exhibited significant increases in both average and maximum lifespan.

**Conclusion:** Lithocholic acid extends lifespan in yeast under both calorie-restricted and non-calorie-restricted conditions.

## Lithocholic Acid Extends Lifespan in Flies

Lithocholic acid also extends lifespan in *Drosophila melanogaster* (flies).

*   **Study Population:** Male W1118 flies were used.
*   **Lifespan Measurements:** Survival was plotted against age to determine median and maximum lifespan. Median lifespan was defined as 50% survival, and maximum lifespan as 10% survival.
*   **Results:** Significant increases in both median lifespan and maximum lifespan were observed in flies that were supplemented with lithocholic acid compared to control flies.

## Human Evidence: Higher Fecal Lithocholic Acid in Centenarians

Fecal levels of lithocholic acid are higher in centenarians (people who have lived to be older than 100 years) compared to younger age groups. This suggests a potential link between LCA and human longevity.

### Study 1: Comparison Across Age Groups

*   **Measurements:** Lithocholic acid (LCA) levels were measured in micromoles of LCA per gram of feces.
*   **Study Groups:**
    *   **Centenarians:** 160 individuals, average age 107 years.
    *   **Older:** 112 individuals, average age 86 years.
    *   **Young:** 41 individuals, average age 31 years.
    *   **CEL (Centenarian Offspring):** 22 individuals, lineal descendants of centenarians, average age 75 years.
*   **Results:** Centenarians had significantly higher levels of lithocholic acid in their feces compared to all other groups (older, young, and their centenarian offspring).

### Role of Gut Bacteria in LCA Production

The elevated fecal levels of lithocholic acid in centenarians suggest a crucial role for gut bacteria in longevity. Lithocholic acid is exclusively produced by gut bacteria through the following pathway:
*   Cholesterol, synthesized in the liver, is degraded through enzymatic steps to produce the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA).
*   CDCA is then conjugated with either taurine or glycine to form tauro-CDCA or glyco-CDCA.
*   These conjugated metabolites are released by the gallbladder into the intestine after a meal.
*   Within the intestine, gut bacteria convert these conjugated bile acids into either ursodeoxycholate (UDCA) or lithocholic acid (LCA).

### Study 2: Replication of Findings

Another study further supported the finding of higher LCA levels in older age groups.
*   **Study Groups:**
    *   **Centenarians/Close to Centenarians:** Individuals aged 94-105 years (average age 97 years).
    *   **Offspring:** Their children, aged 50-79 years (average age 67 years).
*   **Results:** The centenarian/close-to-centenarian group had a 43% higher level of lithocholic acid in their feces compared to their offspring. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05 and False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 0.05).

## Exercise Increases Lithocholic Acid Levels

Given the association of lithocholic acid with longevity, a key question is how its levels can be increased. Exercise has been identified as a method to significantly increase blood levels of lithocholic acid.

A study involving 10 young men (average age 24 years, lean with a BMI of 23.7 and body fat of 12.7%, and highly fit with a VO2 peak of 55.7) investigated the effect of different exercise types on LCA levels.

### Endurance Exercise Protocol

*   **Warm-up:** 10 minutes on a bike.
*   **Main Exercise:** 50 minutes of biking at 70% of their VO2 peak (a relatively strenuous effort).
*   **Total Duration:** 1 hour of endurance exercise.

**Effect on Blood Lithocholic Acid Levels:**
*   **Before Exercise:** 0.01 micromolar.
*   **60 minutes After Exercise:** Levels tripled to 0.03 micromolar.
*   **3 hours After Exercise:** Levels remained elevated at 0.02 micromolar (double the pre-exercise level).
*   **Conclusion:** Blood lithocholic acid levels are increased for up to 3 hours following endurance exercise.

### Resistance Exercise Protocol (Strength Training)

*   **Warm-up:**
    *   5 minutes on a bike.
    *   15 repetitions each for squats, push-ups, sit-ups, and back raises.
*   **Strength Training:** 5 sets of 10 repetitions each for:
    *   Knee extension
    *   Bench press
    *   Hamstring curls
    *   Lat pull-downs
    *   Leg press

**Effect on Blood Lithocholic Acid Levels:**
*   **Before Exercise:** 0.01 micromolar.
*   **60 minutes After Exercise:** Levels tripled.
*   **180 minutes (3 hours) After Exercise:** Levels remained tripled.
*   **Conclusion:** Blood lithocholic acid levels were tripled after resistance exercise training.
