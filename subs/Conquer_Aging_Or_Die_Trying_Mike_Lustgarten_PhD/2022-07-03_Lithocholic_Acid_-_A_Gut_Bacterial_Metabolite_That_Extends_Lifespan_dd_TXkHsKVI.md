# 2022-07-03 Lithocholic Acid - A Gut Bacterial Metabolite That Extends Lifespan

Circulating levels of bile acids are elevated in a mouse model of longevity. Survival data for control animals and Little (dwarf) mice show a significant increase for both median and maximal lifespan in the Little (dwarf) mice, which are otherwise known as dwarf mice. These animals have a mutation in the growth hormone receptor, leading to 99% reduced levels of circulating growth hormone.

Circulating levels of seven bile acids were measured in blood for Little (dwarf) mice and wild-type mice. For all of these bile acids, with the exception of alpha-muricholic acid, levels are significantly higher in the dwarf mice when compared with the wild-type mice, ranging from 2.8-fold to 5.44-fold higher. Total levels of these bile acids are 4.2-fold elevated in the dwarf mice compared to the wild-type. From this, it can be concluded that circulating bile acids are associated with an increased lifespan.

## Cholic Acid and Accelerated Aging
One bile acid, cholic acid, was significantly higher in the dwarf mice (3.5-fold higher) compared to wild-type. Cholic acid on its own extends lifespan in a mouse model of accelerated aging.

In a study using Zmpste24 knockout mice, an accelerated aging model (a mouse model of progeria), mice were split into control-fed and cholic acid (CA)-fed groups, with 0.1% cholic acid supplied in the diet.
*   Median survival (50% survival) increased by 7% in cholic acid-fed mice.
*   Maximum survival (20% survival, meaning 80% of the colony died) showed a borderline significant increase (p = 0.054) in cholic acid-fed mice.

## Lithocholic Acid in Yeast
Lithocholic acid (LCA) extends lifespan in yeast. Median survival for wild-type non-bile acid supplemented yeast was 12 days. When yeast were supplemented with lithocholic acid, there was a dramatic increase in median lifespan up to 30 days, a 2.5-fold increase. This was observed when yeast cells were grown under 0.2% glucose, which represents calorie-restricted conditions.

Lithocholic acid extends lifespan in yeast under both calorie-restricted and non-calorie-restricted conditions.
In the study, yeast were exposed to glucose concentrations ranging from 0.2% (calorie-restricted) up to 2% (non-calorie-restricted, 10-fold higher glucose).
*   At 0.2% glucose, lithocholic acid supplementation led to increases in both average and maximum lifespan.
*   Even under non-calorie-restricted conditions (2% glucose), lithocholic acid supplemented yeast still had significant increases for both average and maximum lifespan.

## Lithocholic Acid in Flies
Lithocholic acid also extends lifespan in flies. In a study with male W1118 flies, significant increases were observed in flies supplemented with lithocholic acid for both median lifespan (50% survival) and maximum lifespan (10% survival).

## Lithocholic Acid in Humans
Fecal levels of lithocholic acid are higher in centenarians (people who have lived to over 100 years) compared with younger age groups.
In one study, centenarians (average age 107 years, n=160) had significantly higher levels of lithocholic acid (micromoles per gram of feces) compared to three younger groups:
*   Older (average age 86 years, n=112)
*   Young (average age 31 years, n=41)
*   Centenarian offspring (average age 75 years, n=22)

Another study confirmed this finding. The two groups were centenarians or close to centenarians (average age 97 years, range 94-105 years) and their offspring (average age 67 years, range 50-79 years). Centenarians or close to centenarians had a 43% higher level of lithocholic acid in feces compared with their offspring. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05 and FDR < 0.05).

## Role of Gut Bacteria
Relatively higher fecal levels of lithocholic acid suggest a role for gut bacteria in longevity. The process is as follows:
1.  Cholesterol in the liver is degraded to produce the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA).
2.  CDCA is then conjugated with either taurine or glycine to form tauro-CDCA or glyco-CDCA.
3.  These conjugated metabolites are released by the gallbladder after a meal into the intestine.
4.  Gut bacteria convert these into either ursodeoxycholate (UDCA) or lithocholic acid (LCA).

Lithocholic acid is exclusively produced by gut bacteria.

## Exercise and Lithocholic Acid Levels
Exercise may be one way to increase lithocholic acid levels, as blood levels of lithocholic acid are increased after exercise. This effect was observed after either one hour of endurance exercise or one hour of of resistance exercise (strength training).

The study involved young, lean men (24 years old, BMI 23.7, body fat 12.7%, VO2 peak 55.7).

### Endurance Training Protocol
*   10-minute warm-up on the bike.
*   50 minutes of biking at 70% of VO2 peak.
*   Total endurance exercise: 1 hour.

**Effect on Blood Lithocholic Acid Levels:**
*   Before exercise: 0.01 micromolar.
*   60 minutes after exercise: Tripled to 0.03 micromolar.
*   3 hours after exercise: Remained elevated at 0.02 micromolar (doubled compared to before exercise).
Lithocholic acid levels increased up to 3 hours after endurance exercise.

### Resistance Training Protocol
*   5-minute warm-up on the bike.
*   15 reps each for:
    *   Squats
    *   Push-ups
    *   Sit-ups
    *   Back raises
*   5 sets of 10 reps each for:
    *   Knee extension
    *   Bench press
    *   Hamstring curls
    *   Lat pull-downs
    *   Leg press

**Effect on Blood Lithocholic Acid Levels:**
*   Before exercise: 0.01 micromolar.
*   60 minutes after exercise: Tripled.
*   3 hours (180 minutes) after exercise: Tripled.
Blood lithocholic acid levels were tripled after this resistance exercise training protocol.

This raises the question of whether lithocholic acid levels in blood are higher in athletes compared to sedentary subjects. If so, this could potentially contribute to the increased average lifespan observed in animal models following exercise training compared to sedentary animals.
