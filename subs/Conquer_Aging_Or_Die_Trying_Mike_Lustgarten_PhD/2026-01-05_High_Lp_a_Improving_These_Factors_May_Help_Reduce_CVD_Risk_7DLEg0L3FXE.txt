even if someone's got relatively high lipoprotein A, 75, 80 uh nanomolar or more, having HCRP less than 2 milligrams per liter, not 0.2, that uh essentially the uh CVD mortality risk goes away. So, but if you've got high HCRP, the risk increases based on CVD risk based on lipoprotein A, and then also the waist to hip ratio. So, when waist to hip ratio is less than 0.93, it's not associated with an increased risk of lipoprotein A associated CVD outcomes. But for people who had a waste to hip ratio greater than one, and I've got a video coming out on actually I released it today. Uh it's on YouTube today. But um but so for people who have a waist to hip ratio greater than one, lipoprotein A higher than 50 milligrams per deciliter, which would be 125 nanomolar, way off the charts compared to the three of you guys, that's associated with an increased CVD mortality uh outcome risk, whereas people with lipoprotein A less than 50 milligrams per deciliter and 125 nanomolar with a waste to hip ratio less than 0.93, no association with CVD mortality related outcomes. So, there may be for people who have hot relatively high lipoprotein A ways to modulate that risk by keeping inflammation low and waste to hip ratio low.
