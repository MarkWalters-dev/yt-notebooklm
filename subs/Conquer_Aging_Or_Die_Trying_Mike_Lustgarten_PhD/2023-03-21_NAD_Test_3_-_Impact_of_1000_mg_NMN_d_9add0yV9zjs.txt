What's my intracellular level of NAD? To sort that out, on January 23rd of 2023, I sent blood for analysis to Jinfiniti Precision Medicine, and we saw that my NAD level was 25.6 micromolar, which then raises the question, is that value youthful or aged? So when using Jinfiniti's data for how NAD levels change during aging, we saw that it was in the aged category. So with that in mind, I supplemented with 300 milligrams per day of NMN for the next 21 days as soon as getting as soon as I got the data after test number one, retesting on February 21st of 2023. And if you're interested in why I used NMN instead of niacin, I covered that in an earlier video, which will be in the right corner. So then using 300 milligrams per day of NMN, we saw that my intracellular level of NAD was essentially the same, 25.3 micromolar. So no effect. So I decided to further increase NMN, going with one gram per day or 1000 milligrams of NMN per day for one week, and I retested on March 5th of 2023. So what was the impact on NAD? And here we can see that I finally got an increase for my intracellular level of NAD as it went up to 39.3 micromolar. And now I would be close in the close to youthful range as values greater than 40 micromolar would be expected to be found in people younger than 30 years old. But now for the caveats. First, a higher NAD level, because I sent these data on the same day that I did a full blood panel, there was no change for blood biomarker based biological age, including Levine's test and aging.ai. In contrast to an earlier hypothesis that I pitched in a separate video where I thought that having higher NAD could potentially impact DHEA sulfate, there was no impact on DHEA sulfate as it was 129 micrograms per deciliter, which is within the range of where it usually is. But if there is a reason for hope, it's possible that higher NAD impacted my epigenetic age, as I sent blood for epigenetic analysis to True Diagnostic on the same day that I did this test. So I don't yet have that data. I expect to have it either late this month or early in April, so stay tuned for that update video coming soon. All right, that's all for now.
