Hi everyone, today's guest is Dr. Gier Schmidt Schönbein, who is a distinguished professor in the Shujing Jean Lee Department of Bioengineering at the University of California, San Diego. Today, Dr. Schönbein will present his lab's work, which focuses on the novel hypothesis that aging is impacted by autodigestion. And for those who may not be familiar, not autophagy, but the process of autodigestion. And we'll get all into it. Gier, Dr. Schönbein will get all into that into his presentation. So with that, welcome Gier.

Okay. Michael, thank you for the invitation. I'm going to talk to you today about autodigestion. In a nutshell, what that means is this, we human beings, many other species on the planet, digest themselves. And this has far-reaching implications. I have a conflict of interest, it's mild, and I need to emphasize that the people who really done this work are listed here. Wonderful collaborators, students in the and postdocs in the lab, and I'm going to highlight today especially the work of Frank Delano and Eric Kirstler.

Why digestive enzymes? Well, if you go by the literature and you look at peer-reviewed publications, um, if you look at the National Library of Medicine and under the term aging, aging in the title, you get 82,000 references. These are all peer-reviewed. If you now go ahead and you put in aging and digestive enzymes, you put both of these words in there, how many publications have come out? As of last two days ago, it's exactly one. So that may tell somebody, a young student, that this is not a good topic area to get involved in. And the question arises, so in other words, it's not a very crowded field. Um, I've been thinking about this for quite some time. And actually the starting point for our work was coming out of the field of shock. This is a community of people they working in the intensive care unit. And they are dealing with problems where an individual is hurt in an accident or to drowning, and a particular model that they like to use is called hemorrhagic shock. All you do is this, place a femoral catheter, remove some blood, and then return the blood afterwards, say after an hour. And what you observe there are many things, but the one I wanted to talk draw attention today is you will have a group of animals that survives this procedure. 24 hours later, they're just doing fine. And then you have a group that is non-survivors. And I've been very curious about this. The same procedure, the same chemical constituents, why would there be a group of individuals who fall victim to this event? And remember this is a young, teenage rat. So I'm as healthy as they will ever come.

Um, in order to gain insight into this phenomenon, we decided to do the following experiment. We took plasma of these survivors at the end of the experiment, and we exposed them to naive cells. We happen to like working with leukocytes. Here's two scanning electron micrographs of them. And so these naive cells are seeing now the plasma of a survivor. In contrast, if you take the plasma of a non-survivor, you discover that these cells go into an activated state. Just like if they were phagocytosis bacteria, uh, a high percentage of the cells go into activated state. It has severe consequences for the microcirculation, but the most important question that comes to mind, we have two plasmas and one plasma stimulates these cells. So the obvious question is, what causes and what's in this plasma that causes this type of stimulation? I spent quite a bit of time on that. And many suggestions were made. Some people believe it's bacteria, it could be bacterial products like endotoxins, complement, all kinds of ideas were brought out. We tried these. And several of these. And we always ran into the following situation. Let's say complement. Yes, we find complement components from the complement cascade, but when we make an effort to remove that complement, or block the complement receptor, we do not see that this type of stimulation disappears. And so I was quite desperate actually at this point. We decided to take a totally fresh idea. And my student Eric Kirstler had the idea, why don't we do the following? It says, and perfectly healthy animal is able to generate a set of stimulators in plasma. It must be coming from the organs. So he decided to homogenize different organs, you see them listed here, and then exposed homogenate to naive cells, just like you saw previously. Most of the organs produce, uh, something like 10% with one exception, and that's the pancreas. It's very consistently highly reproducible. Um, the intestine doesn't stimulate these cells unless you go out and you add the constituents of the blood. What we're seeing here is actually after we washed the intestine. Once you leave the intestinal content in, it would behave just like the pancreas. Um, now, if you add trypsin, this is an experiment, you could add many other proteases, you see every organ now becomes a stimulator for these cells. So every organ is now suddenly an inflammatory mediator, and it can possibly lead to death. So that was the first indication that we need to pay attention to the pancreatic enzymes.

Now, you are the experts on pancreatic digestion. So I'm going to be very brief. And want to remind you of some items that in this discussion play a role. So here is a pancreas. 95% of the pancreas is used to generate the digestive enzymes. The other 5% generate insulin. And these enzymes are released in a proform. They end up in the duodenum. In the duodenum, they'll be activated through the enterokinases that are expressed on the epithelium in this region of the intestine. And then the food, what these digestive enzymes go on this long ride through the intestine. Now, there's of course well-known today, there is a pretty comprehensive system designed to digest every biological molecule other than fibers. Our digestive enzymes can break down every protein, every carbohydrate, every lipid and all nuclei. So they are designed by nature to be as nonspecific as possible.

The other angle to this is especially important for us. If you take a sample out of the intestine, and you find out what is the digestive enzyme activity. We do this by adding a substrate that when it's activated by a digestive enzyme, it will turn into a fluorescent signal. And so we can read in fluorescent units the activity of the digestive enzymes in the lumen of the intestine. No surprise, um, there is plenty of activity in the intestine. We have units of fluorescence units, 2,700 units, somewhere between 3,000. But now comes an interesting comparison. How about if we take from the same animal, now a plasma sample, and read fluorescent units? And those numbers are order of magnitude smaller, maybe 10, maybe 15, 20, but not much beyond. So the observation that we make at this point, wait a second, there is a huge proteolytic activity in the intestine, has to be, because we're digesting. And there's very low proteolytic activity in the plasma per se.

Um, so, uh, this is a comparison that justifies to ask the question. Okay, I can eat an intestine. This is, uh, set one style. I can digest that intestine, but I don't digest myself. How has nature come up with a solution to this problem? There are basically two mechanisms that have been proposed. The dominating mechanism is that people I've identified, a set of protease inhibitors, trypsin and chymotrypsin, that are synthesized in the liver. And these are permanently in an inactive form. They're binding molecules, permanently inhibiting trypsin and chymotrypsin. We have large amounts of these in our bloodstream, in fact, probably, um, they are of the amounts just like albumin and fibrinogen. Nature had known for a while that somehow we have to have a protection against trypsin and chymotrypsin and the other serine proteases. The other mechanism is that nature has come up with an idea. Why don't we digest in the lumen of the intestine, and we then put a barrier? So that the digestive enzymes cannot get out. The barrier has to be clever, it has to allow nutrients, like individual amino acids, to get through, but not digestive enzymes. They are of the order of magnitude of 20k and larger. So as a result, we need a barrier. And this barrier is illustrated here. The blue color you see here, this is a villus, and this is in the lumen of the intestine, and this is at the base of the intestine. Um, and we labeled this particular structure with an agent that stains the mucin in blue color. So we see lots of mucin here, the entire intestine is covered by mucin. And there are specific isoforms. Um, there are two isoforms. One is an isoform that is released from the goblet cells and they get discharged into the lumen, they mix with the food. And then there's a second, even more important mucin 13 isoform that is on the top of the epithelial cell, in what some people call the brush border. That particular mucin is actually the actual barrier for digestive enzymes. Low molecular weight can get through, but not large molecular weight. This is how nature would like to see things. But if you now, um, look at the activity, this is again with a substrate that changes its fluorescent properties when you apply it on trypsin, you can read fluorescent units, the activity of the digestive enzymes in the lumen of the intestine. And those are orders of magnitude smaller, maybe 10, maybe 15, 20, but not much beyond. So the observation that we make at this point, wait a second, there is a huge proteolytic activity in the intestine, has to be, because we're digesting.

The barrier has to be clever, it has to allow nutrients, like individual amino acids, to get through, but not digestive enzymes. They are of the order of magnitude of 20k and larger. So as a result, we need a barrier. And this barrier is illustrated here. The blue color you see here, this is a villus, and this is in the lumen of the intestine, and this is at the base of the intestine. Um, and we labeled this particular structure with an agent that stains the mucin in blue color. So we see lots of mucin here, the entire intestine is covered by mucin. And there are specific isoforms. Um, there are two isoforms. One is an isoform that is released from the goblet cells and they get discharged into the lumen, they mix with the food. And then there's a second, even more important mucin 13 isoform that is on the top of the epithelial cell, in what some people call the brush border. That particular mucin is actually the actual barrier for digestive enzymes. Low molecular weight can get through, but not large molecular weight. This is how nature would like to see things. But if you now, um, look at the activity, this is again with a substrate that changes its fluorescent properties when you apply it on trypsin, you can read fluorescent units, the activity of the digestive enzymes in the lumen of the intestine. And those are orders of magnitude smaller, maybe 10, maybe 15, 20, but not much beyond. So the observation that we make at this point, wait a second, there is a huge proteolytic activity in the intestine, has to be, because we're digesting. And there's very low proteolytic activity in the plasma per se.

Um, so, uh, this comparison justifies to ask the question, okay, I can eat an intestine. This is, uh, set one style. I can digest that intestine, but I don't digest myself. How has nature come up with a solution to this problem? There are basically two mechanisms that have been proposed. The dominating mechanism is that people I've identified, a set of protease inhibitors, trypsin and chymotrypsin, that are synthesized in the liver. And these are permanently in an inactive form. They're binding molecules, permanently inhibiting trypsin and chymotrypsin. We have large amounts of these in our bloodstream, in fact, probably, um, they are of the amounts just like albumin and fibrinogen.

Why don't we digest in the lumen of the intestine, and we then put a barrier? So that the digestive enzymes cannot get out. The barrier has to be clever, it has to allow nutrients, like individual amino acids, to get through, but not digestive enzymes. They are of the order of magnitude of 20k and larger. So as a result, we need a barrier. And this barrier is illustrated here. The blue color you see here, this is a villus, and this is in the lumen of the intestine, and this is at the base of the intestine. Um, and we labeled this particular structure with an agent that stains the mucin in blue color. So we see lots of mucin here, the entire intestine is covered by mucin. And there are specific isoforms. Um, there are two isoforms. One is an isoform that is released from the goblet cells and they get discharged into the lumen, they mix with the food. And then there's a second, even more important mucin 13 isoform that is on the top of the epithelial cell, in what some people call the brush border. That particular mucin is actually the actual barrier for digestive enzymes. Low molecular weight can get through, but not large molecular weight. This is how nature would like to see things. But if you now, um, look at the activity, this is again with a substrate that changes its fluorescent properties when you apply it on trypsin, you can read fluorescent units, the activity of the digestive enzymes in the lumen of the intestine. And those are orders of magnitude smaller, maybe 10, maybe 15, 20, but not much beyond. So the observation that we make at this point, wait a second, there is a huge proteolytic activity in the intestine, has to be, because we're digesting. And there's very low proteolytic activity in the plasma per se.

Um, so, uh, this comparison justifies to ask the question, okay, I can eat an intestine. This is, uh, set one style. I can digest that intestine, but I don't digest myself. How has nature come up with a solution to this problem? There are basically two mechanisms that have been proposed. The dominating mechanism is that people I've identified, a set of protease inhibitors, trypsin and chymotrypsin, that are synthesized in the liver. And these are permanently in an inactive form. They're binding molecules, permanently inhibiting trypsin and chymotrypsin. We have large amounts of these in our bloodstream, in fact, probably, um, they are of the amounts just like albumin and fibrinogen.

Nature had known for a while that somehow we have to have a protection against trypsin and chymotrypsin and the other serine proteases. The other mechanism is that nature has come up with an idea. Why don't we digest in the lumen of the intestine, and we then put a barrier? So that the digestive enzymes cannot get out. The barrier has to be clever, it has to allow nutrients, like individual amino acids, to get through, but not digestive enzymes. They are of the order of magnitude of 20k and larger. So as a result, we need a barrier. And this barrier is illustrated here. The blue color you see here, this is a villus, and this is in the lumen of the intestine, and this is at the base of the intestine. Um, and we labeled this particular structure with an agent that stains the mucin in blue color. So we see lots of mucin here, the entire intestine is covered by mucin. And there are specific isoforms. Um, there are two isoforms. One is an isoform that is released from the goblet cells and they get discharged into the lumen, they mix with the food. And then there's a second, even more important mucin 13 isoform that is on the top of the epithelial cell, in what some people call the brush border. That particular mucin is actually the actual barrier for digestive enzymes. Low molecular weight can get through, but not large molecular weight. This is how nature would like to see things. But if you now, um, look at the activity, this is again with a substrate that changes its fluorescent properties when you apply it on trypsin, you can read fluorescent units, the activity of the digestive enzymes in the lumen of the intestine. And those are orders of magnitude smaller, maybe 10, maybe 15, 20, but not much beyond. So the observation that we make at this point, wait a second, there is a huge proteolytic activity in the intestine, has to be, because we're digesting. And there's very low proteolytic activity in the plasma per se.

Um, so, uh, this comparison justifies to ask the question, okay, I can eat an intestine. This is, uh, set one style. I can digest that intestine, but I don't digest myself. How has nature come up with a solution to this problem? There are basically two mechanisms that have been proposed. The dominating mechanism is that people I've identified, a set of protease inhibitors, trypsin and chymotrypsin, that are synthesized in the liver. And these are permanently in an inactive form. They're binding molecules, permanently inhibiting trypsin and chymotrypsin.

Nature had known for a while that somehow we have to have a protection against trypsin and chymotrypsin and the other serine proteases. The other mechanism is that nature has come up with an idea. Why don't we digest in the lumen of the intestine, and we then put a barrier? So that the digestive enzymes cannot get out. The barrier has to be clever, it has to allow nutrients, like individual amino acids, to get through, but not digestive enzymes. They are of the order of magnitude of 20k and larger. So as a result, we need a barrier. And this barrier is illustrated here. The blue color you see here, this is a villus, and this is in the lumen of the intestine, and this is at the base of the intestine. Um, and we labeled this particular structure with an agent that stains the mucin in blue color. So we see lots of mucin here, the entire intestine is covered by mucin. And there are specific isoforms. Um, there are two isoforms. One is an isoform that is released from the goblet cells and they get discharged into the lumen, they mix with the food. And then there's a second, even more important mucin 13 isoform that is on the top of the epithelial cell, in what some people call the brush border. That particular mucin is actually the actual barrier for digestive enzymes. Low molecular weight can get through, but not large molecular weight. This is how nature would like to see things. But if you now, um, look at the activity, this is again with a substrate that changes its fluorescent properties when you apply it on trypsin, you can read fluorescent units, the activity of the digestive enzymes in the lumen of the intestine. And those are orders of magnitude smaller, maybe 10, maybe 15, 20, but not much beyond. So the observation that we make at this point, wait a second, there is a huge proteolytic activity in the intestine, has to be, because we're digesting. And there's very low proteolytic activity in the plasma per se.

Um, so, uh, this comparison justifies to ask the question, okay, I can eat an intestine. This is, uh, set one style. I can digest that intestine, but I don't digest myself. How has nature come up with a solution to this problem? There are basically two mechanisms that have been proposed. The dominating mechanism is that people I've identified, a set of protease inhibitors, trypsin and chymotrypsin, that are synthesized in the liver. And these are permanently in an inactive form. They're binding molecules, permanently inhibiting trypsin and chymotrypsin.

Nature had known for a while that somehow we have to have a protection against trypsin and chymotrypsin and the other serine proteases. The other mechanism is that nature has come up with an idea. Why don't we digest in the lumen of the intestine, and we then put a barrier? So that the digestive enzymes cannot get out. The barrier has to be clever, it has to allow nutrients, like individual amino acids, to get through, but not digestive enzymes. They are of the order of magnitude of 20k and larger. So as a result, we need a barrier. And this barrier is illustrated here. The blue color you see here, this is a villus, and this is in the lumen of the intestine, and this is at the base of the intestine. Um, and we labeled this particular structure with an agent that stains the mucin in blue color. So we see lots of mucin here, the entire intestine is covered by mucin. And there are specific isoforms. Um, there are two isoforms. One is an isoform that is released from the goblet cells and they get discharged into the lumen, they mix with the food. And then there's a second, even more important mucin 13 isoform that is on the top of the epithelial cell, in what some people call the brush border. That particular mucin is actually the actual barrier for digestive enzymes. Low molecular weight can get through, but not large molecular weight. This is how nature would like to see things. But if you now, um, look at the activity, this is again with a substrate that changes its fluorescent properties when you apply it on trypsin, you can read fluorescent units, the activity of the digestive enzymes in the lumen of the intestine. And those are orders of magnitude smaller, maybe 10, maybe 15, 20, but not much beyond. So the observation that we make at this point, wait a second, there is a huge proteolytic activity in the intestine, has to be, because we're digesting. And there's very low proteolytic activity in the plasma per se.

Um, so, uh, this comparison justifies to ask the question, okay, I can eat an intestine. This is, uh, set one style. I can digest that intestine, but I don't digest myself. How has nature come up with a solution to this problem? There are basically two mechanisms that have been proposed. The dominating mechanism is that people I've identified, a set of protease inhibitors, trypsin and chymotrypsin, that are synthesized in the liver. And these are permanently in an inactive form. They're binding molecules, permanently inhibiting trypsin and chymotrypsin.

Nature had known for a while that somehow we have to have a protection against trypsin and chymotrypsin and the other serine proteases. The other mechanism is that nature has come up with an idea. Why don't we digest in the lumen of the intestine, and we then put a barrier? So that the digestive enzymes cannot get out. The barrier has to be clever, it has to allow nutrients, like individual amino acids, to get through, but not digestive enzymes. They are of the order of magnitude of 20k and larger. So as a result, we need a barrier. And this barrier is illustrated here. The blue color you see here, this is a villus, and this is in the lumen of the intestine, and this is at the base of the intestine. Um, and we labeled this particular structure with an agent that stains the mucin in blue color. So we see lots of mucin here, the entire intestine is covered by mucin. And there are specific isoforms. Um, there are two isoforms. One is an isoform that is released from the goblet cells and they get discharged into the lumen, they mix with the food. And then there's a second, even more important mucin 13 isoform that is on the top of the epithelial cell, in what some people call the brush border. That particular mucin is actually the actual barrier for digestive enzymes. Low molecular weight can get through, but not large molecular weight. This is how nature would like to see things. But if you now, um, look at the activity, this is again with a substrate that changes its fluorescent properties when you apply it on trypsin, you can read fluorescent units, the activity of the digestive enzymes in the lumen of the intestine. And those are orders of magnitude smaller, maybe 10, maybe 15, 20, but not much beyond. So the observation that we make at this point, wait a second, there is a huge proteolytic activity in the intestine, has to be, because we're digesting. And there's very low proteolytic activity in the plasma per se.

Um, so, uh, this comparison justifies to ask the question, okay, I can eat an intestine. This is, uh, set one style. I can digest that intestine, but I don't digest myself. How has nature come up with a solution to this problem? There are basically two mechanisms that have been proposed. The dominating mechanism is that people I've identified, a set of protease inhibitors, trypsin and chymotrypsin, that are synthesized in the liver. And these are permanently in an inactive form. They're binding molecules, permanently inhibiting trypsin and chymotrypsin.

Nature had known for a while that somehow we have to have a protection against trypsin and chymotrypsin and the other serine proteases. The other mechanism is that nature has come up with an idea. Why don't we digest in the lumen of the intestine, and we then put a barrier? So that the digestive enzymes cannot get out. The barrier has to be clever, it has to allow nutrients, like individual amino acids, to get through, but not digestive enzymes. They are of the order of magnitude of 20k and larger. So as a result, we need a barrier. And this barrier is illustrated here. The blue color you see here, this is a villus, and this is in the lumen of the intestine, and this is at the base of the intestine. Um, and we labeled this particular structure with an agent that stains the mucin in blue color. So we see lots of mucin here, the entire intestine is covered by mucin. And there are specific isoforms. Um, there are two isoforms. One is an isoform that is released from the goblet cells and they get discharged into the lumen, they mix with the food. And then there's a second, even more important mucin 13 isoform that is on the top of the epithelial cell, in what some people call the brush border. That particular mucin is actually the actual barrier for digestive enzymes. Low molecular weight can get through, but not large molecular weight. This is how nature would like to see things. But if you now, um, look at the activity, this is again with a substrate that changes its fluorescent properties when you apply it on trypsin, you can read fluorescent units, the activity of the digestive enzymes in the lumen of the intestine. And those are orders of magnitude smaller, maybe 10, maybe 15, 20, but not much beyond. So the observation that we make at this point, wait a second, there is a huge proteolytic activity in the intestine, has to be, because we're digesting. And there's very low proteolytic activity in the plasma per se.

Um, so, uh, this comparison justifies to ask the question, okay, I can eat an intestine. This is, uh, set one style. I can digest that intestine, but I don't digest myself. How has nature come up with a solution to this problem? There are basically two mechanisms that have been proposed. The dominating mechanism is that people I've identified, a set of protease inhibitors, trypsin and chymotrypsin, that are synthesized in the liver. And these are permanently in an inactive form. They're binding molecules, permanently inhibiting trypsin and chymotrypsin.

Nature had known for a while that somehow we have to have a protection against trypsin and chymotrypsin and the other serine proteases. The other mechanism is that nature has come up with an idea. Why don't we digest in the lumen of the intestine, and we then put a barrier? So that the digestive enzymes cannot get out. The barrier has to be clever, it has to allow nutrients, like individual amino acids, to get through, but not digestive enzymes. They are of the order of magnitude of 20k and larger. So as a result, we need a barrier. And this barrier is illustrated here. The blue color you see here, this is a villus, and this is in the lumen of the intestine, and this is at the base of the intestine. Um, and we labeled this particular structure with an agent that stains the mucin in blue color. So we see lots of mucin here, the entire intestine is covered by mucin. And there are specific isoforms. Um, there are two isoforms. One is an isoform that is released from the goblet cells and they get discharged into the lumen, they mix with the food. And then there's a second, even more important mucin 13 isoform that is on the top of the epithelial cell, in what some people call the brush border. That particular mucin is actually the actual barrier for digestive enzymes. Low molecular weight can get through, but not large molecular weight. This is how nature would like to see things. But if you now, um, look at the activity, this is again with a substrate that changes its fluorescent properties when you apply it on trypsin, you can read fluorescent units, the activity of the digestive enzymes in the lumen of the intestine. And those are orders of magnitude smaller, maybe 10, maybe 15, 20, but not much beyond. So the observation that we make at this point, wait a second, there is a huge proteolytic activity in the intestine, has to be, because we're digesting. And there's very low proteolytic activity in the plasma per se.

Um, so, uh, this comparison justifies to ask the question, okay, I can eat an intestine. This is, uh, set one style. I can digest that intestine, but I don't digest myself. How has nature come up with a solution to this problem? There are basically two mechanisms that have been proposed. The dominating mechanism is that people I've identified, a set of protease inhibitors, trypsin and chymotrypsin, that are synthesized in the liver. And these are permanently in an inactive form. They're binding molecules, permanently inhibiting trypsin and chymotrypsin.
