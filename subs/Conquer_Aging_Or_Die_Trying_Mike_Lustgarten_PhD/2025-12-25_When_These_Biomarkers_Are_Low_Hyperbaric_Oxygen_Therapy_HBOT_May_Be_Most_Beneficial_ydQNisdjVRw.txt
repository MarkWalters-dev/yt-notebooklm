you have deficits in red blood cells, red blood cell number, you're going to have lower hemoglobin because hemoglobin's found in red blood cells, hemoglobin carries oxygen, your tissues aren't going to be as properly oxygenated actually in your cells aren't going to be as properly oxygenated as they should be. So Hbot within that context, you're essentially forcing oxygen into your body and potentially improving aerobic aerobic metabolism because now it has oxygen that it didn't have before. So that might be part of the reason why he says things like Hbot improves my biomarkers, maybe it's because he's his hemoglobin is lower than it should be. That said, at his chronological age, his hemoglobin is um he's got to figure out how to reverse that.
