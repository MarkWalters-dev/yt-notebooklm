00:00 - 00:06
**Speaker 1:** Since we're on the topic of skin, you know, and sun and what's optimal for skin health.
00:06 - 00:27
**Speaker 2:** So I haven't covered this in a video, I may though at some point, but so Astaxanthin, that's another aspect of my diet where I've been lacking. And so for people who know or don't already know, I eat fish every day and this comes almost exclusively from wild-caught sardines. Mostly for the omega-3 but obviously also for the protein, right?
00:27 - 00:58
**Speaker 2:** So there's no almost there has historically been no Astaxanthin which can come from things like salmon, which also has the omega-3 and protein. Uh, so why is Astaxanthin important? Well, uh, Astaxanthin may have positive benefits on skin and emphasis on "may" because there are only a few clinical trials and what I'm finding these days a lot on the interwebs is people will take one clinical study and in a, you know, very few people and this spreads like wildfire into "this is going to be great," "this works," right?
00:58 - 01:21
**Speaker 1:** I mean I see that for like just things like hydrogen water and, you know, methylene blue, there's like a little bit of published data in randomized controlled trials, not in vitro or cell.
01:21 - 01:52
**Speaker 2:** So anyway, emphasis on "may" with Astaxanthin. So these are two clinical trials and what I highlighted is in this study, and you know, we'll link to the papers in the video's description or the pinned comment. In the first study, they looked at on the left, which I highlighted, they did a study in women where it was 6 milligrams per day of Astaxanthin oral supplementation and 2 uh, what is that? 2 milliliters topically of Astaxanthin.
01:52 - 02:40
**Speaker 2:** So, uh, now which is optimal, is it get it from oral, you know, food supplement or getting it topically? I mean, I don't know which is optimal, probably topical probably be best if Astaxanthin really can make a dent on skin health and skin aging. To put the uh dose in perspective, I think average Astaxanthin, I mean I got this off the uh internet yesterday for uh, you know, to get 4 milligrams, I think that's per 100 grams of salmon. So you'd need a pretty decent sized salmon, uh wild-caught salmon, I wouldn't go with the farm stuff. Um, you know, so you'd probably need about 200 grams per day to get 8 milligrams of uh oral Astaxanthin per day.
02:40 - 03:20
**Speaker 2:** Nonetheless, they saw positive effects on skin health-related measures, right? So skin wrinkles, age spot size, skin texture, moisture content, which declines during aging. Uh, so potentially beneficial and this was a randomized controlled trial, this isn't, you know, association. And then in the second study that they did it was in men and here too, you know, without going through the data, showing the data, uh just going through the abstract, usually usually I show data but for now just going through the abstract. In men, uh crows feet wrinkle and elasticity and then trans-epidermal water loss, which uh water hydration, skin hydration declines during aging.
03:20 - 04:20
**Speaker 2:** So Astaxanthin was able to improve wrinkles and elasticity and uh reduce the trans-epidermal water loss. Now the reason I haven't focused so much on skin is because it can be be very tricky because if you're visually inspecting someone's skin and then looking at under the microscope and then you're trying to quantify what you see under the microscope, that can be very tricky and uh, you know, and that's as someone who's, you know, worked in a research lab and and done microsc- microscope related studies and now you've got to look at visual differences between, you know, a few samples, it's it's a challenge. So with that in mind, we can see that basically in the second study, again randomized controlled trial, this was looking at Astaxanthin supplementation uh in in response to UV induced skin deterioration in healthy people.
04:20 - 05:25
**Speaker 2:** Right? So what they gave was a more physiological dose of Astaxanthin, 4 milligrams per day as I mentioned isn't a crazy amount of salmon for 10 weeks. I just going into that idea of of, you know, tricky to quantify visually, right? So this is the skin swelling, the rectangles are the skin swelling in response to the UV induced exposure. So they made the skin, you know, swelling, it's it's called erythema, I'm probably mispronouncing it. Which is basically just skin, you know, redness and swelling. So this was before treatment, right? Uh, placebo and then Astaxanthin. And then placebo, uh, you know, post post-treatment plus post-placebo treatment and then Astaxanthin post-placebo treatment. So if you're going to quantify, if you just look at it visually you'd say, all right, well, dark red, light red, you know, darker red, lighter red. But, you know, then is the magnitude in the Astaxanthin group better than the what happened versus placebo?
05:25 - 06:19
**Speaker 2:** Because if you look at it, it looks like there is some improvement in less swelling in the placebo group too. So this is the emphasis on may improve skin health. Uh, you know, I'm not necessarily convinced yet, I'd probably place my biggest bet on topical as I mentioned but I'd like to see more studies, uh, you know, for Astaxanthin on skin health going forward. But then where it may get more interesting is that there's a recently published study coming from the ITP, which is the gold standard of lifespan-related studies at least in mice. And that's because they they look at supplementation in a few different test sites and use a very large sample size to evaluate lifespan potential lifespan related effects. So it's not a sample size of 10 mice versus 10 mice placebo versus supplement, it's like, you know, 200 plus mice per group across a few test sites. So when pooling the data and this is data in males, it didn't work in female mice on the same diets for the same duration when looking at median survival, this is 0.5 survival, that's the time when half the mice have died and half are still alive.
06:19 - 07:11
**Speaker 2:** When compared with the controls which are in red, the Astaxanthin treated male mice you can see that there's a significant shift to the right, so a significant increase in median lifespan. If you look at maximal lifespan, so you can look at, you know, 20% survival here, uh, there looks like there's a significant lengthening there too where it's pushed out, you know, a little bit. Uh, I didn't I didn't look in to see if max- maximal lifespan was impacted, I like to look at 10% survival, so when 10% of the mice are still alive and if we do that, it looks like there's, you know, they're basically overlapped curves. At least in terms of median survival and in mice seems to be promising. So with that in mind, I've cut down on my salmon- sardine intake and I've started to add wild-caught salmon, uh to about a 50-50 approach. So now I'm cooking it about once a week or once every two weeks, you know, um and then pre-packaging it and then, you know, eating that over for a few days, maybe it's more of a 40-60 still sardines. So I don't know what's optimal but some probably better than none, whether that could impact median lifespan or could impact skin aging and health, I don't know but some probably better than none.
