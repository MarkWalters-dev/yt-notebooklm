Last month, I blood tested for the seventh time in 2025 and noted that this is blood test number 65 since 2015. So, with that in mind, what's my biological age? That's what we'll see here. This is using Dr. Morgan LaVine's biological age calculator, Fenohage, and when entering the data for its nine component biomarkers, I get a biological age of 37 and a half years, which is 15.7 years younger than the chronological. Now, at this point in the video, many people often ask, how good is this biological clock? If you want to see how good this biological age clock is or isn't, I made a video specific to that, so it'll be in the right corner. All right, so where can I improve? Because if I'm not trying to get better, at worst, I'll stay the same or get worse. So, in the last video in this series, blood test number six, I focused on the MCV, which unfortunately got worse with this test. So, I won't go over the strategy again on how to fix that. I have made some changes that I think will impact MCV for the next test. So, stay tuned for that story in another video. But for this video, I want to focus on glucose, which at 102 mg per deciliter is my highest value ever, 63 tests going back to 2015. But before jumping into that story, let's take a look at more data because this is just one test. It's important to look at the net of all tests over a given period of time as a true pace of aging. So, with that in mind, for more context, I have 44 blood tests using this biological age clock since 2018. Which is what we'll see here. This is year-to-year change for biological age, more specifically, using Dr. Morgan LaVine's biological age calculator, Fenohage, and this is from 2018 to 2025, and again, those 44 tests. Now, when I first started measuring in 2018 to 2019, and note that I've been collecting blood test data since 2015, but I wasn't measuring H S C R P at every test. So, I started that in 2018 to 2019. So, over three tests in a two-year period, average biological age was 34.3 years. So, then I started including H S C R P at every test with six tests each in 2020 and 2021 for an average of 33.9 years in each of those two years. I then had my best data ever in 2022 with at 32.1 years, and I also increased the testing frequency to seven tests per year. Over another seven tests per year in 2023, the average got a bit worse to 32.9 years. And then I increased the testing frequency to eight times per year in 2024 with an average of 33.1 years, going in the wrong direction, albeit slowly. And then after the first seven tests in 2025, we can see that average biological age is currently 33.7 years, which includes the most recent test of 37.5 years. So, this is a true pace of aging. I know that there are other tests out there that claim to be a pace of aging, but a singular test may not represent a full year average, which then raises the question, how many tests per year do we need to have a true full year average? Maybe eight tests isn't enough, but I think that's closer to the truth than one or a couple of tests per year, and this is how I'm defining a pace of aging. So, with that in mind, there's good news and bad news. The good news is that I've resisted an age-related biological age increase using this test, as that collection of nine biomarkers that represent different organ systems. And that's important because even if all biomarkers stay the same, biological age using this test will increase by 0.9 years for every year of chronological age, such that my expected biological age using this test should be 39.7 years in 2025, whereas it's currently 33.7 years. So, that's a six-year reduction. So, this is good news. On the other hand, I mentioned there's also some bad news. And first, we can see that all six tests after the first test in 2025 have moved in the wrong direction, which is not good news. Additionally, if we start the clock from 2022 at my best data, we can also see the trend line moving in the wrong direction, going, you know, with an age-related biological age increase. But here too, note that there's an expected biological age increase of 0.9 years per year, such that in 2025, starting in 2022, expected biological age using this test should be 34.8 years. So, I'm currently one year below that. So, the aging rate for these nine biomarkers is still a bit slower, even though this is not my best data. All right, so let's review another example for studying the pace of aging and using glucose as an example, because that's emerged as a major weak spot, and if I'm not trying to make that better, if I'm not trying to improve it, it's potentially going to get even worse. Also, how can I reduce glucose? And I'm going to show some data, but that's coming up just in a minute. So, let's take a look at all glucose data for those 63 tests since 2015, with glucose plotted on the Y-axis against chronological age on the X. So, first, what's optimal? My reading of the literature is that 80 to 94 for blood glucose fasting levels of blood glucose may be optimal. But that's only part of the story. The other, and as I'm sure we all know, is that glucose levels increase during aging. So, it's not just about getting your data into the optimal range, but also resisting glucose's age-related increase is the other half of that story. So, where am I getting these data from? Well, I have a new Patreon tier dedicated specifically to what's optimal for biomarkers, including fasting levels of glucose. Besides glucose, it currently includes the 34 other biomarkers shown here, more than two hours of video content, 52 published references, and note that these aren't the reference ranges. This is what may be optimal based on my reading of the literature in the largest studies that exist. So, if you're interested in that, check it out. All right, so back to the data. And if we look at all of my data over those 63 tests, average glucose is within optimal, 90 mg per deciliter. So, technically, I could stop there, just give it a check mark and it's all good. But there's more to the story. When I run the correlation for glucose versus chronological age, we can see that there is a significant correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.33 and the P value at less than 0.005 at 0.008. So, here we can see I've been unable to resist the age-related increase for glucose, so we give that an X. If I stopped at just looking at the average, that would only be part of the story. It's important to look at all of the data within its full context, and here we can see that glucose is increasing within my data, so I've got to try to flip this sooner rather than later. And in terms of that flipping it sooner rather than later, we can see that four of the most recent tests have moved out of optimal. So, I've got to find a way to move it back into the optimal and also resist the age-related change for blood levels, fasting blood levels of glucose. Which then brings us to, how can I reverse the glucose increase? So now we're going to take a look at diet versus glucose correlations. So, how am I able to do this? For people who don't know, I've weighed almost all of my food since 2015 with a food scale. I then enter that data into a diet tracking app, Cronometer, and if you want to use Cronometer yourself, there's a discount link in the video description. I then pull the Cronometer data into a spreadsheet, and then every blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake, such that if there's 50 days in between blood tests, by taking the average dietary intake over those 50 days and then lining it up with the blood test, every blood test now has a corresponding dietary intake. So, I can look at correlations. With that in mind, let's take a look at the top of the correlations list, which is shown here. In the middle, we've got the correlation coefficient, lower case R, and then to the right, we've got the P value. And note that the threshold for statistical significance that I generally use is less than 0.005, so this is even more strict. This is the top of the list, less than 0.01. And if you want to see the full list, that's in the biomarker correlations tier on Patreon, which doesn't just include glucose, but all of the other biomarkers and their correlations with diet that I'm tracking. So, if you're interested in that, check it out. All right, so back to the data. And if we look at all of my data over those 63 tests, average glucose is within optimal, 90 mg per deciliter.

So, here we can see I've been unable to resist the age-related increase for glucose, so we give that an X. If I stopped at just looking at the average, that would only be part of the story. It's important to look at all of the data within its full context, and here we can see that glucose is increasing within my data, so I've got to try to flip this sooner rather than later. And in terms of that flipping it sooner rather than later, we can see that four of the most recent tests have moved out of optimal. So, I've got to find a way to move it back into the optimal and also resist the age-related change for blood levels, fasting blood levels of glucose. Which then brings us to, how can I reverse the glucose increase? So, now we're going to take a look at diet versus glucose correlations. So, how am I able to do this? For people who don't know, I've weighed almost all of my food since 2015 with a food scale. I then enter that data into a diet tracking app, Cronometer, and if you want to use Cronometer yourself, there's a discount link in the video description. I then pull the Cronometer data into a spreadsheet, and then every blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake, such that if there's 50 days in between blood tests, by taking the average dietary intake over those 50 days and then lining it up with the blood test, every blood test now has a corresponding dietary intake. So, I can look at correlations. With that in mind, let's take a look at the top of the correlations list, which is shown here. In the middle, we've got the correlation coefficient, lower case R, and then to the right, we've got the P value. And note that the threshold for statistical significance that I generally use is less than 0.005, so this is even more strict. This is the top of the list, less than 0.01. And if you want to see the full list, that's in the biomarker correlations tier on Patreon, which doesn't just include glucose, but all of the other biomarkers and their correlations with diet that I'm tracking. So, if you're interested in that, check it out. All right, so back to the data. And if we look at all of my data over those 63 tests, average glucose is within optimal, 90 mg per deciliter. So, technically, I could stop there, just give it a check mark and it's all good. But there's more to the story. When I run the correlation for glucose versus chronological age, we can see that there is a significant correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.33 and the P value at less than 0.005 at 0.008.

I then pull the Cronometer data into a spreadsheet, and then every blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake, such that if there's 50 days in between blood tests, by taking the average dietary intake over those 50 days and then lining it up with the blood test, every blood test now has a corresponding dietary intake. So, I can look at correlations. With that in mind, let's take a look at the top of the correlations list, which is shown here. In the middle, we've got the correlation coefficient, lower case R, and then to the right, we've got the P value. And note that the threshold for statistical significance that I generally use is less than 0.005, so this is even more strict. This is the top of the list, less than 0.01. And if you want to see the full list, that's in the biomarker correlations tier on Patreon, which doesn't just include glucose, but all of the other biomarkers and their correlations with diet that I'm tracking. So, if you're interested in that, check it out. All right, so back to the data. And if we look at all of my data over those 63 tests, average glucose is within optimal, 90 mg per deciliter. So, technically, I could stop there, just give it a check mark and it's all good. But there's more to the story. When I run the correlation for glucose versus chronological age, we can see that there is a significant correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.33 and the P value at less than 0.005 at 0.008. So, here we can see I've been unable to resist the age-related increase for glucose, so we give that an X. If I stopped at just looking at the average, that would only be part of the story. It's important to look at all of the data within its full context, and here we can see that glucose is increasing within my data, so I've got to try to flip this sooner rather than later. And in terms of that flipping it sooner rather than later, we can see that four of the most recent tests have moved out of optimal. So, I've got to find a way to move it back into the optimal and also resist the age-related change for blood levels, fasting blood levels of glucose. Which then brings us to, how can I reverse the glucose increase? So, now we're going to take a look at diet versus glucose correlations. So, how am I able to do this?

When I run the correlation for glucose versus chronological age, we can see that there is a significant correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.33 and the P value at less than 0.005 at 0.008. So, here we can see I've been unable to resist the age-related increase for glucose, so we give that an X. If I stopped at just looking at the average, that would only be part of the story. It's important to look at all of the data within its full context, and here we can see that glucose is increasing within my data, so I've got to try to flip this sooner rather than later. And in terms of that flipping it sooner rather than later, we can see that four of the most recent tests have moved out of optimal. So, I've got to find a way to move it back into the optimal and also resist the age-related change for blood levels, fasting blood levels of glucose. Which then brings us to, how can I reverse the glucose increase? So, now we're going to take a look at diet versus glucose correlations. So, how am I able to do this? For people who don't know, I've weighed almost all of my food since 2015 with a food scale. I then enter that data into a diet tracking app, Cronometer, and if you want to use Cronometer yourself, there's a discount link in the video description. I then pull the Cronometer data into a spreadsheet, and then every blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake, such that if there's 50 days in between blood tests, by taking the average dietary intake over those 50 days and then lining it up with the blood test, every blood test now has a corresponding dietary intake. So, I can look at correlations. With that in mind, let's take a look at the top of the correlations list, which is shown here. In the middle, we've got the correlation coefficient, lower case R, and then to the right, we've got the P value. And note that the threshold for statistical significance that I generally use is less than 0.005, so this is even more strict. This is the top of the list, less than 0.01. And if you want to see the full list, that's in the biomarker correlations tier on Patreon, which doesn't just include glucose, but all of the other biomarkers and their correlations with diet that I'm tracking. So, if you're interested in that, check it out. All right, so back to the data. And if we look at all of my data over those 63 tests, average glucose is within optimal, 90 mg per deciliter.

I then pull the Cronometer data into a spreadsheet, and then every blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake, such that if there's 50 days in between blood tests, by taking the average dietary intake over those 50 days and then lining it up with the blood test, every blood test now has a corresponding dietary intake. So, I can look at correlations. With that in mind, let's take a look at the top of the correlations list, which is shown here. In the middle, we've got the correlation coefficient, lower case R, and then to the right, we've got the P value. And note that the threshold for statistical significance that I generally use is less than 0.005, so this is even more strict. This is the top of the list, less than 0.01. And if you want to see the full list, that's in the biomarker correlations tier on Patreon, which doesn't just include glucose, but all of the other biomarkers and their correlations with diet that I'm tracking. So, if you're interested in that, check it out. All right, so back to the data. And if we look at all of my data over those 63 tests, average glucose is within optimal, 90 mg per deciliter. So, technically, I could stop there, just give it a check mark and it's all good. But there's more to the story. When I run the correlation for glucose versus chronological age, we can see that there is a significant correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.33 and the P value at less than 0.005 at 0.008. So, here we can see I've been unable to resist the age-related increase for glucose, so we give that an X. If I stopped at just looking at the average, that would only be part of the story. It's important to look at all of the data within its full context, and here we can see that glucose is increasing within my data, so I've got to try to flip this sooner rather than later. And in terms of that flipping it sooner rather than later, we can see that four of the most recent tests have moved out of optimal. So, I've got to find a way to move it back into the optimal and also resist the age-related change for blood levels, fasting blood levels of glucose. Which then brings us to, how can I reverse the glucose increase? So, now we're going to take a look at diet versus glucose correlations. So, how am I able to do this?

When I run the correlation for glucose versus chronological age, we can see that there is a significant correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.33 and the P value at less than 0.005 at 0.008. So, here we can see I've been unable to resist the age-related increase for glucose, so we give that an X. If I stopped at just looking at the average, that would only be part of the story. It's important to look at all of the data within its full context, and here we can see that glucose is increasing within my data, so I've got to try to flip this sooner rather than later. And in terms of that flipping it sooner rather than later, we can see that four of the most recent tests have moved out of optimal. So, I've got to find a way to move it back into the optimal and also resist the age-related change for blood levels, fasting blood levels of glucose. Which then brings us to, how can I reverse the glucose increase? So, now we're going to take a look at diet versus glucose correlations. So, how am I able to do this? For people who don't know, I've weighed almost all of my food since 2015 with a food scale. I then enter that data into a diet tracking app, Cronometer, and if you want to use Cronometer yourself, there's a discount link in the video description. I then pull the Cronometer data into a spreadsheet, and then every blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake, such that if there's 50 days in between blood tests, by taking the average dietary intake over those 50 days and then lining it up with the blood test, every blood test now has a corresponding dietary intake. So, I can look at correlations. With that in mind, let's take a look at the top of the correlations list, which is shown here. In the middle, we've got the correlation coefficient, lower case R, and then to the right, we've got the P value. And note that the threshold for statistical significance that I generally use is less than 0.005, so this is even more strict. This is the top of the list, less than 0.01. And if you want to see the full list, that's in the biomarker correlations tier on Patreon, which doesn't just include glucose, but all of the other biomarkers and their correlations with diet that I'm tracking. So, if you're interested in that, check it out. All right, so back to the data. And if we look at all of my data over those 63 tests, average glucose is within optimal, 90 mg per deciliter.

I then pull the Cronometer data into a spreadsheet, and then every blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake, such that if there's 50 days in between blood tests, by taking the average dietary intake over those 50 days and then lining it up with the blood test, every blood test now has a corresponding dietary intake. So, I can look at correlations. With that in mind, let's take a look at the top of the correlations list, which is shown here. In the middle, we've got the correlation coefficient, lower case R, and then to the right, we've got the P value. And note that the threshold for statistical significance that I generally use is less than 0.005, so this is even more strict. This is the top of the list, less than 0.01. And if you want to see the full list, that's in the biomarker correlations tier on Patreon, which doesn't just include glucose, but all of the other biomarkers and their correlations with diet that I'm tracking. So, if you're interested in that, check it out. All right, so back to the data. And if we look at all of my data over those 63 tests, average glucose is within optimal, 90 mg per deciliter. So, technically, I could stop there, just give it a check mark and it's all good. But there's more to the story. When I run the correlation for glucose versus chronological age, we can see that there is a significant correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.33 and the P value at less than 0.005 at 0.008. So, here we can see I've been unable to resist the age-related increase for glucose, so we give that an X. If I stopped at just looking at the average, that would only be part of the story. It's important to look at all of the data within its full context, and here we can see that glucose is increasing within my data, so I've got to try to flip this sooner rather than later. And in terms of that flipping it sooner rather than later, we can see that four of the most recent tests have moved out of optimal. So, I've got to find a way to move it back into the optimal and also resist the age-related change for blood levels, fasting blood levels of glucose. Which then brings us to, how can I reverse the glucose increase? So, now we're going to take a look at diet versus glucose correlations. So, how am I able to do this?

When I run the correlation for glucose versus chronological age, we can see that there is a significant correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.33 and the P value at less than 0.005 at 0.008. So, here we can see I've been unable to resist the age-related increase for glucose, so we give that an X. If I stopped at just looking at the average, that would only be part of the story. It's important to look at all of the data within its full context, and here we can see that glucose is increasing within my data, so I've got to try to flip this sooner rather than later. And in terms of that flipping it sooner rather than later, we can see that four of the most recent tests have moved out of optimal. So, I've got to find a way to move it back into the optimal and also resist the age-related change for blood levels, fasting blood levels of glucose. Which then brings us to, how can I reverse the glucose increase? So, now we're going to take a look at diet versus glucose correlations. So, how am I able to do this? For people who don't know, I've weighed almost all of my food since 2015 with a food scale. I then enter that data into a diet tracking app, Cronometer, and if you want to use Cronometer yourself, there's a discount link in the video description. I then pull the Cronometer data into a spreadsheet, and then every blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake, such that if there's 50 days in between blood tests, by taking the average dietary intake over those 50 days and then lining it up with the blood test, every blood test now has a corresponding dietary intake. So, I can look at correlations. With that in mind, let's take a look at the top of the correlations list, which is shown here. In the middle, we've got the correlation coefficient, lower case R, and then to the right, we've got the P value. And note that the threshold for statistical significance that I generally use is less than 0.005, so this is even more strict. This is the top of the list, less than 0.01. And if you want to see the full list, that's in the biomarker correlations tier on Patreon, which doesn't just include glucose, but all of the other biomarkers and their correlations with diet that I'm tracking. So, if you're interested in that, check it out. All right, so back to the data. And if we look at all of my data over those 63 tests, average glucose is within optimal, 90 mg per deciliter.

I then pull the Cronometer data into a spreadsheet, and then every blood test has a corresponding average dietary intake, such that if there's 50 days in between blood tests, by taking the average dietary intake over those 50 days and then lining it up with the blood test, every blood test now has a corresponding dietary intake. So, I can look at correlations. With that in mind, let's take a look at the top of the correlations list, which is shown here. In the middle, we've got the correlation coefficient, lower case R, and then to the right, we've got the P value. And note that the threshold for statistical significance that I generally use is less than 0.005, so this is even more strict. This is the top of the list, less than 0.01. And if you want to see the full list, that's in the biomarker correlations tier on Patreon, which doesn't just include glucose, but all of the other biomarkers and their correlations with diet that I'm tracking. So, if you're interested in that, check it out. All right, so back to the data. And if we look at all of my data over those 63 tests, average glucose is within optimal, 90 mg per deciliter. So, technically, I could stop there, just give it a check mark and it's all good. But there's more to the story. When I run the correlation for glucose versus chronological age, we can see that there is a significant correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.33 and the P value at less than 0.005 at 0.008. So, here we can see I've been unable to resist the age-related increase for glucose, so we give that an X. If I stopped at just looking at the average, that would only be part of the story. It's important to look at all of the data within its full context, and here we can see that glucose is increasing within my data, so I've got to try to flip this sooner rather than later. And in terms of that flipping it sooner rather than later, we can see that four of the most recent tests have moved out of optimal. So, I've got to find a way to move it back into the optimal and also resist the age-related change for blood levels, fasting blood levels of glucose. Which then brings us to, how can I reverse the glucose increase? So, now we're going to take a look at diet versus glucose correlations. So, how am I able to do this?
