Hey everyone, today's guest is Tony Rugia, but you may know him better as I am longevity on YouTube. Recently, Tony pitched a brilliant hypothesis that a the major cause of death in a centenarian who lived to 117 years old, may not be related to cardiovascular disease, cancer, etc. age-related diseases, but instead, motor unit loss and correspondingly, respiratory failure. So today, if you missed that video, good the good news is Tony is going to present some of that data, and I'll link to the Tony's video in the right corner. So if you missed it, you can check it out. But with that, welcome Tony, and let's see what you got. Okay, thank you for inviting me, Mike. Um, so let's get right into it. Uh, her name um, the mystery woman, she lived to 117 years. Her name was Maria Branyas Morera as you can see on the slide here on the screen. 1907-2024. A team of scientists studied her for the last, I think 15 months of her life, her last breath. They measured everything on her, DNA, blood, microbiome, proteins, biological age, epigenetics and much more. She she had perfect biomarkers except for LDL, we'll get to that in a second. But, my question was, if she was so perfect, if everything was so perfect about about this woman, why did she die at 117? Why not 120? Why not 125? Why not 140? So, I'm giving you my hypothesis of why this is ha, why this happens. So now, I'm going to share, what I want to speak to you about her biomarkers first, before I continue. So, we're going to go through her lipid profile. You see this on the screen, Mike? The lipid profile? Yeah. Yep. Okay. Look on the left side, you can see her cholesterol, everything is perfect. Her VLDL-C, everything is, I'm not going to go through all the numbers, but you can check yourself, like I'll give you samples, like HDL-TG ratio is 0.81, it's below the 0.25. Everything is perfect on the left side. Now, let's go to the right side, and you can see that this is her lipid profile in a circle here, and now here she, by the way, her glycoprotein A and B, which is inflammatory biomarkers, were also perfect. But in here it's yellow, one is yellow, glycoprotein B, but it's still not bad. It's right, it's right at the recommended value. But everything else is green. Okay, everything else. HDL, except for one red part here, where you see the LDL-C, Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, where it was high. The number, her number is not in the study, but I heard the lead scientist in one of the interviews, he said that it was 129 somewhere around there. But to me, I don't consider it high. I don't consider that harmful, because everything else was so perfect with her. She has like a dream profile. This is just my opinion. I don't believe the LDL-C caused any harm, because everything else was protecting her. Now, let me go to the next one here. Take a look at her mitochondria. The letters on the bottom, the SOCs, SOX and the other one, that's just a measurement test. I think that's just a measurement test, so don't get confused with that. But, look, she's in orange, by the way. And look, look at her mitochondria. Look at how much stronger it is compared to the controls. Her mitochondria in both tests is stronger than 25 year olds. That and she's 117. Look, look how much stronger it is. Look how much higher. Look. I mean, she has better mitochondria than people in their 20s. I'm, I'm shocked at this. At 117 years old, I can't believe this. The woman didn't didn't jog, didn't do anything. She just has this. Now let's go to the next one, her microbiome. The control group was 445 adults, 22 to 105. And here she was 116 years old. She's in orange. And you can see her microbiome is up to par with all of them, all the control group. But, look at the shaded area, the Bifidobacteria. Now that's, it's shaded. You see how much higher it is? She ate a lot of, in the study it says this. Plus, the lead scientist said it in an interview, she ate so much yogurt, it was incredible. He couldn't believe how much yogurt she ate. That's why her Bifidobacteria was so high. And, you know, Bifidobacteria is is protective for your immune system, it helps you carry nutrients to all your organs, it protects your gut. It's, it's one of the most powerful bacteria in your microbiome, and she had plenty of that. More than anybody in the in the control group. And as you can see from the screen here. Let's go to the next one. Now, let's also talk about her biological age. Her biological, she was 116. You see, she's in blue there. All three her urine, saliva, she's 116 plus a little. In one of the tests, the Hannum test, she was 83 years old. I mean, look at this. And the, all that she was was the B-U-L-P test, where she was about 108, 107.9. So, she was younger biologically in all the tests. Even the Levine test, she was 89 years old, in the Horvath test she was 98. I mean, she was young biologically all across the board. Let's go to the next one. Now, take a look at her DNA. This is concerning the biological age test also. The one represents the highest, these are the methylation patterns. Look at her, she's in the orange here. They were as strong as 20 some year olds. Look at, the one is the highest. She was up in the top. Look at the first, the first row. The one right next to her is 23 years old. She's 116. And she's right there with with them. 20, she had the, I mean, she had the methylation patterns of a young person. All, on all three, in all three rows, she was on top. Usually, when you get old like that, it goes down. You'll be way down the line. But she was at the very top, almost. That's, that's her, that's her methylation patterns. Now let me go to the, this is the part I want to speak about, the telomere. On the left side, you see Maria's telomere length was around eight kilobases. That's the short, out of anyone tested in that, in that entire group. She has shorter than, the the on the left side, the red square, with the orange dot. She was way down there. In other words, that dot represents her age. So, it's nothing special about her telomere. On the right side, her telomere showed her true age. She was way, look, look at the bottom of the aging years, it matches exactly her age, about 116, 117 years. She was way, way above everyone else. But, what the researcher said, what the study said, that the telomeres didn't didn't didn't make a guy. It was not the cause of her death. It was like more like a clock that measured time past, it was not the killer. She, she didn't die of any telomere disease, cancer or disease. That's what, so, we have to, I mean, I'm, I'm saying the telomere didn't kill her because the evidence doesn't, didn't show this. Now, let's go to the next one. Her longevity genes. On the left side is all her longevity genes. She was protected by a lot of longevity genes, for cognition, blue protection, cardiovascular, circulatory protection, genome maintenance, DNA repair, immune system, metabolic, mitochondrial efficiency, inflammation, you name it, muscle, microbiome, detoxification, Foxo3A, Sirt1, 3, 6, Klotho, ApoE, she and she has many others. But there's one, there's one I want to speak about. It's called the timeless gene. You can see on the left, I put it in a blue square. She was, they also found a variant, she had a variant of the timeless gene. The timeless gene was discovered in fruit flies. It has to do with the their circadian rhythm. But then they discovered it in humans, also. But not only is it circadian rhythm, it keeps your DNA from tearing apart whenever it divides. It's like, like I I wrote on the screen here, it's like a guardian angel sitting on your genome. Just says there, protects your DNA. That's why she had such good metabolic patterns. It has to be one of the reasons. Okay, now, I want to, I want to, before, Mike, can I stop this here? Yes, sure. Because, I'm going to stop, I'm going to stop sharing the screen for a second so I can talk. All right? Yeah, yeah, for sure. Okay. Now, I want to transition, I just showed you how perfect she was biologically, internally. But, they didn't mention it in the study, but they mentioned it in the interview that she had sarcopenia. And they were given a protein bottle for sarcopenia. Protein bottle doesn't help sarcopenia if you're 60 years old. Let alone, 117. Sarcopenia is a systemic disease. It's systemic. It doesn't happen in just one, it starts slowly in certain muscles, but then it spreads as the years go on, she was 117. It spreads to every single muscle. I'm talking about your eye muscles, every muscle, from little to the biggest, it spreads, it's systemic. Your diaphragm is a muscle. Your diaphragm is what helps contract and expand your lungs. Without your diaphragm, your lungs don't work. Your diaphragm is what pushes up and down. That's what makes you breathe. Now, let your some common sense here. She had sarcopenia. She had to have sarcopenia also on her diaphragm, which, there is a name for it, it's called respiratory sarcopenia. Many people are not aware of this. Respiratory sarcopenia is the weakening of the of the diaphragm. So, what causes respiratory, what what causes, first of all, now I want to transition into motor units. The diaphragm is controlled by phrenic motor units. Not regular motor units, but they are the same. That's just phrenic, P-H-R-E-N-I-C, phrenic motor units. They are located in the C3, C4, cervical three, cervical three, cervical five of your spine. That's where they're located. The signal from the brain, from the motor cortex to the brainstem, goes through them. They, that signal is relayed to the diaphragm to make it contract. That's if all your motor units are there. Now, now I want to get into the other screen. I want to show you what happens before I continue. I want to show you, and by the way, what I'm showing you here is not my opinion. I took these from research, and I'm I personally made a graph from the research I took. So, I'm going to share the screen one more time. You see the screen, on you see the the chart, the chart, Mike? Yep. Okay. You can see when we're born, we're born. And by the way, before I continue, the diaphragm is made up of 55% about 55% slow twitch type one, 21% type two A motor units, and 24% type two X motor units. That's what the diaphragm consists of. Just so you know. And in aging, the first to go is always the type two X. They are always the first to go, and it's part of the aging process. It's not much we can do about it. We can slow it down, but we can't stop it. Or reverse it. But anyway, let me get into the graph here. When we're born, we have 100% of our motor units. As we age through our life, now, research says that hallmarks of aging exist from the day we're born. Telomere attrition starts then. Epigenetic drift starts early age. But, have you ever noticed from the day you're born, to about 20, 25, we get stronger. If, by the way, I'm not talking about people that have a disease, I'm talking about normal people that are healthy. They get stronger as they age to the age of 25, even though some of the hallmarks are present. So, again, this is my opinion, because all your motor units are there, especially the fast ones. They are protective against these hallmarks. To about the age of 20, 25, is from the research I found, we start losing our fast motor units around the third decade of our life. Early third decade of life, which is under 25, 20 to 25. Then, it gradually, you don't feel this as you age, but, you notice it physically because you slow down a little bit. You don't, in your mind, you say, I'm just as fast, but when you time yourself, you're not as fast. You're not as stronger. Usain Bolt can tell you this, I mean, the best athletes, power athletes will tell you they don't get stronger as they age, they get weaker. Fast motor units are the reason for the power. You lose power before you lose strength, before you lose mass. Power is the first one to go. Now, look at the, look at the screen here from 20 to 40. Gradual loss, you don't feel nothing. Even by the age of 50, you're losing it in the, your 40, you start feeling a little pains here and there, you're a little weaker, you're a little slower. Your sprint is not as fast, your jump is not as good. Athletes retire in their late 30s for a reason. But by the time you're 60, you may have about 80% left. Now, these are not perfect numbers. You may have a few percentages more, or a few percentages less, depending on where you are. But by 60 is when it starts to accelerate. No matter who you are, no matter what sport you played, no matter what supplement, what diet you did, it all starts at 60 years old. Around, I don't know, about around there. Again, not exactly. It could start at 58, it could start at 62. But it starts here. Boom! At 70, 71 years old. According to P. Secci, at 71 years old, you lost 40% of your motor units, all your motor units. At 75, you're down to 50% of all your motor units. By older age, he didn't say the exact age, but I am deducing, I give it 90 years old, 95, even 100, you're down to about 10% or less, 8%, 9%. Now, because you slowed down so much, you lose motor units. The the less you move, the more you lose. So, I calculated that at 117, she had to be down to 2, 3% of her motor units. That, and this is not a, this is a logical explanation. This this is not something I'm just speculating because if we're down to about 10% by 90, 95, 100, at 117, you're not moving. You're going to go down to that low. So, now I want to get back to the diaphragm. That means, motor units, again, in my opinion, is the upstream, the catalyst, the beginning of sarcopenia. People think you get sarcopenia when you get old. Sarcopenia, everyone in the world gets it. Sarcopenia means loss of mass, loss of strength. Everyone in the world starts losing, it's universal, uniformly, in your 30, you start losing muscle mass and muscle strength. Therefore, you don't have sarcopenia, but you have pre-sarcopenia, a small percentage. You're, some people maintain it longer, some people maintain it less, depending on their training. But again, this is my opinion, that everyone has the symptoms of sarcopenia. Everyone. It's just that by the time you're 75, you hit that magic cliff. Fall off a cliff. That's when you're frail. Frailty sets in. No matter what you did in your life, even the best powerlifters. Yes, some of them go into their 80s lifting, but they're not anywhere near what they were. It shows. But at the time they're 90, I don't have to tell you. You could look it up yourself. So, now let's transition into the diaphragm. That means she lost her motor units of the diaphragm. That means she had very few motor units of the diaphragm. Forget about the fast ones. She couldn't cough. Because type two X is what makes you take deep breaths, cough, sneeze. So, if she had an infection, if she, she couldn't bring that up. That's one thing. But let's go into the breathing of the diaphragm itself. Why did she die in her sleep? Why didn't she die when she was awake? Why she didn't die when she was speaking to the nurse? Or eating, or watching TV or just sitting up on the bed, or just, whatever. She was just reading. How come she didn't die then? Again, this is my hypothesis. I could be wrong. I could be wrong. She died in her sleep. I believe she died in a REM phase of her sleep. Rapid eye movement phase. And I'm going to explain why I believe she died, and why she died peacefully also. Breathe, when when you breathe, there are, first let me explain, when you're awake. You have voluntary and automatic breathing. Automatic means, you don't even think about it. You your body just breathe on its own. Right? You don't think about it, it just breathes. Voluntary is when you want to sing, scream, uh, talk, uh, whatever, any you're doing, you're making a movement with your mouth, that's called voluntary breathing. Your motor cortex, your cerebral cortex is helps you with the breathing, with the voluntary breathing. Also, other muscles help you with your breathing. Not just the diaphragm. You got the intercostal muscles in your, between your ribs that help. Your neck muscles, your shoulder muscles, they all chip in to help when you're awake. That's why you may not die when you're, when you're awake. The other muscles are helping you. Now, what happens when you sleep? When you go to sleep, your muscles are still awake. But when you hit REM, that's the dream state. Your body goes into what's called REM atonia, A-T-O-N-I-A. In other words, you're paralyzed. It paralyzes your body. Because it doesn't want you to act out your dreams. If you're in a dream, dreaming that you're throwing punches, you're not going to throw punches while you're sleeping, or if you're running, you're not going to just get up and start running. That's why your body's, your body's frozen. It's, it's an it's atonia, it's in a paralyzed state. Except for your heart, your eyes, rapid eye movement, your eyes are moving. Your heart, your eyes, and yours truly, your diaphragm. So, when you're sleeping, in REM, the only thing making you breathe is your diaphragm. The helper muscles are paralyzed. Okay? So, here's the catch. This is why I believe she died in her sleep. The signal is already weak. Start at 117 years old. Her signal, her, her firing rates are already weak. It gets there in C3, C4, C5, motor neurons are there. She only has a few left. There aren't that many there left. She's 2%, even if you give her 5%, which she didn't have 5% because she was in a wheelchair, she couldn't not move. They were feeding her, they were bathing her, so she couldn't not move. So, it's that's proof that she had no motor units left. That's proof right there. That means, when you're sleeping, and the diaphragm doesn't have those helper muscles, what happens? Carbon dioxide goes up. Oxygen goes down. Boom! You take your last breath. And why is it that she died peacefully? Because she was paralyzed. She was paralyzed. There was nothing, there is no, if the muscle is paralyzed, she's not going to scream, she's not going to choke, she's not going to do anything. She's just paralyzed. Boom, what happens? Take the last breath, and soon thereafter, your heart stops. And it didn't stop because of cardiovascular issues. That's why they didn't find, the experts could not find the reason why she died. And these, these team of scientists are not stupid. They're 20, 30 PhDs. They were measuring everything on her, everything, every biomarker. They found nothing. They said, we have no clue. We have, he said it publicly, we have no clue why she died. And this is again, this is my opinion. I could be wrong. Maybe they, if they would have measured her diaphragm, they would have seen that she had no motor units left there. And uh, I believe that the diaphragm is very important. I believe that, it's, to me, again, I I spoke to you earlier, Mike, that your gene, she's proof that your genes do not set the maximum lifespan. She had all the longevity genes, perfect biomarkers. Cardiovascular system perfect. Mitochondria perfect. Uh, what else she had? She had blood. Biological age, younger. She died peacefully in her sleep. And they have no clue how she did it. I mean, how, how it happens? No clue. I mean, that's, think about this. And these, they watched her to the last minute. But they didn't measure the motor units. They didn't measure the neuromuscular system. She had sarcopenia. She had this. They know she had this. She couldn't move. She was in a wheelchair. And that's why I believe she died. That's what I take about on this. From, and this is not my guess. I'm using evidence here. I'm using logical evidence. I could be wrong. I'm hypothesizing. But I believe that motor unit loss may be the reason why we have the maximum lifespan ceiling. And if we could, you can see the, I'm still showing the the diagram, Mike? Yep. You see the diagram? I believe that if we reach 75, because I made another video. At 75 years old, this coincides with the 75 year cliff that everybody experiences around, about around that area. That no matter how healthy people are, they fall off a cliff here. Their health, everyone. Even if it's a couple years later, they all begin to get on meds, or they get weaker, or they, their body starts aching, they get diseases. Uh, most people have a disease at this age. I believe if we could push this back a little, to like, maybe 40%, 30%. By the way, systemic-wide. Not just where you go to the gym, and you do curls and bench press, and pull-ups, and squats. I'm talking about training the neuromuscular system from head to toe. If you could slow down the loss of motor units by 10%, including in your diaphragm, you may prolong, I'm not saying it's going to happen, everything else should be fit. More, there's more factors here. But, if you do everything right, but you don't fix this part here, you're not going to go past 115, 120. One made it allegedly to 122, but she also was like a wheelchair bound. So, that's just my opinion. That's what, that's what my channel is about. That's what I work on. To try to slow the 75 year mark here, delay it. And that's what I have to say. Brilliant, Tony. I think, I think, I think Mike. Tony. I'm not sharing the screen. I'm not sharing the screen. So, yeah, that was brilliant Tony. I think you're spot on. I agree 100%. Uh, so let me, uh, I've got some data to share that supports what, supports your hypothesis. So, yeah, so I think I've got some data especially with ALS that links with your hypothesis of respiratory failure being a leading cause of death at super longevity. So, here, hey, look. Let me let me go through. So, This is, oh my God. I didn't know this. Yeah, so respiratory failure is the top cause of death in the neurodegenerative disease, uh, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. For those who don't know, uh, this is Stephen Hawking, who's probably the most famous, uh, person to be diagnosed with ALS. Uh, and he somehow lived 55 years with an ALS diagnosis, which, for most people who don't don't know, ALS is a very quick disease. I mean, after a few years, it's, uh, it's a death sentence. Normally it's five years. Normally, normally it's five years. Five years. Yeah. But, I'll let you talk. I'll let you talk. I'll let you tell them what ALS is. Go ahead. Sorry. So that he lived 55 years, there's, it's promising, it's promising news for all of us, especially in delaying neurodegenerative disease and respiratory failure as a cause of death. So, in terms of causes of death in ALS, that's what's shown here. As far as I know, this is the largest study that exists on that. This is about 24,000 people who were diagnosed with ALS in terms of top causes of death. So, people diagnosed with ALS don't die from cancer, type two diabetes, uh, having a heart attack, cardiac arrest or major cardiovascular disease. You can see the top hit is respiratory failure. I didn't know this. I had no idea. So, so now I want to pitch this premise and piggyback on to what, Quick, quick, Mike. Quick, quick. What is ALS? Could you explain it real quick? Yeah, so it's a neurodegenerative disease, uh, it essentially it, it's a loss of, it's an accelerated loss of motor unit, motor units. So, where your muscles become atrophic, sarcopenic, you can't use them anymore because you lose the connection, you lose the muscle. So, uh, all right, so what I'm going to pitch here, too, is that even without an ALS diagnosis, if we escape, just like you've been saying, if we escape all major diseases, neurodegeneration and respiratory failure, just like in ALS, is a likely cause of death. So, why would I think that's true? So, to illustrate that, let's take a look at which biomarkers are linked with neurodegeneration. And one of those is neurofilament light chain, or NFL. I'm going to refer to it as, uh, NFL, which is a biomarker of axonal injury, which precedes neurodegeneration. And we'll see that here. So, this is a simple picture of a neuron. And when there is injury to the axon, neurofilaments are released, and then we can detect them in the blood. So, neurofilament light chain is one of those biomarkers of axonal injury, again, which precedes neurodegeneration. So, why this is important is because serum levels of NFL are two times higher in ALS patients, which is what we'll see here. So, on the Y axis, we've got circulating levels of NFL, and then in controls, which had an average age, relatively young, 68 years old, and ALS patients, 58 years old. And we can see that the average levels of NFL, circulating levels, in ALS patients were about 40 picograms per ml, which is approximately double in the healthy controls, around 20 picograms per ml. But what I also want to highlight is, take a look at the upper limit for the highest levels of NFL in the ALS patients, somewhere around 110 picograms per ml. So, remember these numbers, 20, 40, and 110, controls, ALS average, ALS at the highest. And the reason those numbers are important, because as I mentioned, now for the second time, even if, even without an ALS diagnosis, if we escape all the major diseases, neurodegeneration and respiratory failure being that likely cause of death. So, why is that? Well, serum NFL isn't just increased, twofold higher in ALS patients. It increases during aging. And that's what we'll see here. And I'm going to use two studies, I'm going to use two studies to illustrate this point. And I have a video coming so people who may have already seen the video are also going to see this again. So, apologies for that, but these are extremely important topics that I think we should be getting out there. So, and these aren't the only two studies that exist on serum levels of NFL during aging. There are many others, but these are just two that are representative. So, on the Y axis, serum levels of NFL plotted against age. And we can see that the median values, that yellow trend line, increases the, the NFL increases during aging. Such that in youth, at the upper limit, at very, you know, even at the highest levels in youth, and these are in healthy people, it's only about eight picograms per ml, very low. And then, average values of 65 year olds, still very low, not even close to average values in ALS, serum NFL levels, only about 10. But then we start to get closer to that at the highest level in the 65 year olds, as their average value, or based on extrapolation of the average value, would be around 25. Still not in the range of where we see for ALS. But, here's where it gets interesting. You know, the name of my channel and your channel, similarly, is conquer aging or die trying, not live to 65 and die, right? It's live as long as possible, super longevity if we can. So, this isn't a linear model. This is a, you know, a spline curve, but they did have a linear model here. And what that means is that we can predict the NFL level for someone 100 years old, if we know the linear regression equation, which is what they provided in the paper. So, if we know age and sex, male or female, one being male, zero being female, and plug those numbers in, we can get a reasonable estimation of what NFL levels are at 100 or even older. Now, I should mention that the regression equation is trained within the 20 to 65 year age range. So, extrapolating beyond that is a bit of speculation, and the regression equation may not be perfect for that situation, but it still can give us some, uh, approximation of what we would expect to see for NFL levels at very high, older ages. So, when plugging in the numbers for a 106 year old, now look at NFL. 40 picograms per ml. The average value at ALS is now the average value for 106 year old who may not have ALS. Now, let's take it even a step further. Let's say we get beyond the human longevity limit, 122 years. We achieve super longevity, you know, as you're always saying, these longevity gurus, who are saying, I'm going to live to 150 and so on, so. They're not thinking about this. But they should be because, Nope. Nope. Nope. if we get to, they don't, you're, yes, if if they get to 148, by plugging the numbers in for 148 into the regression equation, and one for male, now NFL, predicted NFL is 110 picograms per ml. This is the highest value in an ALS patient that I showed for the study before. So, if we're going to achieve super longevity, we may have neurodegeneration to the same level of ALS without having ALS. All right? So, this is one study. Are there other studies that support this? So, study number two, same setup, NFL plotted against age. Now, the age range goes up to 85 years. Same trend, NFL increases during aging. And average values in the 85 year olds are higher than where they were in the younger study, up to 65. Now at 25 picograms per ml. So, someone could say, all right, 25 isn't 40. But then I would say, well, 85 isn't 122. I want to know what's the predicted NFL for someone who lives to older than 100 years. So, fortunately, this paper also included a regression, a linear regression equation, and if we know age, we can predict NFL. And here, too, I have to give the caveat that the regression equation is going to be most accurate, or closest to accurate up to 85 years because that's what their data was trained on. So, there is some speculation and extrapolation. Gotcha, gotcha. Yes. I have to say that, I have to say that for everybody. Of course, of course, of course. So, when we plug the numbers in, Same thing. Same thing, NFL levels at 104, very close to the other study, 40 picograms. Yeah. The average value for ALS found at 104 years. And if we push that further at 135 years, the highest NFL value found in ALS would be found in someone without ALS of 110 picograms per ml. So, the person, Mike, could you open second? So, the person could have, So, the person could have, no diseases. Nope. Yep. But have this. 100%. So, in other words, you could do everything right. You could, you could do everything right, you could do everything right, you could you they created a pill where where everything is perfect, all your biomarkers are perfect, but you would still have this. Yes. And I think there are two ways that this goes, right? So, on the one hand, you may have people who are super fit, who resist, uh, who are slowing the motor unit loss during aging. But then they're not paying attention to CBD, cancer, type two diabetes. And maybe they die before they, You do everything right. You need to do everything right. Yes. For those of us in this community, right? We're all focused on CBD, cancer, all the things. And maybe we're not taking care of that motor units and neurodegeneration biomarkers and in addition to everything, what else can we do to slow it? So, I agree with you. This, you just messed me up with this. You just messed, you blew my mind with this. I blew my mind with this. And I have a longer video, but this is a part, part of it. So, so I just showed the what is, but what can we do about it in addition to exercise, right? So, part of that story, in your chaos training is probably a great approach because you're constantly, the, you know, the nervous system is constantly, constantly firing, giving it the stimulus to stay younger and healthy. But, you know, my passion, obviously, too, is not just exercise, but biomarkers. So, we can measure NFL, but you can see, it's a very expensive test. I think very few people are going to measure this a few times per year, it's too expensive. But, there are other biomarkers that are associated with NFL that I am currently measuring that maybe as good as a measurement of NFL levels. And if we know some of the biochemistry underlying neurodegeneration, in addition to exercise, maybe there are things we can do. And we talked about this, and I'll put it, you know, for later in the video for people who, who, who are interested. You know, there are things, the supplements that may be able to help with the motor, motor neuron health, reduce oxidative stress in in the motor neurons, you know, things that can potentially improve motor neuron health and function in addition to exercise to slow motor, motor neuron unit loss. So, one biomarker group that may be related to neurodegeneration are diacylglycerides. So, in this study, they found that the diacylglycerides, so, triglycerides are a glycerol backbone and three fatty acids. Diglycerides are a glycerol backbone and two fatty acids. So, very structurally similar to a triglyceride. This diglyceride which contains oleic acid, 18-1, 18-1, so, two fatty acids of oleic acid. In is, with NFL levels on the X axis, and this is in ALS patients. We can see that there was a significant correlation between the two. In other words, higher levels of this diglyceride were significantly associated with higher levels of this biomarker of neurodegeneration and vice versa, low levels of the diglyceride, low levels of neurodegeneration. Now, one one metabolite really doesn't mean anything for me. There was a group of them. A group of diacylglycerides, here there were seven of them that were significantly higher. You can see, significantly higher based on their adjusted P value, in the ALS patients versus controls. Okay? How much higher? For that we go to the log FC. This is the log two-fold change. And on its surface, you know, 4.17 fold may look like four times higher, but no, this is a a base two log two-fold change. So, what that means that, That's a logarithm, that's a logarithm. Logarithm. Yes. What this means is that that diglyceride, 18-1, 18-1, wasn't fourfold higher, it was 18 times higher in ALS versus controls. And for the diglyceride that was the lowest FC, it was six times higher. So, these diacylglycerides, this seven diacylglycerides, which can be measured, four of them I I have a kit that I'm measuring, I've measured now 20 times. Four of these diacylglycerides can be measured, they were 6 to 18 times higher in ALS patients and controls. Now, does that mean if we track them, and potentially keep them low, that we can keep NFL levels low and slow neurodegeneration and preserve motor neuron, motor neuron, it's hard for me to say that, MNUs during aging? I don't know. There's no published data. I'm not going to wait around for the published studies to do those experiments. But, I'm making this. I'm making, Yeah, so, I'm going to make the, Okay, okay. I want to ask you a question. I want to ask you a question. Yes, so I have more and in a longer video, but that's, uh, yeah. I just wanted to share the ALS. Diglycerides, di means two, and tri means three. The diglycerides, what did you say it was? Oleic acid? This one, yeah, 18-1, 18-1 is oleic acid. Now, oleic acid, which is olive oil, you would think that it that this doesn't mean that olive oil is unhealthy. That's not at all what this says. There are many mechanisms where diacylglycerides basically form, you know, oleic acid bound to them. You and you can have different fatty acids, you could have diglycerides with P-A, D-H-A. I don't eat, I don't, I don't eat any oleic acid. I don't, I don't, I don't consume it. I don't put it on on my foods. So, the body can make it though. And, you know, But the body can make it. So, the essential fatty acids would be like, you know, omega-3, omega-6. Oleic acid our body can make. I take that, I take a lot of that. Three thousand a day of that. Yep. But the question is why would our body be making more of it? Is that a protective thing against, uh, NFL, neurodegeneration? Because it could be upregulated to try to protect against neurodegeneration. We don't know. Well, let me ask you this. Let me ask you this, Mike. If you can slow the increase of NFL, keep it down. How does that help, how do I say this? Motor units depend on movements, on powerful movements. That's their food. You understand? It's not, the diet, the diet, I guess helps the structure, but to activate them, to keep them young, they depend on on on movement. 100%. Depending on on depending on which motor unit it is. So, what I'm saying is that even though this is a good idea, you still have to train. Yes. I would never say, Nope. right? Just be calorie restricted, live in a cage, don't exercise. Right, right. You still have to train. Exercise the foundation, but it's the, it's the raw materials, right? So, just like the people who die of aging. Oh, I got you. Yes. And I don't know what the, I don't know what the recipe is for the raw materials, but if we're lacking anything, everything. You said it right. See, people watch my channel. They think all I care about is the past. No, I watch my, I'm so, I'm so picky about what I eat. I watch everything. I just don't measure everything. But, you have to do everything right. You can't, you have to do everything right, everything. It's not, some people are just lucky and they reach 100, but I don't think I'm that lucky. I don't think I have those kind of genes. So, I'll have to do everything right. And, that's just an opinion. I mean, I it's not just training. You got perfect sleep, supplements. I, you need to do it all. You know, like Brian Johnson, he does it all. I I I I know he, he does a lot, but he's got the gist of it. You need to do everything. Yeah. You know. Good stuff. Good stuff, Tony. I you just messed me, you just blew my mind with this, with this. And I I I'm going to research this when I when I when I leave you later. I'm going to I'm going to go right into this. Because I know I knew about ALS. We all suffer from ALS, a slow, a slow motion ALS. That's what the loss of motor units is. Yep. I didn't know this guy had had a, what's his name? The guy in the wheelchair. Stephen Hawking. Stephen Hawking. He lasted 55 years. Five years. Yeah. And I looked, that has to be a record. That has to be a record. I looked, I was like, okay, what, what was he doing? There's got to be, what was this magic recipe? I mean, you know, what are they feeding him, what supplements, what is it? This is very important. This is very important. We we have to find out what they gave him. Yeah. No, because if he lived 55 years, and we are, we are normal people without the disease, we may be able to use this. Yes. He may be, he may be the proof of something. And this is what you came up with? From, this is what you, you discovered after researching him? So, there's more, well, Hawking is just the example of ALS, because most people probably don't know, you know, maybe they don't know he had ALS or, you know, I didn't know. I didn't know he had ALS. I didn't know this. Yeah, yeah. But, uh, the, the biomarkers, you know, that's my interest, that's my passion, tracking the biomarkers in addition to the exercise, right? You know, it's, this is, this is the tip of the iceberg. This is the tip of the iceberg. There are other biomarkers, for example, cystatin C, you know, the kidney, and I put it in quotes, kidney function biomarker, cystatin C. You know what, do you know, do you know what cystatin C correlates with, uh, anti anti pro BNP. And a marker of heart failure. Yeah. And NFL. So, it's not, Wow. I didn't know that. I didn't know this. I I got more. There's more. There's, uh, there's a I didn't know this part. Yeah. So, there are other biomarkers, and I've got a couple others in mind, not just diglycerides that are involved, So, again, with the diglycerides, we don't know if that's correlation or cause. We don't know if it's compensatory or it's a marker of an actual thing where higher diglycerides is somehow involved in higher neurodegeneration, or it's upregulated to try to protect. We don't know. But by looking at as many of the, you know, my passion, if we're looking at as many of these biomarkers and the biochemistry of youth and low degen, uh, degenerative status, maybe we can further delay it in addition to exercise. That's, that's my, You see, Mike. What I what I am researching, the motor unit, I don't, it's not a theory. People say motor unit theory. Motor units is not a theory. It is the cause. It is causal. It it it happens in everyone. It's not like I'm I'm theorizing. No, every single person in the world slows down. You every everyone slows down. And it's because of the mo, the gradual loss of motor units. It is causal. See, and that's why I consider it, I consider the loss of fast motor units the primary, I don't want to say it, you know, because it happens before everything else. It hap, in a normal person, in an average person, normal, healthy person, the first thing that happens to you, without you knowing it, there is nothing else. You don't get telomere attrition. You don't get telomere disease before loss of fast motor units. Fast, like I said in my study, fast motor units supersedes all of it, all of it. The loss of fast motor units is the beginning. Maybe I'm wrong. I'm hypothesizing. Is there something else before motor units? I couldn't find anything. I couldn't find anything. So, I think, I think, Yep. So, I think for skeletal muscle, for heart function, I think you're spot on. But I think there's also a window of organs that may not be, may be indirectly affected, but may not be. Indirectly, yes. So, for example, No, no, no, no, no. Like me. For kidney function, for kidney function can impact and accelerate the loss of motor neurons, right? So, there may be things that that are, you know, adjacent. But I am talking about, okay, see, see, let me reverse this for that. People bring this argument with me. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm not talking about somebody that has a disease. I'm talking about if you're 20 years old, worldwide. I don't care what race you are. I don't care what you are. And you are healthy. Not because you have kidney, sure there are many things that cause neural losses, many things that cause this. But I'm talking about in a healthy person, you start losing fast twitch motor units even if you are super healthy. You understand? Sure, there are many things that cause it. But why without that? Why do we lose them if we're healthy? So, I I think at some point there are the people who are writing papers like hallmarks of aging, they're going to include the motor unit, I don't know, it's not a theory. People say motor unit theory. Motor units is not a theory. It is the cause. It is causal. It it it happens in everyone. It's not like I'm theorizing. No, every single person in the world slows down.

I don't care what you are. And you are healthy. Not because you have kidney, sure there are many things that caused neural losses. Many things that caused this. But I'm talking about in a healthy person, you start losing fast twitch motor units, even if you are super healthy. You understand? Sure, there are many things that cause it. But why without that? Why do we lose them if we're healthy? So, I I think at some point there are the people who are writing papers like hallmarks of aging, they're going to include the motor unit, I don't know, it's not a theory. People say motor unit theory. Motor units is not a theory. It is the cause. It is causal. It it it happens in everyone. It's not like I'm theorizing. No, every single person in the world slows down. You everyone slows down. And it's because of the mo the gradual loss of motor units. It is causal. See, and that's why I consider it, I consider the loss of fast motor units the primary, I don't want to say it, you know, because it happens before everything else. It hap, in a normal person, in an average person, normal, healthy person, the first thing that happens to you, without you knowing it, there is nothing else. You don't get telomere attrition. You don't get telomere disease before loss of fast motor units. Fast, like I said in my study, fast motor units supersedes all of it, all of it. The loss of fast motor units is the beginning. Maybe I'm wrong. I'm hypothesizing. Is there something else before motor units? I couldn't find anything. I couldn't find anything. That's why I said, Yep. So, I think for, Yep. So, I think for skeletal muscle, for heart function, I think you're spot on, but I think there's also a window of organs that may not be, may be indirectly affected, but may not be. Indirectly, yes. So, for example, No, no, no, no, no. Like me. For kidney function, for kidney function can impact and accelerate the loss of motor neurons, right? So, there may be things that that are, you know, adjacent. But I am talking about, okay, see, see, let me reverse this for that. People bring this argument with me.

See, and that's why I consider it, I consider the loss of fast motor units the primary, I don't want to say it, you know, because it happens before everything else. It hap, in a normal person, in an average person, normal, healthy person, the first thing that happens to you, without you knowing it, there is nothing else. You don't get telomere attrition. You don't get telomere disease before loss of fast motor units. Fast, like I said in my study, fast motor units supersedes all of it, all of it. The loss of fast motor units is the beginning. Maybe I'm wrong. I'm hypothesizing. Is there something else before motor units? I couldn't find anything. I couldn't find anything. That's why I said, Yep. So, I think for, Yep. So, I think for skeletal muscle, for heart function, I think you're spot on, but I think there's also a window of organs that may not be, may be indirectly affected, but may not be. Indirectly, yes. So, for example, No, no, no, no, no. Like me. For kidney function, for kidney function can impact and accelerate the loss of motor neurons, right? So, there may be things that that are, you know, adjacent. But I am talking about, okay, see, see, let me reverse this for that. People bring this argument with me. Like, that's not what I'm talking about. I'm not talking about somebody that has a disease. I'm talking about if you're 20 years old, worldwide, I don't care what race you are. I don't care what you are. And you are healthy. Not because you have kidney, sure there are many things that caused neural losses. Many things that caused this. But I'm talking about in a healthy person, you start losing fast twitch motor units, even if you are super healthy. You understand? Sure, there are many things that cause it. But why without that? Why do we lose them if we're healthy?

So, for example, No, no, no, no, no. Like me. For kidney function, for kidney function can impact and accelerate the loss of motor neurons, right? So, there may be things that that are, you know, adjacent. But I am talking about, okay, see, see, let me reverse this for that. People bring this argument with me. Like, that's not what I'm talking about. I'm not talking about somebody that has a disease. I'm talking about if you're 20 years old, worldwide, I don't care what race you are. I don't care what you are. And you are healthy. Not because you have kidney, sure there are many things that caused neural losses. Many things that caused this. But I'm talking about in a healthy person, you start losing fast twitch motor units, even if you are super healthy. You understand? Sure, there are many things that cause it. But why without that? Why do we lose them if we're healthy? So, I I think at some point there are the people who are writing papers like hallmarks of aging, they're going to include the motor unit, I don't know, it's not a theory. People say motor unit theory. Motor units is not a theory. It is the cause. It is causal. It it it happens in everyone. It's not like I'm theorizing. No, every single person in the world slows down. You everyone slows down. And it's because of the mo the gradual loss of motor units. It is causal. See, and that's why I consider it, I consider the loss of fast motor units the primary, I don't want to say it, you know, because it happens before everything else. It hap, in a normal person, in an average person, normal, healthy person, the first thing that happens to you, without you knowing it, there is nothing else. You don't get telomere attrition. You don't get telomere disease before loss of fast motor units. Fast, like I said in my study, fast motor units supersedes all of it, all of it. The loss of fast motor units is the beginning. Maybe I'm wrong. I'm hypothesizing. Is there something else before motor units? I couldn't find anything. I couldn't find anything. That's why I said, Yep. So, I think for, Yep.

Why do we lose them if we're healthy? So, I I think at some point there are the people who are writing papers like hallmarks of aging, they're going to include the motor unit, I don't know, it's not a theory. People say motor unit theory. Motor units is not a theory. It is the cause. It is causal. It it it happens in everyone. It's not like I'm theorizing. No, every single person in the world slows down. You everyone slows down. And it's because of the mo the gradual loss of motor units. It is causal. See, and that's why I consider it, I consider the loss of fast motor units the primary, I don't want to say it, you know, because it happens before everything else. It hap, in a normal person, in an average person, normal, healthy person, the first thing that happens to you, without you knowing it, there is nothing else. You don't get telomere attrition. You don't get telomere disease before loss of fast motor units. Fast, like I said in my study, fast motor units supersedes all of it, all of it. The loss of fast motor units is the beginning. Maybe I'm wrong. I'm hypothesizing. Is there something else before motor units? I couldn't find anything. I couldn't find anything. That's why I said, Yep. So, I think for, Yep. So, I think for skeletal muscle, for heart function, I think you're spot on, but I think there's also a window of organs that may not be, may be indirectly affected, but may not be. Indirectly, yes. So, for example, No, no, no, no, no. Like me. For kidney function, for kidney function can impact and accelerate the loss of motor neurons, right? So, there may be things that that are, you know, adjacent. But I am talking about, okay, see, see, let me reverse this for that. People bring this argument with me. Like, that's not what I'm talking about. I'm not talking about somebody that has a disease. I'm talking about if you're 20 years old, worldwide, I don't care what race you are. I don't care what you are. And you are healthy. Not because you have kidney, sure there are many things that caused neural losses. Many things that caused this.

You don't get telomere disease before loss of fast motor units. Fast, like I said in my study, fast motor units supersedes all of it, all of it. The loss of fast motor units is the beginning. Maybe I'm wrong. I'm hypothesizing. Is there something else before motor units? I couldn't find anything. I couldn't find anything. That's why I said, Yep. So, I think for, Yep. So, I think for skeletal muscle, for heart function, I think you're spot on, but I think there's also a window of organs that may not be, may be indirectly affected, but may not be. Indirectly, yes. So, for example, No, no, no, no, no. Like me. For kidney function, for kidney function can impact and accelerate the loss of motor neurons, right? So, there may be things that that are, you know, adjacent. But I am talking about, okay, see, see, let me reverse this for that. People bring this argument with me. Like, that's not what I'm talking about. I'm not talking about somebody that has a disease. I'm talking about if you're 20 years old, worldwide, I don't care what race you are. I don't care what you are. And you are healthy. Not because you have kidney, sure there are many things that caused neural losses. Many things that caused this. But I'm talking about in a healthy person, you start losing fast twitch motor units, even if you are super healthy. You understand? Sure, there are many things that cause it. But why without that? Why do we lose them if we're healthy? So, I I think at some point there are the people who are writing papers like hallmarks of aging, they're going to include the motor unit, I don't know, it's not a theory. People say motor unit theory. Motor units is not a theory. It is the cause. It is causal. It it it happens in everyone. It's not like I'm theorizing. No, every single person in the world slows down. You everyone slows down. And it's because of the mo the gradual loss of motor units. It is causal. See, and that's why I consider it, I consider the loss of fast motor units the primary, I don't want to say it, you know, because it happens before everything else.

Like, that's not what I'm talking about. I'm not talking about somebody that has a disease. I'm talking about if you're 20 years old, worldwide, I don't care what race you are. I don't care what you are. And you are healthy. Not because you have kidney, sure there are many things that caused neural losses. Many things that caused this. But I'm talking about in a healthy person, you start losing fast twitch motor units, even if you are super healthy. You understand? Sure, there are many things that cause it. But why without that? Why do we lose them if we're healthy? So, I I think at some point there are the people who are writing papers like hallmarks of aging, they're going to include the motor unit, I don't know, it's not a theory. People say motor unit theory. Motor units is not a theory. It is the cause. It is causal. It it it happens in everyone. It's not like I'm theorizing. No, every single person in the world slows down. You everyone slows down. And it's because of the mo the gradual loss of motor units. It is causal. See, and that's why I consider it, I consider the loss of fast motor units the primary, I don't want to say it, you know, because it happens before everything else. It hap, in a normal person, in an average person, normal, healthy person, the first thing that happens to you, without you knowing it, there is nothing else. You don't get telomere attrition. You don't get telomere disease before loss of fast motor units. Fast, like I said in my study, fast motor units supersedes all of it, all of it. The loss of fast motor units is the beginning. Maybe I'm wrong. I'm hypothesizing. Is there something else before motor units? I couldn't find anything. I couldn't find anything. That's why I said, Yep. So, I think for, Yep. So, I think for skeletal muscle, for heart function, I think you're spot on, but I think there's also a window of organs that may not be, may be indirectly affected, but may not be. Indirectly, yes. So, for example, No, no, no, no, no. Like me. For kidney function, for kidney function can impact and accelerate the loss of motor neurons, right? So, there may be things that that are, you know, adjacent. But I am talking about, okay, see, see, let me reverse this for that. People bring this argument with me.

You everyone slows down. And it's because of the mo the gradual loss of motor units. It is causal. See, and that's why I consider it, I consider the loss of fast motor units the primary, I don't want to say it, you know, because it happens before everything else. It hap, in a normal person, in an average person, normal, healthy person, the first thing that happens to you, without you knowing it, there is nothing else. You don't get telomere attrition. You don't get telomere disease before loss of fast motor units. Fast, like I said in my study, fast motor units supersedes all of it, all of it. The loss of fast motor units is the beginning. Maybe I'm wrong. I'm hypothesizing. Is there something else before motor units? I couldn't find anything. I couldn't find anything. That's why I said, Yep. So, I think for, Yep. So, I think for skeletal muscle, for heart function, I think you're spot on, but I think there's also a window of organs that may not be, may be indirectly affected, but may not be. Indirectly, yes. So, for example, No, no, no, no, no. Like me. For kidney function, for kidney function can impact and accelerate the loss of motor neurons, right? So, there may be things that that are, you know, adjacent. But I am talking about, okay, see, see, let me reverse this for that. People bring this argument with me. Like, that's not what I'm talking about. I'm not talking about somebody that has a disease. I'm talking about if you're 20 years old, worldwide, I don't care what race you are. I don't care what you are. And you are healthy. Not because you have kidney, sure there are many things that caused neural losses. Many things that caused this. But I'm talking about in a healthy person, you start losing fast twitch motor units, even if you are super healthy. You understand? Sure, there are many things that cause it. But why without that? Why do we lose them if we're healthy?
